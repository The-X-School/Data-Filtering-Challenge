We can detect regular periodic bursts of electromagnetic radiation that these stars emit as they spin. Some of them spin very fast - up to 1000 revolutions per second!\n\nThe very first pulsar was accidentally discovered in 1967 by Jocelyn Bell and Antony Hewish. Bell and Hewish were studying known radio sources with a large radio telescope at Cambridge University, when they detected periodic bursts of radio noise, apparently originating from one of these sources. At first the regularity of the pulses led scientists to speculate that they might be signals from extraterrestrial life, but as more similar sources were discovered, an explanation of their behavior became more clear.\n\n(c) 1996 STSCI\n\nGalaxies sprinkle the sky in this image obtained by the Hubble Space Telescope. The area of sky in this image could be covered by a dime held 75 feet away.\n\nThe discovery of this pulsar and three others from Cambridge was soon followed by more discoveries at observatories around the world. All of the new objects behaved the same way, emitting short pulses of noise at a specific period that remained constant for each pulsar. The first pulsar, later named PSR 1919+21 because of its location on the sky, emitted a pulse every 1.33 seconds and the others had signature periods in the neighborhood of one to a few seconds. More recently, pulsars have been discovered which emit as many as 1000 pulses per second.\n\nSince 1967 over one thousand pulsars have been discovered and catalogued, and it is now estimated that our own galaxy, the Milky Way, contains perhaps as many as one million pulsars. So why do we continue to look for new pulsars? What could possibly be so interesting about them that one thousand of them is not enough? Why do we even use radio telescopes to observe some the known pulsars as often as twice a month?"}

Chemical Abundances for 855 Giants in the Globular Cluster Omega Centauri (NGC 5139) says that in this respect, Omega Centauri differs even from dwarf spheroidals, in that Type Ia supernovae played a minimal role in enriching the stars in the Omega Centauri system. Instead, its metallicity is dominated by the injection of elements produced by Type II supernovae early in the system's history, and \"pollution\" caused by intermediate mass stars in the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase, where certain elements found preferentially in Omega Centauri can form, and then are ejected because AGB stars are unstable.\n\nWell, I was curious enough to ask in the first place, so I figured I'd look myself if no one had the answer at the ready.

{"text": "Back in the 18th century, scientists like Laplace has already pointed out that highly compact objects might prevent their nearby light from escaping. Soon after Einstein published his General Theory of Relativity in the beginning of 20th century, Karl Schwarzschild found a mathematical solution of the theory to describe the spacetime structure of such object with spherical symmetry. That was the prelude to the study of black holes. Later on, Oppenheimer and others through calculation proved that supermassive stars under gravitational force could really collapse to form black holes. By the 70's, astronomers started to carry out systematic observations to look for evidence of black holes in binary system. The flush of observational evidence from the Hubble Space Telescope launched at the end of the 20th century further convinces us that black holes really exist. To the surprise of astronomers, black holes come in various sizes and origins, and are far more complicated than we can think of. For example, the sizes of black holes can vary immensely from a few to a few billions of solar masses! What is more important, the existence of these different kinds of black holes and the respective astronomical phenomena associated with them always brings far-reaching revelation to our understanding of the evolution of stars, galaxies and at last the whole Universe.\n\nIn the early days, man turned their eyes to the binary systems to look for black holes. From the spectral analysis of the orbit, if the invisible companion of a star in a binary system is 3.5 times heavier than that of the Sun, this dark celestial object is most probably a black hole. We take 3.5 solar masses as the benchmark for judging whether something is a black hole because we know that theoretically the mass of other compact objects (like neutron star) cannot exceed that maximum threshold. Otherwise those bodies will collapse under their own gravitational force into black holes. However, it is never an easy task to determine the mass of companion stars in binary systems just by way of spectral analysis. Miscalculations did always happen, as it is difficult to accurately measure factors like the luminosity of the visible stars in the pairs and the tilting of the orbits. Accretion disks formed when compact objects suck in matters of companion stars may also betray the existence of black holes. For neutron stars and black holes, accretion disk will emit high-energy X-rays when matters are spiraling in the compact objects, since immense gravitational force can cause substantial heat up of the matters. Searching for X-ray sources in the sky becomes the most important ways to locate neutron stars and black holes among binary system."}

{"text": "^ That's a section of galaxy M83 in a composite image of Chandra X-ray and optical data. The large, deep pink spot at the top middle is a new ultraluminous X-ray source, or \"ULX\"; these are objects that give off more gamma ray radiation than typical binary systems, or \"as much energy in X-rays as a million suns radiate at all wavelengths.\" In the case of the most powerful ULXs, the suggestion is that one of the binary partners is a very large black hole, on the order of 40 to 100 solar masses; the largest known stellar mass black hole in our galaxy, by comparison, is more like 15 solar masses.\n\nBut there are a few even more unusual things about this particular ULX. One is its high variability: \"the source had increased in X-ray brightness by at least 3,000 times [between 2000 and 2010] and has since become the brightest X-ray source in M83,\" says NASA. The other is the age of its stellar companion, which is thought to be a red giant, about 500 million years old; in a binary system, the two bodies are usually about the same age, having formed from the same source, so the implication is that this black hole is about 500 million years old. Other ULXs before this one had hot, bright young blue stars for companions, so this is the first time astronomers have seen evidence for a large stellar mass black hole this old.\n\nThis suggests that there could be many more old black holes drifting around, which I suppose most astronomers would predict--given that very large stars almost invariably form black holes at the end of their relatively brief lives, in theory--but they're usually darned hard to spot, so they got a bit lucky that they were looking when this one started eating some material and sending out X-rays (and that its jet was pointing directly at us, of course).

The large, deep pink spot at the top middle is a new ultraluminous X-ray source, or \"ULX\"; these are objects that give off more gamma ray radiation than typical binary systems, or \"as much energy in X-rays as a million suns radiate at all wavelengths.\" In the case of the most powerful ULXs, the suggestion is that one of the binary partners is a very large black hole, on the order of 40 to 100 solar masses; the largest known stellar mass black hole in our galaxy, by comparison, is more like 15 solar masses.\n\nBut there are a few even more unusual things about this particular ULX. One is its high variability: \"the source had increased in X-ray brightness by at least 3,000 times [between 2000 and 2010] and has since become the brightest X-ray source in M83,\" says NASA. The other is the age of its stellar companion, which is thought to be a red giant, about 500 million years old; in a binary system, the two bodies are usually about the same age, having formed from the same source, so the implication is that this black hole is about 500 million years old. Other ULXs before this one had hot, bright young blue stars for companions, so this is the first time astronomers have seen evidence for a large stellar mass black hole this old.\n\nThis suggests that there could be many more old black holes drifting around, which I suppose most astronomers would predict--given that very large stars almost invariably form black holes at the end of their relatively brief lives, in theory--but they're usually darned hard to spot, so they got a bit lucky that they were looking when this one started eating some material and sending out X-rays (and that its jet was pointing directly at us, of course). I tend to think that once a good way of detecting the quiet black holes is hit upon, we'll find that there are oodles and oodles of them, young and old, pretty much everywhere stars have been."}

So I think this scenario is more likely with dead stars. Also it should be noted that medium sized stars (those that don't become supernovae at the end of their lives) only lose a fraction of their masses due to fusion or stellar wind. So they still retain a lot of mass when they become white dwarfs or neutron stars but not enough energy to resist collapse into a black hole."}

But if we could see the sky in the most powerful form of energy -- gamma rays -- the Sun would look dark, because it rarely produces any gamma rays at all. Instead, gamma rays come from some of the most powerful objects and events in the entire universe.\n\nThrough gamma-ray eyes, the sky would be ablaze with objects -- some of them inside the galaxy, but many of them far beyond.\n\nInside the galaxy, we'd see flickering pulsars, which are the spinning corpses of exploded stars. And we'd see a background glow from collisions between particles known as cosmic rays.\n\nOutside the galaxy, we'd see the hot disks of material swirling around black holes in the hearts of galaxies.\n\nAnd once a day or so, we'd see the brilliant flash of a gamma-ray burst -- an object that would briefly shine brighter than the Sun appears to our \"\u0153normal\"\u009d vision.

{"text": "The Milky Way's first light\n\nIn its youngest days, our galaxy may have favored producing stars like Vega and Regulus.\n\nBy\nKen Croswell \u2014\nPublished:\nJanuary 6, 2005\n\nThe stars in M15 are estimated to be about 12 billion years old. They were among the first generations of stars to have formed in the Milky Way.\n\nPhoto by AURA / STScI / NASA\n\nJanuary 6, 2005 The ancient Milky Way abounded with stars a few times more massive than the Sun, say astronomers in Italy and the United States. These stars left their mark by showering their stellar companions with carbon, barium, and other elements.\n\nThe stars in M15 in Pegasus are estimated to be about 12 billion years old. The Milky Way has no globular clusters more iron-poor than M15 or M92 in Hercules. Extremely iron-poor clusters probably disrupted quickly.\n\nPhoto by AURA / STScI / NASA\n\nToday, most stars are born with less mass than the Sun. But theorists have long speculated the ancient Milky Way gave birth to stars with a different distribution of masses, or initial mass function. In particular, the ancient Milky Way's initial mass function may have favored the birth of stars more massive than the Sun.\n\nTheorists reason as follows. Stars form from clouds of cold gas. Carbon and oxygen cool the gas, allowing it to fragment into smaller clouds that create smaller stars. However, the ancient galaxy had little carbon or oxygen. Thus, the gas did not easily fragment, so the ancient Milky Way gave birth to a greater proportion of massive stars.\n\nUnfortunately, observational evidence in support of this idea has been scant. That's because the galactic halo \u2014 the Milky Way's oldest component \u2014 is about 13 billion years old, and stars more massive than the Sun don't live that long. So any such stars that arose in the halo are dead and gone.\n\nNow, Sara Lucatello, Raffaele Gratton, and Eugenio Carretta of the Astronomical Observatory of Padova and Timothy Beers of Michigan State University have studied the stars that orbited some of those deceased halo stars. They report what they call \"the first direct observational evidence that the IMF [initial mass function] of stars is not universal over time.\" The astronomers will publish their work in an upcoming issue of The Astrophysical Journal.\n\nLucatello and her colleagues studied stars in the galactic halo with extremely low abundances of iron \u2014 less than 1/300 the Sun's abundance. These stars formed long ago, before supernovae had contributed much iron to the Milky Way. As a result, the stars acquired little iron at birth.\n\nHowever, about 20 percent of these extremely iron-poor stars have high levels of carbon and barium relative to iron. As Lucatello and her colleagues report in another paper to appear in The Astrophysical Journal, these carbon- and barium-rich stars are double, orbited by white dwarf stars.\n\nThe white dwarfs were once more massive stars, probably born with 1.5 to 6 times the Sun's mass. Modern examples of such stars include Vega and Regulus. As they age, these stars expand into red giants.\n\nRed giants create most of the universe's carbon. They also manufacture weightier elements, such as barium (atomic number 56), by releasing a slow flux of neutrons that transforms iron nuclei into heavier ones. In addition to barium, this so-called s-process (\"s\" for \"slow\") forges many other elements, including strontium (atomic number 38), yttrium (atomic number 39), zirconium (atomic number 40), and lead (atomic number 82).\n\nRed giants do not explode. Instead, they die by casting off their outer atmospheres, which enrich companion stars with carbon and s-process elements. These companions are the iron-poor but carbon- and barium-rich stars that Lucatello's team studied in the galactic halo.\n\nStars with high abundances of carbon and s-process elements relative to iron are much more common in the galactic halo than in the galactic disk. Thus, the astronomers say, the ancient Milky Way formed a much greater proportion of its stars with masses between 1.5 and 6 times the Sun's. About 5 percent of all modern stars are born in this mass range \u2014 but for the ancient Milky Way, the fraction was roughly 40 percent.\n\n\"It's certainly a fundamental problem: What was the mass function of the very metal-poor stars \u2014 the earliest stars to form?\" asks halo-star expert Bruce Carney of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. \"We don't have any witnesses to that particular event \u2014 all we have are clues and circumstantial evidence \u2014 and frankly, I think this is one of the more novel approaches to the whole issue.\"\n\nThe new work may explain a long-standing puzzle. Most of the Milky Way's globular clusters belong to the halo, but while astronomers know of 1,000 halo stars with iron abundances less than 1/300 that of the Sun, there's not a single globular cluster so iron-poor. In fact, M15 in Pegasus and M92 in Hercules, both with 1/200 of the Sun's iron abundance, are two of the most extreme globulars.\n\nWhy don't clusters with lower iron abundances exist? Lucatello and her colleagues say it's because the clusters destroyed themselves. Extremely iron-poor clusters contained lots of stars with 1.5 to 6 solar masses. When these stars shed their outer atmospheres, most of the gas escaped the clusters, robbing the clusters of mass \u2014 and thus of the gravity that held them together. As a result, the clusters split apart, spilling their stars into the galaxy at large. That's why, at very low iron abundances, the Milky Way has stars but no clusters.\n\nKen Croswell earned his Ph.D. from Harvard University, where he studied the galactic halo. He is the author of a book about the Milky Way, The Alchemy of the Heavens."}

{"text": "A nova is a type of stellar explosion smaller than a supernova or hypernova. The phenomenon occurs in binary star systems, where a white dwarf star absorbs a critical amount of matter from its companion, compressing hydrogen onto its surface and eventually igniting a nuclear explosion. Only about 1/10,000 solar masses of material is ejected, in comparison to 1.38 solar masses of material in a Type I supernova and a dozen or more solar masses in a Type II supernova. Although a Type I supernova also involves a white dwarf star, in that case a majority of the star's entire mass is fused. In the case of a nova, only a tiny percentage is.\n\nA white dwarf star is made up of degenerate matter, a super-dense phase of matter with the unusual property that its pressure is only weakly related to temperature. When a white dwarf's gravitational field sucks hydrogen gas from a nearby star, the gas fuses to the surface of the dwarf, joining the degenerate matter. A white dwarf packs a mass similar to the Sun in a volume similar to that of the Earth, compressing the incoming matter very tightly.\n\nA white dwarf is the \"ash\" of a much larger star that has fused together much of its hydrogen into heavier elements. Usually, white dwarfs are composed of carbon and oxygen. Fusing carbon and oxygen nuclei into heavier elements is a very energy-intensive process that only occurs in the cores of very massive stars. So, the white dwarf lacks the capability itself to engage in further fusion reactions. But, if enough hydrogen is packed onto its surface, it forms a shell which reaches the critical temperature and pressure for hydrogen fusion, around 20 million Kelvin. The hydrogen rapidly fuses, releasing energy in the same way as a fusion-based nuclear bomb (H-bomb). A nova results.\n\nBecause a nova does not destroy its host star, it may happen more than once in the same place. One nova, RS Ophiuchi, has flared six times since astronomers began watching it in 1890."}

How accurate is that?\nIs the error plus or minus 1 million light years or what? And does that\nerror factor get much worse the farther out we go?\n\nThe Answer\n\nNearby galaxies, where you can see individual stars, probably have about a\n10% distance uncertainty.\n\nFor galaxies at distances where you can't see individual stars, the\ndistance is found by multiplying the redshift by a number called the Hubble\nConstant H0. The value of H0 is a contentious issue, but the two extreme\ncamps are arguing for ~55 or ~70 km/s/Mpc, which means that there is about\na 30% range in how far away people think any given galaxy is. The accuracy\nwith which the redshift is measured doesn't depend much on the distance to\nthe galaxy, so this is a constant factor: you know that one galaxy is 3.0\ntimes as far away as another, and not 3.1 or 2.9 times.\n\nAt distances which are a good fraction of the age of the universe away, the\nquestion is how constant the Hubble constant is. Depending on how much\nmass there is in the universe (and thus how much the universe has been\nslowed down by gravity--so how much faster it was expanding in the early\ndays) this can add an additional uncertainty range of 50%."}
{"text": "If there's all those stars, why is it dark at night?\n\nOne hundred billion galaxies, all full of millions of stars, seems like a lot but it isn't nearly enough to make the night sky as bright as day. If there were an infinite number of stars and the universe was infinitely old, there would be a star everywhere you looked in the night sky and it would be very bright indeed.\n\nBut the universe isn't infinitely old. It was created approximately 14 billion years ago and since the speed of light is constant, we can only see objects that are less than 14 billion light years away. This means that we are living within a spherical 'observable universe' which is smaller that the total universe and that the light from stars further away from us than 14 billion light years will not have had enough time to reach the Earth.\n\nIn addition, the universe is expanding and all the galaxies, and their stars, are moving away from us. Thanks to this, the light from a moving star changes colour in a similar way that sound from a moving ambulance siren changes pitch. The light that we observe from distant receding stars is more red than it would be if they were stationary \u2013 the light is 'red shifted'. In many cases the red shift is large enough to move the light out of the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum."}

{"text": "In this topic you will learn about the billions of stars of which the Sun is one.\n\nA star is a large, hot ball of gas, which is held together by gravity, and gives off its own light. Stars are actually at different distances from Earth.\n\nHow do scientists know a star's distance? If a star is close, they view it from different points in Earth's orbit. The star appears to shift its location compared with other stars farther away. This apparent shift of an object's location when viewed from two positions is called parallax. The closer a star is, the greater the shift. By measuring the shift, scientists can tell how far the star is.\n\nAstronomers use a unit called the light-year to describe distances in space. A light-year is the distance light travels in a year, or about 9 trillion kilometers. The easiest way to find a star is by looking for its constellation. A constellation is a number of stars that appear to form a pattern. Rigel is a star in the constellation Orion.\n\nSome stars are brighter than others. Sirius, in the constellation Canis Major, is the brightest star in the winter sky. It appears brighter than Rigel. However, Rigel is actually a brighter star than Sirius. The reason Sirius appears brighter is that it is closer to us than Rigel. The word magnitude is used to describe the brightness of a star. It can describe the actual brightness of a star, the absolute magnitude. It can also describe the apparent magnitude, the brightness of a star as you see it in the night sky. That depends on how much light it gives off and how far away it is.\n\nA star begins its life as a nebula, an enormous cloud of gas and dust in space. As time goes by, gravity causes the nebula to contract. As the cloud shrinks, it heats up. Eventually the center reaches a temperature of several million degrees. At these temperatures nuclear reactions occur. Four hydrogen atoms fuse and form one helium atom. Energy is released.

At this level, the resulting fundamental components are the stars, which are typically assembled in clusters from the various condensing nebulae.[5] The great variety of stellar forms are determined almost entirely by the mass, composition and evolutionary state of these stars.

{"text": "The statistical studies based on these new perceptions continued into the early 20th century. They culminated with the analysis by the Dutch astronomer Jacobus Cornelius Kapteyn who, like William Herschel before him, used number counts of stars to study their distribution in space. It can be shown for stars with an arbitrary but fixed mixture of intrinsic brightnesses that\u2014in the absence of absorption of starlight\u2014the number N of stars with apparent brightness, energy flux f, larger than a specified level f0, is given by N = Af0-3/2, where A is a constant, if the stars are distributed uniformly in Euclidean space (space satisfying the principles of Euclidean geometry). The number N would increase with decreasing limiting apparent brightness f0, because one is sampling, on average, larger volumes of space when one counts fainter sources. Kapteyn found that the number N increased less rapidly with decreasing f0 than the hypothetical value Af0-3/2; this indicated to him that the solar system lay near the centre of a distribution of stars, which thinned in number with increasing distance from the centre. Moreover, Kapteyn determined that the rate of thinning was more rapid in certain directions than in others. This observation, in conjunction with other arguments that set the scale, led him in the first two decades of the 20th century to depict the Milky Way Galaxy (then confused with the entire universe) as a rather small, flattened stratum of stars and gaseous nebulae in which the number of stars decreased to 10 percent of their central value at a distance in the plane of about 8,500 light-years from the galactic"}

Well we have an angle (0.05 arcsec) and one side of triangle (11.5Mly). This is simple trig (tan theta = opp / adj), and we can make it even simpler by using the small angle approximation (tan theta ~ theta). And 0.05 arcsec is a very small angle indeed. First we convert our angle to radians by dividing 0.05 by 206265 (the number of arcseconds in a radian). This gives us 0.0000002424 radians as our angle. Back to our trig, 11.5Mly * 0.0000002424 = 0.0000027876Mly ~ 2.8ly. So 1 pixel in an HST ACS/WFC image corresponds to 2.8ly at the distance of M82. Or, in terms of area, ~7.8ly^2/pixel.

This is one of the most sophisticated telescopes on the planet, featuring more processing power, more than 100 times the sensitivity of earlier generations, ten times the resolution and a complex design of 133 mirrors nested together like Russian stacking dolls. Of course, all this sensitivity is for an energy spectrum that we can't see, so this might seem to be a bit esoteric.\n\nBlack holes are considered to be fundamental players in the formation of the universe, driving the creation of galaxies and providing the gravitational disturbances needed to make stars coalesce.

{"text": "Exploding Star\n\nWant to stay on top of all the space news? Follow @universetoday on Twitter\n\nAn exploding star, also known as a supernova, is one of the most majestic events in the entire universe. At the climax of this event, it can outshine even an entire galaxy.\n\nIn some cases, this cataclysmic event (including its fading) can last up to many years.\n\nThere are two main types of supernovae: Type I and Type II. These two are then subdivided into subclasses like Type Ia, Ib, and Ic (for Type I) or Type IIP and Type IIL (for Type II).\n\nA Type I supernova can happen to some binary star systems (star systems made up of two stars). On the other hand, a Type II can happen to a very massive star, typically much more massive than the Sun.\n\nSome exploding stars, like the type Ib, Ic and II supernovae, are accompanied by a burst of high energy neutrinos. These neutrinos travel through space and may be detected here on Earth. It is for this reason that observatories like the Super-Kamiokande and the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory were constructed.\n\nWhen exactly a supernova can occur is hard to predict. Because of this, scientists can only start studying them when they have already occurred. This is where neutrinos play an important role. Detection of neutrinos in the observatories above may indicate the presence of an exploding star somewhere in the Universe.\n\nBecause an exploding star can really stand out in the sky (due to its extreme brightness), early astronomers were able to observe them. The earliest recorded observation of an exploding star was made by Chinese astronomers in 185 AD.\n\nWhen a supernova occurs near the Earth, its gamma rays can deplete the ozone layer and subsequently permit solar and cosmic radiation to pass through. Some scientists believe its effects are so deadly that it may have caused the end Ordovician extinction wherein 60% of the living organisms found in the ocean perished.\n\nIt has been suggested that when an exploding star is located within 100 light years away, it can pose great risks to our planet. A number of stars in our own galaxy, the Milky Way, are believed to be approaching supernovae status.\n\nRho Cassiopeiae, Eta Carinae, RS Ophiuchi, U Scorpii, HD 179821, VY Canis Majoris, Betelgeuse, Antares, and Spica, are among those that may turn into supernovae in the near future.

{"text": "The series begins with a brief introduction to star formation, covering the birth, lifetime and death of a star. The second part describes white dwarfs and neutron stars, including special types of neutron stars, such as pulsars and magnetars. This third part describes black holes.\n\nWe'll start with a brief review of the previous sections. If you're interested, you might want to read about stellar evolution, and the process that results in a black hole. Briefly, at the end of a star's life, it has no fuel left to generate any more energy. During its lifetime, a star exists in a dynamic equilibrium between two opposing forces - pressure generated by heat of nuclear fusion, which pushes outwards to make the star expand, and gravity, which pulls inwards to make it contract. When the nuclear reactor shuts down for the final time, one of these forces is lost. There is nothing left to oppose gravity, and the star begins to rapidly collapse into itself.\n\nThe Origin of Black Holes\n\nMassive stars fuse several elements during their lifetime. For most of their lives, they are in the main sequence, fusing hydrogen into helium. However, once the hydrogen in the core is exhausted, the star moves on to fusing progressively heavier elements, until it reaches iron. This is the end point in the active life of the star, since the fusion of iron (and elements heavier than iron) does not produce net energy. Such fusion reactions are endothermic - they absorb energy instead of producing it.\n\nThis puts a sudden brake on the activity of the star. There is nothing left to burn which would produce energy, therefore the star starts to collapse under gravity. Stellar collapse produces intense pressure and massive amounts of heat at the core. This energy comes from the gravitational potential energy of matter falling inwards. In large stars, the core temperature may reach 5 billion \u00b0K, or higher. This intense heat fuses the iron at the core. As mentioned, iron fusion is endothermic, so this drastically lowers the temperature of the core within a few seconds. The collapse accelerates, due to the loss of this residual heat, which was generating pressure. The rapid collapse is of the nature of an implosion - happening within a few seconds, and generates a massive shock wave. The rebound from this shock wave tears the star apart, throwing out most of its mass in the form of a Type II supernova, one of the most powerful and energetic events in the universe. The remaining core, which is usually a small fraction of the star's initial mass, is left behind.\n\nThe size of this remaining core determines what happens next. If the core is under 1.4 S (S is a solar mass, about 1.9891 x 1030 kilograms), it becomes a white dwarf. White dwarfs are very dense (having the mass of a Sun concentrated into an object about the size of the Earth), and are made of degenerate matter (electrons torn loose from their orbitals, so electrons and atomic nuclei exist as a fluid sometimes called the Fermi Sea). However the electron degeneracy pressure keeps them from collapsing any further.\n\nIf, however, the mass of the core is larger than 1.4 S (the Chandrashekhar Limit), the gravity is powerful enough that electron degeneracy pressure cannot prevent it from collapsing. The object then becomes a neutron star. The equations of state for neutron stars are not very well understood, so the nature of neutron star matter is a subject of debate. Neutron stars are much denser than white dwarfs, with their centers having higher density than an atomic nucleus. Neutron degeneracy pressure keeps them from collapsing further. However, if the core is even more massive, then neutron degeneracy pressure would not be sufficient to keep it from collapsing further.\n\nHow much more massive is a question for debate. The boundary is defined by the equations of state, which are uncertain for neutron stars. This boundary is represented by the Tolmann-Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit, which is somewhere between 1.5 S and 3 S. If a neutron star is heavier than this, it collapses into a black hole. This is where our knowledge fails, since no one knows what could be denser than neutron star matter. Some people posit an intermediate stage, with neutrons breaking down into quarks, to form a quark star. No quark star has ever been discovered. However, with the addition of more matter, this too collapses into a black hole.\n\nWhat is a Black Hole?\n\nIn simple (but not very descriptive) terms, a black hole can be considered a region of space where the gravitational field is so powerful that not even light can escape. Black holes were predicted by general relativity, though for a long time, people disputed whether they could actually exist. Einstein himself did not believe black holes were physically possible.\n\nHowever, by the 1960's, the majority of physicists were convinced that there was no known theoretical reason why black holes should not exist. Today, several black holes have been identified, both within our galaxy and outside it. It is believed that a supermassive black hole exists at the center of our own Milky Way galaxy (and at the centers of most other galaxies).\n\nTheoretically, black holes can be created by different processes. In the early universe, when the density of matter was much higher, it's possible that local perturbations could cause material to clump together and collapse into a black hole. Some people think that high energy collisions of elementary particles (such as cosmic rays, or the Large Hadron Collider), could also produce black holes. However, the best understood process for black hole formation is through the gravitational collapse of a massive object, such as a star.\n\nSchwarzschild Radius\n\nSince we've defined the black hole as a region where the gravity is so intense that not even light can escape, we can calculate a boundary around the black hole where the escape velocity equals the speed of light in vacuum.\n\nAs can be seen in the equations on the left, the formula for escape velocity can be used to calculate the radius (distance from a mass M) where the escape velocity would be equal to the speed of light. Intuitively, we can see that this would require a very dense mass, so that the entire mass was contained within this radius.\n\nThis is a quick but incorrect way to calculate the Schwarzschild Radius, using Newtonian mechanics only. It's incorrect because it doesn't strictly follow the definition of the Schwarzschild Radius, which derives from mass and gravity, not directly from the speed of light. The Schwarzschild Radius is defined as the radius of a sphere of matter that was dense and massive enough so that the force of gravity inside it was intense enough that no known degeneracy pressure could prevent it from collapsing into a \"point of infinite density\" or gravitational singularity. Therefore if any mass could be contained within its Schwarzschild Radius, it would collapse into a black hole, i.e., an object smaller than its Schwarzschild Radius is a black hole.\n\nIn 1916, Karl Schwarzschild obtained this radius by calculating an exact solution to Einstein's field equations (from general relativity) for the gravitational field outside a spherical, non-rotating body. Note that therefore this formula only works for a spherical object, which is not rotating. Since most black holes do rotate, the formula needs to be modified to take that into account.\n\nOne significance of this radius is that it acts as a one-way barrier. This is the point at which nothing can escape from the black hole's gravity, therefore matter and energy can enter this barrier, but nothing can come out. It is not a physical barrier, since matter and energy can enter, it is simply a region of space with the property that nothing inside the enclosed volume can leave it.\n\nThe sphere defined by the Schwarzschild Radius is called the event horizon. It's a one-way boundary in space-time. It would be wrong to think of it in a Newtonian fashion (imagine light trying to leave it, and being pulled back by gravity). The real situation is that all possible paths that light can take inside the event horizon are warped in towards the singularity. Therefore the forward light cone of any particle leads to the singularity - moving forward in time means moving towards the singularity.\n\nAs we can tell from the formula, the Schwarzschild radius (SR) depends upon the mass. Every mass has some Schwarzschild radius that can be calculated for it. The Schwarzschild radius for the Sun is about 3 kilometers. If the mass of the Sun could be concentrated within a radius of 3 km, the Sun would be a black hole. The Schwarzschild radius for the Earth is about 9 mm. The SR increases linearly with mass, so for each solar mass added to the black hole, the SR increases by about 3 kilometers. At this rate, the largest black hole discovered so far - OJ287 - which has a mass of 18 billion suns, would have a SR over 7 times that of the solar system.\n\nAnother interesting effect that happens near the event horizon is time dilation. Consider two observers, Alice and Bob. Alice is approaching the black hole, while Bob sits back far away, at a safe distance from it. As Alice gets closer to the black hole, it will appear to Bob that she is slowing down. The closer she gets to the black hole, the more she will seem to slow down to Bob, until she reaches the event horizon, at which point she will appear to stop. Bob will never see her enter the event horizon - it will look to him like she's stuck at the event horizon forever.\n\nThis is a thought experiment, of course, since in reality if Alice were to approach that close, she would be torn apart into atoms and there would be nothing for Bob to observe anyway. But let's disregard that for the moment. Now, from Alice's perspective, time does not slow down. She does in fact reach the event horizon, pass through, eventually to merge with the gravitational singularity inside. For Alice, the whole trip would probably take no more than a few seconds.\n\nFormulas used to calculate the Schwarzschild Radius (rS) and the time dilation seen by a distant observer for material entering the black hole.\n\nThe picture above shows Alice as Observer A, and Bob as Observer B. The dimensions are not to scale. The two equations shown are for the Schwarzschild radius (on top), and for the time dilation effect (below it). As can be seen, the Schwarzschild radius is a term in the time dilation equation, reflecting the fact the closer you get to the event horizon, the greater the apparent time dilation to an outside observer. At the event horizon, the term rS/r becomes 1, and the denominator on the right hand side becomes 0, making the equation not calculable (\"infinite\").\n\nIf you'd like to see the calculations in more detail, they are on a separate page here (will open in a new window). The page has some calculations showing how the size of the event horizon grows with the mass of the black hole, and also the effect of the gravitational field on time dilation.\n\nStructure of Black Holes\n\nA black hole typically shows the following regions. In the center is the gravitational singularity, where everything ends up. Surrounding it is a region (bounded by the event horizon on the outside) where space-time get horribly mangled. Outside the event horizon, a rotating black hole (and only rotating black holes) shows a region called the ergosphere, kind of like an oblate or stretched sphere. This is a region where space gets dragged around with the rotating black hole. Outside it is a region called the photon sphere, which has some peculiar properties relevant to light paths. All of these regions are discussed in detail below.\n\nDiagram of a black hole, showing the Schwarzschild Radius, Photon Sphere, and Ergosphere.\n\nEvent Horizon\n\nAs mentioned, this is a sphere of zero thickness that surrounds the black hole (the singularity) at a distance equal to the Schwarzschild radius. It bounds a region of space where space is curved so that no light paths beginning inside that region can ever leave it. Nothing leaves the black hole from inside its event horizon. Time as we know it, does not exist inside the event horizon.\n\nFrom the perspective of an outside observer, matter or light falling in towards the black hole would come to a halt at the event horizon (due to time dilation). We cannot see it fall in any further, since in order to see inside it would require that something carrying information about the object should leave the black hole, and nothing of the sort does. In other words, the light cone of the event of the object's crossing of the event horizon never intersects the outside observer's world line. As the object (or light) falls towards the event horizon, all processes in the object appear to slow down. If a clock were falling towards the black hole and the outside observer could read the clock's face, the clock would appear to slow down. In the case of light, it becomes ever dimmer and more red-shifted to an outside observer, as it falls towards the event horizon. Finally as it reaches the event horizon it becomes so red shifted that it can't be seen (the wavelength of light reaching the outside observer tends to infinity).\n\nThe event horizon of a non-rotating black hole is spherical, but that of a rotating black hole is somewhat distorted from a perfectly spherical shape. Again, it's important to remember, the event horizon is not a physical barrier - it's simply a mathematical concept. Nothing actually prevents matter from falling in to a black hole.\n\nThis description of the event horizon (and of black holes in general) is based on general relativity, which is not sufficient to understand what's going on inside the black hole. It is only an approximation that holds true from the perspective of an outside observer. As you get close to the event horizon, quantum gravity effects become significant. In order to model the event horizon, we would need both relativity and quantum mechanics. While we are starting to understand some of these things (for example, quantum mechanics predicts that event horizons have a certain temperature, and therefore emit radiation - Hawking Radiation), we cannot have a complete understanding of event horizons until we have a theory of quantum gravity.\n\nSo what would an event horizon look like to an outside observer, if we were close enough to a black hole to see it? Based on what we know so far, pretty much like a black, spherical region with a very sharp boundary. Objects behind it would appear \"lensed\", that is, you could actually see things directly behind the black hole as some light paths from them to you follow the highly curved space-time around the black hole. They would appear as a ring, smeared around in a circle outside the event horizon. This is called gravitational lensing, giving the appearance of Einstein rings around massive objects such as black holes. You would see swirls of matter, caught in the black hole's gravity field spiraling in towards the black hole, slowing down and then seeming to disappear as it reached the event horizon. Stars nearby would have the gases sucked out of them, spinning in long spiral tracks towards the black hole. Here's an artist's impression of what it might look like.\n\nBecause of the curvature of space and the consequent bending of light rays, the apparent size of the black hole would vary from our normal experience, when approaching it. This purely has to do with the distance to the black hole, not its actual size. Even if the black hole was quite small, at a distance of about 1.5 Schwarzschild radii, the event horizon would appear to cover half the sky. At distances closer than 1.5 Schwarzschild radii, the black hole appears to wrap around our vision and extends further behind us, giving a feeling of being surrounded by it, even though it is straight ahead. This effect is real, you can turn your head around and look back, and see that the universe behind you appears to be shrinking. Very close to the black hole (but still outside it), the black hole would appear to be everywhere around you, except for a pinpoint directly behind you. The whole universe would appear shrunk into that pinpoint. You can see what this might look like visually through a computer simulation here.\n\nSingularity\n\nThe singularity is what sits inside the black hole, where everything entering the event horizon ends up. It's a region of space where matter has infinite density, gravity is infinitely strong, and spacetime has infinite curvature. As you can tell by all the \"infinites\" we don't really have a clue what's going on. A non-rotating black hole's singularity is a dimensionless point. A rotating black hole's singularity is a ring situated along the plane of rotation (it has length and width, but zero thickness).\n\nThe appearance of singularities in general relativity show the limits of the theory - the places or conditions where the theory breaks down. At a gravitational singularity, quantum mechanical effects (specially quantum gravity effects) are dominant. At present, we have no quantum theory of gravity. When we do, we will no longer think of these things as singularities.\n\nSince there's not much we can say about singularities, let's say a few things about what they're not. The space inside the event horizon is not normal space. Time inside the event horizon is not normal time. What happens to space-time inside the event horizon is unknown. Various references describe it has \"mangled\", \"highly curved\" etc., which sound somewhat descriptive but don't say much. The singularity is simply the place where this \"mangledness\" reaches its ultimate extent. Using words which we created to reference things and events happening in space and time don't do justice to the state of affairs inside the event horizon. Therefore, saying that a singularity is a \"dimensionless point\" is not strictly true. If space as we know it doesn't exist at the singularity, what does \"dimensionless\" mean anyway? It just goes to show that along with general relativity, our language also breaks down inside the event horizon. When we do invent language to describe it (when we have a theory of quantum gravity), we will no longer call it the \"singularity\". This is not something most people care about in the ordinary course of affairs, unless they are theoretical physicists. But these concepts are often used (and misused) by people philosophizing about the nature of reality and such metaphysical questions. Then it becomes extremely important to remember what we do not know, and thus remove the temptation to derive conclusions from it.\n\nErgosphere\n\nAny rotating black hole \"pulls\" along a region of spacetime with it, due to a phenomenon called frame-dragging. As far back as 1918, the Austrian physicists Josef Lense and Hans Thirring predicted (using general relativity) that a rotating object would drag any nearby object along with it. In other words, an object close enough to a rotating black hole would start rotating around it. There is some complicated math behind it, but one way to understand it is to imagine a clock near a black hole. Because of time dilation, the clock appears to slow down, to an outside observer. If the clock starts rotating around the black hole, in the direction of rotation of the black hole, it will appear to tick faster than if it were not rotating. Time will still appear to slow down for it, to an outside observer, but it will slow down the least if the clock is rotating around the black hole in that direction. The same is true if we replace the clock with a light beam. A light beam will move around a black hole faster in the direction of rotation of the black hole.\n\nThis is simply a specific example of a more general idea of gravetomagnetism, which occurs when a mass is moving in any fashion (linearly or rotating). This terminology considers the phenomenon of frame-dragging as a fictitious force, analogous to a moving electrical charge creating a magnetic field. A moving mass creates a fictitious force, tending to pull along any nearby objects with it. There is some proof that this prediction of relativity is true, in the observation of relativistic jets emerging from black holes in quasars. Roger Penrose proved mathematically that it's possible for these relativistic jets to acquire their energy directly from the black hole, through frame dragging. There is a NASA experiment called Gravity Probe B under way, to obtain information that might corroborate frame dragging. The results should be available by 2010.\n\nRotating black holes would show this effect, dragging space along with them in the direction of their rotation. Because of this, any object close to a black hole would start rotating with it. In a region very close to the black hole, the speed of rotation exceeds the speed of light. An object in this region would therefore move faster than the speed of light. Just to be clear, it's not really the object moving faster than the speed of light, it's space itself moving at that speed. For this reason, such an object could never be stationary relative to anything outside the universe, because to be stationary, it would need to actively move in a direction opposite to that of the rotation, at a speed exceeding light. Which is not possible. This region where it's not possible for an object to remain stationary relative to an outside object is called the ergosphere. Its shape is that of an oblate spheroid - bulging at the equator, and flattened at the poles of the rotating black hole.\n\nAs one moves away from the black hole, the frame dragging effect decreases, and objects move more and more slowly. At a certain distance, they move at the speed of light (instead of faster than light when they are closer). At this point, it's possible for them to remain stationary with respect to an outside observer. This point marks the boundary of the ergosphere. The boundary of the ergosphere touches the event horizon at the poles, while at the equator (where it's maximum), it extends to a distance outside the event horizon equivalent to the Schwarzschild radius.\n\nSince the ergosphere is outside the event horizon, it's possible for an object within it to escape the black hole. When it does, it will have energy accumulated from the spinning of the black hole. This is possibly what powers the relativistic jets mentioned earlier, and Roger Penrose showed that it's theoretically possible to design a system to extract power from black holes in this fashion. Of course, any power extracted will come from the energy of the black hole, and if you extract enough energy, the black hole will stop spinning.\n\nPhoton Sphere\n\nThere is a region outside the event horizon where space is still curved enough that light can travel in complete circles. This is called the photon sphere. In a non-rotating black hole, the photon sphere is 1.5 times the Schwarzschild radius, so it's half as large again as the event horizon. Think of it this way. Since the photon sphere is outside the event horizon, it's possible for light and physical objects to escape the black hole. However, the trajectories on which they can leave the black hole are limited. Light cones have to be pretty nearly perpendicular to the surface of the event horizon in order to leave the photon sphere (the exit cone).\n\nThe photon sphere has some interesting features. Light that enters the photon sphere from outside cannot leave the black hole. However, light originating from inside the photon sphere can leave the black hole, provided that its trajectory is aimed directly away from the black hole, and not at an angle. This means that if an object is orbiting the black hole inside the photon sphere, it cannot be seen from the outside through reflected light coming in from the outside. It can only be seen if it generates light of its own, or from some source of light within the photon sphere. Another interesting feature of the photon sphere is that since light in this region can orbit the black hole, if you were inside the photon sphere you could conceivably see the back of your own head, as light leaving it could circle around and reach your eyes.\n\nThe photon sphere is just the gravitational distortion of space produced by compact bodies. Any object smaller than 1.5 times its Schwarzschild radius will have a photon sphere. This includes neutron stars.\n\nBlack Hole Growth and Evaporation\n\nBlack holes grow by accumulating more mass. All black holes absorb the interstellar dust around them, as well as any cosmic radiation headed their way. This is, however, insufficient to increase their mass significantly. In order to grow, a black hole needs a source of matter relatively close by. Black holes formed in binary systems can slowly absorb the mass of the companion star. The supermassive black holes at the centers of galaxies are thought to form by a process of merger of many smaller black holes and stellar objects.\n\nStephen Hawking showed that black holes aren't completely black, they do in fact emit some radiation. He got this result by applying quantum field theory. Many other people have also mathematically verified this result. The radiation from a black hole is called Hawking radiation, and is in a perfect black body spectrum. The amount of radiation is proportional to surface gravity of the black hole (surface gravity being the gravity at the event horizon). Since smaller black holes have much higher surface gravity than large ones, they are expected to produce a lot more radiation than larger ones.\n\nSince radiation is energy, and energy and mass are mutually interconvertible, black holes slowly lose mass as they emit radiation, and will therefore one day disappear. Stellar and galactic black holes are so large that it would take them a very long time to disappear, a time compared to which the present life of the universe is only a negligible fraction. However, small black holes can evaporate very fast. A black hole the mass of a car would evaporate in a nanosecond, having in that nanosecond, a luminosity 200 times brighter than the Sun. However it's possible that very very tiny black holes (with masses comparable to atomic particles) might have quantum gravity effects that make them stable.\n\nA black hole with a mass equal to 5 Suns has a Hawking temperature of about 12 nanokelvins. This is much less than the cosmic background radiation (2.7 K). Therefore, in today's universe, such black holes are not losing mass, they are in fact gaining mass. Only when the universe ages enough that the cosmic background radiation temperature drops below their Hawking temperature, will they start to evaporate."}

{"text": "How do we determine the life cycles of stars and tag some as \"young\" and some as \"old?\"\n\nOnly the fusion of hydrogen into helium can\nprovide enough energy to power most stars. In our models we find that choosing how much helium (and the trace amount of heavier elements)\nalmost completely determines a star's temperature and luminosity. The models that fit Red Giant's characteristics suggest that they are mostly\nhelium inside and so they must be old; the hydrogen in their cores has already been turned into helium. The models that fit White Dwarfs low\nluminosity and temperatures best suggest that no energy generation is taking place and that their cores are made of elements heavier than helium.\n\nWHITE DWARFS\n\nSo, in the end, we can make an educated guess\nabout the age of a star by the core composition of the model that fits best--and the time it would take the hydrogen to turn into the helium. This\ntakes billions of years for main sequences stars like the Sun. To turn helium into carbon and heavier elements takes much less time (only a few\nhundred million to a billion years), and it is these models that fit the observed characteristics of Red Giant stars best. So we conclude that Red\nGiants are old stars, which don't have much lifetime left.\n\nFor hydrogen-burning stars on the main sequence, such as the Sun, there is another\nway to narrow down an age. Just as the Sun has an 11 year sunspot cycle, stars also have activity cycles; they have many \"star-spots\" sometimes,\nand a few at other times. These cycles are detectable by looking for the spectral features that active surface regions emit, such as the emission lines\nof the common element calcium. Models suggest that the activity of a star, and the brightness of these spectral features, declines as a star ages.\nHence, one way of determining a main sequence star's age is to measure how bright these activity-sensitive spectral features are.\n\nHow about\nthe age of a White Dwarf star? These stars aren't making their own energy anymore, and only shine because they are still hot from their hydrogen\nand helium burning phases. They are so small and so hot that it takes billions of years for them to cool to the temperature of interstellar space,\nwhich is just a few degrees above absolute zero.\n\nThink of a cup of coffee. When first poured, it is very hot, but as time goes on the temperature\nfalls. If you know how fast a cup of coffee cools, you can measure its present temperature and determine how long it has been since it was poured.\nThe color of a White Dwarf is easy to measure, and it directly tells us its temperature. The redder it is, the cooler it is--therefore the older it is.\n\nCuriously, we find no White Dwarfs cooler than about 4,000 Kelvins. It takes a White Dwarf about 10 billion years to cool to this temperature.\nSo we conclude that even the first generation of stars in our galaxy, whose remnants are now White Dwarfs, have not had a chance to cool below\n4,000 Kelvins. By that reckoning, the galaxy, and hence the whole universe, must be at least 10 billion years"}

{"text": "Monday, November 29, 2010\n\nIt's Filamentary, Watson\n\nA recent find allowed scientists some of their best views yet of the structures or filaments of gas in space that link galaxy clusters to each other over unimaginable distances.\n\nFrom your basic elementary school astronomy, you probably remember that our planet is part of a solar system, organized around the star we call the sun. Galaxies are groups of thousands or millions of stars that are themselves organized around a center, which is sometimes thought to be a gigantic black hole, although no one knows for sure. Galaxies take different shapes, depending on how the stars are distributed and the effects of gravity among them. Galaxies themselves will tend to clump together to form clusters, which are made up of galaxies that are held together by the interplay of their own gravitation.\n\nAll of these systems and groups are held together by gravity. It used to be thought that the space in between galaxies -- \"intergalactic\" space -- was pretty much empty -- that the gravitational field produced by each galaxy was strong enough that stars or objects wandering around in it would be gradually pulled into one galaxy or another. The space in between the clusters was thought to be relatively empty as well, for mostly the same reasons.\n\nBut it isn't. There are huge filaments of gas that link the clusters to each other. And when astronomers call them \"huge,\" that's exactly what they mean. Imagine there's a tunnel through the center of the earth with one end at the North Pole and another at the South Pole (It couldn't be done, which is why we're imagining it). Say a person at the North Pole end holds a flashlight over the tunnel and turns it on. A person at the South Pole would see the light go on just about .07 seconds later. Light from our sun takes about eight minutes to reach us. But galaxy clusters are so far apart from each other that the same action would yield a light that might take millions or even billions of years to reach us. That's how huge these gassy filaments are.\n\nThey're also apparently extremely hot. Obviously nobody's stuck a turkey thermometer into one of them to see, but the radiation they emit gives scientists some clues, and the best estimate is that they may be as much as a million degrees Celsius, or 1.8 million Fahrenheit. By comparison, the surface of our sun is a frigid wasteland, not quite nudging 10,000 Fahrenheit. To get hotter than these celestial filaments, you have to hang out in the cores of stars -- our sun's center is about 27 million degrees Fahreneheit.\n\nDespite their size, the filaments are difficult to \"see,\" because the radiation they give off is washed out by the immense amounts of the same radiation given off by the galaxies and galaxy clusters. So to recap -- galaxy clusters are irregular clumps that are connected by immense, superhot streams of gas that are very difficult to see clearly because of the emissions of the clusters themselves."}
{"text": "With a traditional optical telescope, the space between stars and galaxies (the background) is completely dark. However, a sufficiently sensitive radio telescope shows a faint background glow, almost exactly the same in all directions, that is not associated with any star, galaxy, or other object. This glow is strongest in the microwave region of the radio spectrum. The CMB's serendipitous discovery in 1964 by American radio astronomers Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson[2] was the culmination of work initiated in the 1940s, and earned them the 1978 Nobel Prize.\n\nCosmic background radiation is well explained as radiation left over from an early stage in the development of the universe, and its discovery is considered a landmark test of the Big Bang model of the universe. When the universe was young, before the formation of stars and planets, it was smaller, much hotter, and filled with a uniform glow from its white-hot fog of hydrogen plasma. As the universe expanded, both the plasma and the radiation filling it grew cooler. When the universe cooled enough, protons and electrons could form neutral atoms. These atoms could no longer absorb the thermal radiation, and the universe became transparent instead of being an opaque fog. Cosmologists refer to the time period when neutral atoms first formed as the recombination epoch, and the event shortly after of photons starting to travel freely through space rather than constantly scattering with electrons and protons in plasma is referred to as photon decoupling. The photons that existed at the time of photon decoupling have been propagating ever since, though growing fainter and less energetic, since the expansion of space causes their wavelength to increase over time (and wavelength is inversely proportional to energy according to Planck's relation). This is the source for the alternate term relic radiation. The surface of last scattering refers to the set of points in space at the right distance from us so that we would just now be receiving photons originally emitted from those points at the time of photon decoupling.\n\nPrecise measurements of cosmic background radiation are critical to cosmology, since any proposed model of the universe must explain this radiation. The CMBR has a thermal black body spectrum at a temperature of 2.725 K,[3].\n\nThe glow is very nearly uniform in all directions, but the tiny remaining variations show a very specific pattern equal to that expected of a fairly uniformly distributed hot gas that has expanded to the current size of the universe. In particular, the spatial power spectrum (how much difference is observed versus how far apart the regions are on the sky) contains small anisotropies, or irregularities, which vary with the size of the region examined. They have been measured in detail, and match what would be expected if small thermal variations, generated by quantum fluctuations of matter in a very tiny space, had expanded to the size of the observable universe we see today. This is still a very active field of study, with scientists seeking both better data (for example, the Planck spacecraft) and better interpretations of the initial conditions of expansion"}
{"text": "What is star\n\nA star is a huge, shining ball that produces a large amount of energy in form of light and other forms. Stars are very far from us, thats why they look like twinkling points of light. Our sun is also a star. A lot of stars are like our sun. Some differ in mass, size, brightness and temperature.\n\nStars come in many sizes. Some of the stars have a radius of about 1,000 times that of the sun. The smallest stars are the neutron stars, some of which have a radius of only about 6 miles (10 kilometers). About 75 percent of all stars are members of a binary system, a pair of closely spaced stars that orbit each other. The sun is not a member of a binary system. However, its nearest known stellar neighbor, Proxima Centauri, is part of a multiple-star system that also includes Alpha Centauri A and Alpha Centauri B. Proxima Centauri is 4.2 light years far form sun.\n\nStars are grouped in huge structures called galaxies. Telescopes have revealed galaxies throughout the universe at distances of 12 billion to 16 billion light-years. Our sun is in a galaxy called the Milky Way that contains more than 100 billion stars. There are more than 100 billion galaxies in the universe, and the average number of stars per galaxy may be 100 billion.\n\nStars have life cycles. They born, pass through several phases, and finally die. The sun was born about 4.6 billion years ago and will remain much as it is for another 5 billion years. Then it will grow to become a red giant. Late in the sun's lifetime, it will cast off its outer layers. The remaining core, called a white dwarf, will slowly fade to become a black dwarf.\n\nOther stars will end their lives in different ways. Some will not go through a red giant stage. Instead, they will merely cool to become white dwarfs, then black dwarfs. A small percentage of stars will die in spectacular explosions called supernovae.\n\nBrightness of star seen from Earth depends on two factors:\n\nThe amount of light energy the star emits.\n\nThe distance from Earth to the star.\n\nA nearby star that is actually dim can appear brighter than a distant star that is really extremely brilliant. For example, Alpha Centauri A seems to be slightly brighter than a star known as Rigel. But Alpha Centauri A emits only 1/100,000 as much light energy as Rigel. Alpha Centauri A seems brighter because it is only 1/325 as far from Earth as Rigel is -- 4.4 light-years for Alpha Centauri A, 1,400 light-years for Rigel.\n\nThese characteristics are related to one another in a complex way. Color depends on surface temperature, and brightness depends on surface temperature and size. Mass affects the rate at which a star of a given size produces energy and so affects surface temperature. To make these relationships easier to understand, astronomers developed a graph called the Hertzsprung-Russell (H-R) diagram.\n\nSurface temperature\n\nThe surface temperature of a star is determined by the rate of energy production at the core and the radius of the star and is often estimated from the star's color index. It is normally given as the effective temperature, which is the temperature of an idealized black body that radiates its energy at the same luminosity per surface area as the star. The temperature in the core region of a star is several million kelvins. The stellar temperature determines the rate of energization or ionization of different elements, resulting in characteristic absorption lines in the spectrum. The surface temperature of a star, along with its visual absolute magnitude and absorption features, is used to classify a star.\n\nMassive main sequence stars can have surface temperatures of 50,000 K. Smaller stars such as the Sun have surface temperatures of a few thousand K. Red giants have relatively low surface temperatures of about 3,600 K, but they also have a high luminosity due to their large exterior surface area.\n\nWhy stars are of different colors\n\nColor of star is the color of light the star is emitting. A star can appear red, if it emits light more towards red part of visible band of electromagnetic spectrum, and can appear blue if it emits light more towards blue part of visible spectrum. Our sun emits light equally among all wavelengths of visible spectrum. That is why our sun appears white to us.\n\nColor of the star depends on its surface temperature.\n\nTo understand how the color of a star depends on its temperature, we have to understand the concept of blackbody. A blackbody is a theoretical object that absorbs all radiation fall upon it. As a result it gets heated by absorbing all radiation, and starts emitting electromagnetic radiation at every wavelength. A plot of intensity versus wavelength of electromagnetic radiation emitted by blackbody is called blackbody spectrum. Figure 1 shows an example of blackbody spectrum.\n\nFigure-1: Blackbody Spectrum\n\nFigure 1 can be understood using Wien's law, which states the following relationship:\n\n\u03bb =\n\n2.9 x 10-6\n\nT\n\nwhere \u03bb is wavelength of maximum blackbody emission and T is the temperature of blackbody (in Kelvin)\n\nAs we can see that the relationship between wavelength and temperature is inverse. This means that as temperature will increase, wavelength will decrease or vice versa. Now if we take a look at figure 1, we will get the same relationship. There are 2 blackbody plots in figure 1, A and B. Body A is at a temperature of 20,000 K and body B is at a temperature of 5,000 K. Curve for Blackbody A peaks at a shorter wavelength than curve for blackbody B (Wavelength is increasing from left to right in figure 1), and blackbody A is at higher temperature than blackbody B.\n\nUntil this point we have seen that temperature is inversely proportional to the wavelength at which maximum emission from blackbody occurs. But this is not the end of story. Consider the following equation:\n\nL = 4\u03c0R2\u03c3T4\n\nwhere L is the luminosity in J/s, 4\u03c0R2 is the surface area of the blackbody in m2, \u03c3 is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature of the blackbody in Kelvin\n\nFigure-2\n\nAbove equation is called Stefan-Boltzmann law and it describes relationship between luminosity, temperature and size of blackbody. In figure 2, there are 3 blackbodies. Body A and C are at same temperature. We can see that intensity peaks for body A and C are same (at same height along Y-axis), but these 2 blackbodies are at different temperatures. This doesn't seem possible at first, but Stefan-Boltzmann law explains this. According to Stefan-Boltzmann law, intensity of emitted radiation not only depends on temperature, but on size of blackbody too.\n\nNow consider blackbodies B and C in figure. Both are at same temperature, but intensity or brightness is different. According to Stefan-Boltzmann law, we can conclude that blackbody B is smaller than C.\n\nAnother thing that should be noted from Stefan-Boltzmann law is that effect of change in temperature is more on the intensity of emitted radiation than change in size.\n\nStars are also known to astronomers as blackbodies. So blackbody characteristics apply on stars as well. As we know that color of the blackbody is the color of the light it emits or light emitted in a particular part of visible spectrum (if light emitted is in red part of visible spectrum, then color will be red; if light emitted is in blue part of visible spectrum, then color will be blue), and since color of light is due to its wavelength, we can say that color of star depends on its temperature as wavelength is related to temperature (Wein's law).\n\nLuminosity or Magnitude\n\nLuminosity is the brightness of star - i.e. total light emitted by star. The scientific term for rate of energy emission is power, and power is measured in watts. But in case of stars, luminosity is not measured in watts. Luminosity of a star is measured in terms of the luminosity of the sun, which is called Solar Luminosity. Luminosity of sun is 3.82 * 1026 watts. For example, luminosity of Alpha Centauri A is about 1.3 times solar luminosity.\n\nMagnitude is basically a measure of star's brightness. In ancient times, when there were no modern astronomical instruments, astronomers classify stars by their brightness. This system is now called stellar magnitude scale. Ancient astronomers developed this system by watching sky after sun set. The first stars that appeared were classified as first magnitude stars, second stars that appeared are classified as second magnitude stars and so on, upto six magnitude stars. Stars with magnitude six were the faintest stars.\n\nModern astronomers further classified this magnitude scale into apparent magnitude and absolute magnitude. Apparent magnitude of a star is related to its brightness and absolute magnitude is related to its luminosity. Modern astronomers also extended magnitude scale to include negative and decimal numbers and faintest stars upto 26th magnitude.\n\nApparent magnitude:\n\nApparent magnitude is a measure of star's brightness, or how bright a star appears to human eye. But in modern days, astronomers do not depend on their eyes. They use modern instruments like telescopes, photometers etc. So we can say that apparent magnitude is a measure that how bright a star appears to viewer or observer.\n\nBrightness of a star depends on the distance of star, size of star and energy emitted by star. If 2 stars have same size, distance and emitting same amount of energy, then their brightness or apparent magnitude will be same. If 2 stars have different brightnesses and their size and distance are equal, then they will be emitting different amount of energy. If we know star's apparent magnitude and two out of three qualities(size, distance and amount of energy emitted), we can get idea about the remaining third quality.\n\nAbsolute magnitude:\n\nUnlike apparent magnitude, absolute magnitude does not depend on star's size or distance. Absolute magnitude is the measure of how bright a star actually is, or how much energy a star is emitting. Absolute magnitude does not provide any idea about star's radius or its distance. Absolute magnitude is also called luminosity.\n\nModern magnitude scale starts with the brightest object and goes to the faintest object. Apparent and absolute magnitudes of sun are -26.8 and 4.8 respectively.\n\nLuminosity is related to absolute magnitude in a simple way. A difference of 5 on the absolute magnitude scale corresponds to a factor of 100 on the luminosity scale. Thus, a star with an absolute magnitude of 2 is 100 times as luminous as a star with an absolute magnitude of 7. A star with an absolute magnitude of -3 is 100 times as luminous as a star whose absolute magnitude is 2 and 10,000 times as luminous as a star that has an absolute magnitude of 7.\n\nMagnitude is based on a numbering system invented by the Greek astronomer Hipparchus in about 125 B.C. Hipparchus numbered groups of stars according to their brightness as viewed from Earth. He called the brightest stars first magnitude stars, the next brightest second magnitude stars, and so on to sixth magnitude stars, the faintest visible stars.\n\nModern astronomers refer to a star's brightness as viewed from Earth as its apparent magnitude. But they have extended Hipparchus's system to describe the actual brightness of stars, for which they use the term absolute magnitude. For technical reasons, they define a star's absolute magnitude as what its apparent magnitude would be if it were 32.6 light-years from Earth.\n\nAstronomers have also extended the system of magnitude numbers to include stars brighter than first magnitude and dimmer than sixth magnitude. A star that is brighter than first magnitude has a magnitude less than 1. For example, the apparent magnitude of Rigel is 0.12. Extremely bright stars have magnitudes less than zero -- that is, their designations are negative numbers. The brightest star in the night sky is Sirius, with an apparent magnitude of -1.46. Rigel has an absolute magnitude of -8.1. According to astronomers' present understanding of stars, no star can have an absolute magnitude much brighter than -8. At the other end of the scale, the dimmest stars detected with telescopes have apparent magnitudes up to 28. In theory, no star could have an absolute magnitude much fainter than 16.\n\nSize\n\nAstronomers measure the size of stars in terms of the sun's radius. Alpha Centauri A, with a radius of 1.05 solar radii (the plural of radius), is almost exactly the same size as the sun. Rigel is much larger at 78 solar radii, and Antares has a huge size of 776 solar radii.\n\nA star's size and surface temperature determine its luminosity. Suppose two stars had the same temperature, but the first star had twice the radius of the second star. In this case, the first star would be four times as bright as the second star. Scientists say that luminosity is proportional to radius squared -- that is, multiplied by itself. Imagine that you wanted to compare the luminosities of two stars that had the same temperature but different radii. First, you would divide the radius of the larger star by the radius of the smaller star. Then, you would square your answer.\n\nNow, suppose two stars had the same radius but the first star's surface temperature -- measured in kelvins -- was twice that of the second star. In this example, the luminosity of the first star would be 16 times that of the second star. Luminosity is proportional to temperature to the fourth power. Imagine that you wanted to compare the luminosities of stars that had the same radius but different temperatures. First, you would divide the temperature of the warmer star by the temperature of the cooler star. Next, you would square the result. Then, you would square your answer again.\n\nMass\n\nMass of a star is measured in terms of the solar mass, which is the mass of the sun, which is 1.98 * 1030 kilograms. For example, we can say that mass of Alpha Centauri A is 1.08 solar masses, and mass of Rigel is 3.50 solar masses.\n\nStars that have similar masses can be different in size i.e; they can have different densities. Density is the amount of mass per unit of volume. For instance, the average density of the sun is 1,400 kilograms per cubic meter. Sirius B has almost exactly the same mass as the sun, but it is 90,000 times denser than sun. As a result, its radius is only about 1/50 of a solar radius."}

But only parts of the arms can be seen - gray segments indicate portions not yet detected. Other known spiral arm segments--including the Sun's own spur--are omitted for clarity. Credit: T. Dame\n\n(PhysOrg.com) -- Our Milky Way galaxy, like other spiral galaxies, has a disk with sweeping arms of stars, gas, and dust that curve around the galaxy like the arms of a huge pinwheel.\n\nThe Sun, Earth, and solar system are located in a spur of material that lies between two of the spiral arms, collectively orbiting around the galaxy about 25,000 light-years from its center. Because the Milky Way contains copious amounts of dust that blocks our optical views, it is extremely difficult to study the galaxy from our vantage point within the disk.\n\nThus the details of the spiral arms in our own galaxy are much less certain than is the structure of external spirals such as Andromeda, which is a few million light-years away but sits well above the plane of obscuring dust. Radio wavelengths can peer through the dust, however, and molecules like carbon monoxide that emit in the radio and concentrate in the galaxy's spiral arms are particularly good tracers of their structure.\n\nUsing a small 1.2-meter radio telescope on the roof of their science building in Cambridge, CfA astronomers Tom Dame and Pat Thaddeus used carbon monoxide emission to search for evidence of spiral arms in the most distant parts of the galaxy, and discovered a large new spiral arm peppered with dense concentrations of molecular gas. The CfA scientists suggest that the new spiral is the far end of the Scutum-Centaurus Arm, one of the two main spiral arms thought to originate from opposite ends of our galaxy's central bar (see figure). If their proposal is confirmed, it will demonstrate that the Milky Way has a striking symmetry, with the new arm being the ...\n\nThough the universe is chock full of spiral-shaped galaxies, no two look exactly the same.

{"text": "Astronomical distancesAstronomers use special equations and measuring methods to determine distances in the universe and our solar system. Calculations in meters or kilometers will always result in very large figures, for example the nearest galaxy is the Andromeda galaxy, which is located at a distance of 21 quintillion km (21.000.000.000.000.000.000 km) away. Such a large figure is difficult to comprehend, when expressed in lightyears, the distance is 2.2 million lightyears, which is much easier to read.\n\nA Lightyear. The speed of light is the universal maximum\nvelocity, approximately 300,000 km/second.\n\nTo comprehend how fast this is, just image that ifyou were to travel around the Earth at the speed of light, you would make 7.5 complete rotations in only one second.\n\nDistances in the universe are incredibly large, to make calculations easier distances are measured in lightyears. This is the distance traveled at the speed of light in one year, approximately 9.5 trillion kilometers (9,500,000,000,000 km).\n\nParallax. In astronomy the apparent shift in position of (nearby) stars against the background of more distant stars is used to determine the distance of a star. As a result of the motion of Earth in its orbit around the Sun, a star, observed from Earth, will shift against its background. This is called a parallax, which is the angle of shift and is measured in distance.\n\nBy measuring twice, with an interval of six months (exactly half an orbit around the Sun) the distance can be measured in arc seconds.\n\nA full circle is 360 degrees, one degree is subdivided in 60 minutes, and one minute is subdivided in 60 arc seconds, so a circle is divided into 1,296,000 arc seconds.\n\nThis is a standard measure, which is often used is the parsec, which is the distance were a star's parallax is equal to 1 arc second. This distance equals 3.26 lightyears, so approximately 31 trillion kilometer (31,000,000,000,000 km). A parsec also equals approximately 206,000 Astronomical Units.\n\nAstronomical Unit. Making calculations in lightyears within our own solar system is not that handy. These distances are too small, for examle the Sun is positioned only 8 lightminutes away from Earth.\nFor easy calculations within our solar system a much smaller unit is used: the Astronomical Unit or AU.\nThis is the average distance between the Earth and the Sun, about 150\nmillion km (150,000,000 km). Pluto for instance is placed at 40 AE from the Sun.\n\nOn the image below the position of a comet\nis indicated against the Sun and Earth.

That's thirty-six-thousand four-hundred weeks. Seven hundred years.\n\nBut the most impressive thing about it isn't its distance from us.

Open star clusters are located in the disk of the galaxy. This differs from globular clusters which have hundreds of stars clumped together and are located in the halo. All of these stars from the ET Cluster were created around the same time from the same particles. Therefore, these stars are relatively the same age. All of the stars within the cluster are young. We can tell that the stars are younger because they are blue. Also, we know they are younger because the stars are still so close together. Open clusters do not have enough gravity (unlike the densely packed globular clusters) and are therefore unable to hold all of its stars together for long periods of time.

{"text": "A supernova is a massive star that explodes. The explosion is a cataclysmic\nevent for a star, one that essentially ends its active (energy-generating) lifetime.\n\nSupernovas occur with stars that have masses more than five times that of our sun. As a result of their\nhuge gravitational fields, they develop extremely high pressures in their cores. This allows them\nto continue to generate energy by fusion even when their hydrogen supply has been depleted\n(remember that stars fuse hydrogen to produce helium plus huge amounts of energy). The fusion of helium produces even heavier elements and vast amounts of energy.\nThese fusion reactions continue until elements as heavy as iron are formed. It is thought\nthat fusion reactions involving iron result in the catastrophic collapse of the star's core. The outer layers of the massive star are violently blown off in a supernova explosion.\n\nFor several months, supernovas may shine 10 billion times more brightly than a normal\nstar. Supernovas are rare, occurring only about once per century in a galaxy the size of\nthe Milky Way.\n\nBlack holes are regions of space that exert incredibly powerful gravitational fields.\nAs a result, they act like gigantic cosmic vacuum cleaners that can suck in anything\nthat comes within their grasp including comets, planets, and even clouds of gas.\nNot even light can escape the intense gravitational pull of a black hole. As a result,\nthey remain black and invisible.\nWhen an object is pulled into a black hole it is crushed to infinite density and disappears forever.\n\nBlack holes are formed by the collapse of massive stars. These huge stars are\nable to maintain their normal size during most of their life time because the heat generated\nfrom thermonuclear reactions expands the star outwards and offsets the huge gravitational\npull. When the star expends its nuclear fuel, however, the star collapses under its\nhuge gravitational pull and a black hole is formed. To put the magnitude of\nthese forces into perspective, a\nstar the size of our sun, 864,950 miles ( 1,391,704 kilometers) in diameter, would have to shrink to less\nthan 1.9 miles ( 3.06 kilometers) to become a black hole!\n\nBlack holes often seem to be part of binary systems, where the black hole and a visible\nstar revolve around one another. The black hole, with its massive gravitational\nfield, pulls gas from the visible star into itself. When this happens the gas emits\nstrong X-rays which astronomers can detect.\n\nA neutron star is the core of a\nstar that remains after a supernova explosion. Neutron stars emit intense X-rays. A neutron star has a mass about equal to the sun, but has a diameter of\nonly about 10 miles (16 kilometers). Neutron stars have a density estimated\nto be about 100 million tons per cubic inch (5.5 million metric tons per cubic centimeter). At this\nhigh pressure electrons and protons combine to form the neutrons of which the star is composed.\nThe temperature of the core is as high as 10 billion degrees F and the surface temperature can be 18 million degrees F.\n\nPulsar is an abbreviation for \"pulsating radio star.\" This name was given for the obvious reason that they emit extremely regular pulses of radio waves. Some pulsars, however, emit visible light, X rays, or gamma rays.\nPulsars are thought to be rapidly spinning neutron stars that are extremely dense (a neutron star is the core of a star that remains after a supernova explosion). Most pulsars have a diameter of 6 miles (10 kilometers) or less.\n\nA pulsar behaves much like a lighthouse beacon when it emits electromagnetic radiation (radio waves, visible light, X-rays, or gamma rays). Scientists believe that charged particles (protons and electrons) released from the surface enter an intense magnetic field that surrounds the star and rotates along with it.\nThe particles give\noff electromagnet radiation as they are accelerated to near the speed of light. Hence the pulsar swings\nan electromagnetic radiation beam around the star much like a beacon. Scientists are able to detect this pulsating radiation.\n\nThe interval between pulses ranges from about 4 seconds, for the slowest, to about\n1.55 milliseconds for the fastest (the Millisecond Pulsar). It has been estimated that the Millisecond Pulsar\nis spinning at 642 times per second! Scientists believe that this is near the limit of rotation, because\nat faster speeds the pulsar would rip apart as a result of centrifugal force at the equator.\n\nQuasars, or quasi-stellar radio sources, are believed to be\nthe highly luminous cores, or nuclei, of distant galaxies. The most baffling property\nof quasars is the vast amount of energy that they produce. Many are\nare up to a thousand times as bright as an average galaxy.\n\nCalculations have indicated that many quasars are receding at greater than 90%\nof the speed of light and that their distance from the Earth is enormous. Some are estimated to\nbe 14 billion light-years away. This incredible distance makes them the most distant objects\nknown and they probably mark the horizon of the known universe.\n\nQuasars are estimated to be only one or two light-years in\ndiameter. This is surprising because they emit 10 to\n1,000 times more electromagnetic radiation than a normal galaxy which\ncan have a diameter of greater than 100,000 light years.\n\nGalaxies are enormous cluster of stars. Small galaxies may contain\nfewer than a million stars while very large galaxies may contain more than\none trillion stars. Galaxies can be up to 100,000 light-years in\ndiameter.\n\nGalaxies come in four general shapes: 1) elliptical, 2)spiral, 3) barred spiral\nand 4) irregular. Elliptical galaxies show very little structure and are flat to spherical in shape. Spiral galaxies are flat and generally have a bright nucleus, and arms that come out of the nucleus and form a giant pinwheel shape. Barred spiral galaxies are also flat and have arms that extend sideways in a short straight line before curving into a spiral shape. Irregular galaxies are usually small and have no particular shape.\n\nThe Milky Way is our Galaxy. Some astronomers estimate\nthat the Milky Way has more than 100 billion stars. The Milky Way\nis a member of a group of about 20 galaxies know as the Local Group. Farther out, there are estimated to be\nbillions of other galaxies (sometimes called the extragalactic nebulae).\n\nThe stars that occur in the Milky Way are classified as Population I stars or Population II stars.\nPopulation I stars occur primarily in the spiral arms of the galaxy and include stars ranging in age from a few hundred thousand to 10 billion years old. Population I stars are rich in heavy elements (elements heavier than helium). Population II stars occur\nprimarily in the area around the galactic nucleus. Population II stars are approximately\n12 to 15 billion years old and are very deficient in heavy elements. These stars\nare the oldest members of our galaxy.\n\nNow for some speculation. The earth and the life that occupies the planet are composed of numerous elements that are heavier than helium. It is indeed an interesting thought that the atoms that\nmake up our bodies were forged in the core of distant stars and distributed throughout\nthe galaxy by massive supernova explosions. Since Population I stars are rich\nin heavy elements, it is these stars that have the highest probability of harboring\nplanets and life. Hence, if other life is to be found in the Milky Way, the greatest\nprobability would be in the spiral arms and not in the galactic core.\n\nComets are characterized by a brilliant nucleus surrounded by a\nfuzzy coma of light. From the coma extends a less luminous tail.\nThe nucleus, or core, of a comet has a composition resembling a large, dirty snowball.\nThey are thought to consist of approximately 25 percent dust and/or chunks of rock and about 75 percent ice. The ice consists primarily of frozen water,\nwith smaller amounts of methane, ammonia, and carbon\ndioxide radicals.\n\nSo far approximately 850 comets have been recorded. The nucleus of comets range in size from about 0.3 mile (0.5 kilometer) in diameter up to 42 miles (88 kilometers) in diameter. The tail, however, can be up to\nto 93 million miles (150 million kilometers) long. The tail of a comet always faces away from the sun\nas a result of the solar wind.\n\nWhen a comet approaches the sun its ice\nbegins to sublime (i.e. it passes from a solid to a gas form).\nThe sublimed gas also contains dust particles. The\ngas and dust spread out around the nucleus to form a large, thin atmosphere\nthat is called the coma. Sunlight causes the gas atoms in the coma to glow. The\namount of gasses present in the coma determine how bright the comet will be.\n\nAstronomers refer to comets as short-period comets or long-period comets. Short-period comets have orbital periods of less than 200 years and are usually members of the inner solar system. Long-period comets, on the other hand, can have periods on the order of millions of years and may have orbits that extend halfway to the nearest stars.\n\nStars are gigantic globes of incandescent gases (primarily hydrogen). They are\npowered by thermonuclear fusion which is the process of combining two light elements to form a heavier element plus large amounts of energy.\n\nThe brightness of a\nstar depends upon its size and temperature. Astronomers refer to the brightness\nof a star as its magnitude. Magnitude is defined in two ways, the apparent magnitude and the absolute magnitude. Apparent magnitude refers to how bright the star appears from Earth . Absolute magnitude is the value its apparent magnitude would be if the star were a distance of 10 parsecs (a parsec is equal to 3.26 light years) from Earth.\nStars can range in size from one tenth the size of our sun to more than 100 times as large.\n\nThe most common variety of stars include 1) giants and supergiants, 2) main sequence stars, and 3) white dwarfs. Giants and supergiants are generally yellow or red in color. These are very large stars that\nradiate huge amounts of energy but are generally cooler than our sun. Main sequence stars make up the majority of stars that we observe. These stars tend to radiate energy that is proportional to their surface\ntemperature. Hence, hot main sequence stars emit much more energy that cooler main sequence stars.\nWhite dwarf stars are very small in size. They are white in color and they emit more energy per unit area\nof surface than our sun. However, the TOTAL energy output from a white dwarf is much lower than our sun as a result\nof their small size."}
{"text": "11. Jeans Theorem &amp Applications\n\nAstronomy 626: Spring 1997\n\nJeans theorem states that any function F = F(I_1,I_2,...),\nwhere the quantities I_i are integrals of motion, is a\nsolution of the time-independent collisionless Boltzmann Equation.\nHere this theorem is used to construct models of spherical\ngalaxies.\n\n11.1 Jeans Theorem\n\nRecall from Lecture 8 that an integral of\nmotion is any function I(r,v) of the phase-space\ncoordinates r and v such that\n\nd\n(1) -- I(r(t),v(t)) = 0\ndt\n\nalong all orbits (r(t), v(t) = dr/dt). In a\ntime-independent system the specific energy E = 0.5|v|^2 +\nPhi(r) is always an integral; in spherical systems the specific\nangular momentum J is another.\n\nJeans theorem states that any integral of the motion is a solution\nof the time-independent CBE. The proof is straightforward:\n\nwhere the first equality follows because I is an integral,\nthe second by the chain rule, and the third by substitution of the\nequations of motion. Moreover, any function F(r,v) which\ndepends on (r,v) only through one or more integrals of\nmotion,\n\n(3) F(r,v) = F(I_1(r,v),I_2(r,v), ...) ,\n\nis also a solution of the time-independent CBE (BT87, Chapter\n4.4). Jeans theorem is useful in constructing equilibrium models\nof stellar systems.\n\n11.2 Isotropic Models\n\nThe simplest use of the Jeans Theorem is the construction of\nisotropic models of spherical galaxies; in this case, the\ndistribution function f(r,v) = f(E) is a function of\nonly the specific energy E. In a self-consistent\nsystem, the gravitational field is related to the mass density by\nPoissons equation; adopting spherical coordinates, we have\n\n-2 d 2 d(Phi)\n(4) r -- (r ------) = 4 pi G rho(r) .\ndr dr\n\nIt's convenient to use the boundary condition Phi -&gt 0 as\nr -&gt infinity; then the escape energy is zero and all stars\nat radius r have energies between Phi(r) and\n0.\n\nThe mass density rho(r) is the integral of f(r,v)\nover all velocities; since the velocity distribution is isotropic,\nthis integral is\n\n/ v_e\n| 2\n(5) rho = 4 pi | dv v f(E(r,v)) ,\n|\n/ 0\n\nwhere v_e = sqrt(-2 Phi(r)) is the escape velocity at\nradius r. Using the definition of the binding energy to\nchange the integration variable gives\n\n/ 0\n| 1/2\n(6) rho = 4 pi | dE (2E - 2Phi) f(E) .\n|\n/ Phi\n\nFrom f to rho\n\nGiven any functional form for f(E) which is\nnon-negative for all E &lt 0, use either Eq. 5 or 6 to\ncalculate the function rho(Phi), and insert the result in Eq.\n4. This yields an ODE for Phi as a function of r:\n\n-2 d 2 d(Phi)\n(7) r -- (r ------) = 4 pi G rho(Phi) .\ndr dr\n\nOnce the solution Phi(r) is determined, the density profile\nis just rho(r) = rho(Phi(r)).\n\nThe Plummer model is perhaps the simplest example (BT87,\nChapter 4.4.3(a)). The distribution function has the form\n\n7/2\n{ F (-E) , E &lt 0 ,\n(8) f(E) = {\n{ 0 , E &gt 0 ,\n\nwhere F is a constant. Using Eq. 5 to get rho(Phi),\nEq. 7 becomes\n\n-2 d 2 d(Phi) 5\n(9) r -- (r ------) = K (-Phi) ,\ndr dr\n\nwhere K is another constant. The solution is a model\nwith the density profile\n\n3 -3 2 2 -5/2\n(10) rho(r) = --- M a (1 + r /a ) ,\n4pi\n\nwhere M is the total mass and a is a scale radius.\nThis model was originally devised to describe observations of star\nclusters. It is actually not a very good model for elliptical\ngalaxies; most of the mass lies within a nearly-constant-density core,\nand at large r the density falls off as r^-5, which\nis steeper than the density profiles of E galaxies.\n\nThe King models (King 1966) are based on a `lowered\nisothermal' distribution function,\n\nwhere rho_1 is a parameter with units of density,\nsigma is a parameter with units of velocity, and E_0\nis a parameter with units of energy. One more parameter is needed to\nconstruct a solution; this is the value of the potential at the\ncenter, Phi_0 = Phi(0). However, there is a degeneracy among\nthese four parameters, so these models actually form a three-parameter\nsequence. Two of the parameters effectively fix the total mass and\nradius of the model. The third parameter, which may be expressed as\nW_0 = (E_0 - Phi_0)/sigma^2, determines the form of the\ndensity profile. Models with W_0 = 3, for example, are\nalmost `all core', while for larger values of W_0 an extended\nenvelope is added surrounding the core.\n\nOther models derived by starting with a distribution function\ninclude the polytropes (where f is a power-law in\nE), and the `isothermal sphere' (velocities have a Maxwellian\ndistribution).\n\nFrom rho to f\n\nSuppose instead that the density profile rho(r)is known;\nthe goal is now to solve for the distribution function. Eq. 4 yields\nthe potential Phi(r), and inverting this function allows us\nto calculate rho(Phi). Eq. 6 relates rho(Phi) to\nthe distribution function; differentiating this equation by\nPhi yields the Abel integral equation\n\nApart from its application to specific problems, Eq. 13 illustrates\na general and important point: not all spherical density profiles\ncan be realized with physically meaningful isotropic distribution\nfunctions. If the integral in Eq. 13 is a decreasing function of\nE, the distribution function is negative, which is physically\nimpossible. For example, `hollow' models in which the density has a\nlocal minimum at the center can't be realized using isotropic\ndistribution functions.\n\nJaffe's model (Jaffe 1983) is one of a number which have\nbeen proposed as approximations to the density profiles of elliptical\ngalaxies. This model has the form\n\n1 -2 -2\n(14) rho(r) = --- M a r (r + a) ,\n4pi\n\nwhere again M is the total mass and a is a scale\nradius. The distribution function which generates this model may be\nexpressed in terms of Dawson's integral.\n\n11.3 Anisotropic Models\n\nIf the velocity distribution is not isotropic then f(r,v)\nis a function of E and the angular momentum J. Most\ninteresting are systems where f depends on the magnitude of\nJ but not on its direction. Eq. 5 is then replaced by a\ndouble integral:\n\nwhere eta is the angle between the velocity and radius\nvectors and J = |r v sin(eta)| is the magnitude of the\nangular momentum.\n\nProceeding by analogy with the isotropic case, one can pick a form\nfor f(E,J) and calculate the corresponding density profile;\nexamples include the `generalized polytropes' (power laws in\nE and J) as well as many more physically motivated\nmodels.\n\nLikewise, one may pick a rho(r) and find an anisotropic\ndistribution function. Because f(E,J) is a function of two\nvariables, there are an enormous number of possible anisotropic\ndistribution functions which produce a given density profile. One\nchoice are the Osipkov-Merritt models (Osipkov 1979, Merritt 1985),\nwhich assume that f = f(Q), where\n\n1 2 2 2\n(16) Q = Phi(r) + - v (1 + (r/r_a) sin (eta)) ,\n2\n\nand r_a is the anisotropy radius. For r &lt\nr_a the velocity distribution is approximately isotropic, while\nfor r &gt r_a it is increasingly anisotropic. At any given\nradius the distribution function is stratified on spheroidal shells in\nvelocity space.\n\nHomework\n\nDue date: 2/27/97\n\n11. Starting with Eq. 8, find the density rho(Phi) for\nthe Plummer model (hint: start with Eq. 5 and make the\nsubstitutionv^2 = -2 Phi cos^2(theta)).\n\n12. Insert your result for Prob. 11 into Eq. 7 to get a\ndifferential equation for Phi[r]. If you can, solve this\nequation with the boundary conditions (a) Phi = 0 at r =\ninfinity, and (b) d(Phi)/dr = 0 at r = 0. If\nyou don't know how to solve this equation, show that the Plummer model\npotential from Lecture 7 is a solution and\nexpress F and Phi(0) in terms of the scale radius\na and the total mass M; then use dimensional\nanalysis to check that F (-E)^(7/2) has units of phase-space\ndensity."}

{"text": "How are stars formed?\n\nUp Next\n\nHow are stars formed?\n\nIt's easy to see why so many world religions deify the sun. It powers life on Earth and holds our entire solar system together. Yet despite all its awe-inspiring brilliance, the sun's formation follows a specific pattern of cosmic happenstance.\n\nLike so many things in the universe, stars begin very small --When the protostar becomes hot enough (7 million kelvins), its hydrogen atoms begin to fuse, producing helium and an outflow of energy in the process. We call this atomic reaction nuclear fusion. However, the outward push of its fusion energy is still weaker than the inward pull of gravity at this point in the star's life. Think of it like a struggling business that still costs more to operate than it makes.\n\nMaterial continues to flow into the protostar, providing increased mass and heat. Finally, after millions of years, some of these struggling stars reach the tipping point. If enough mass (0.1 solar mass) collapses into the protostar, a bipolar flow occurs. Two massive gas jets erupt from the protstar and blast the remaining gas and dust clear away from its fiery surface.\n\nAt this point, the young star stabilizes and, like a business that finally becomes lucrative, it reaches the point where its output exceeds its intake. The outward pressure from hydrogen fusion now counteracts gravity's inward pull. It is now a main sequence star and will remains so until it burns through all its fuel.\n\nWhat is the life span of a star? It all depends on its mass. A star the size of our sun takes roughly 50 million years to reach main sequence and maintains that level for approximately 10 billion years [source: NASA]. Astronomers classify the sun as a g-type main sequence star -- the \"g\" indicates the sun's temperature and color.\n\nLarger, brighter stars burn out far faster, however. Wolf-Rayet stars boast masses at least 20 times that of the sun and burn 4.5 times as hot, yet go supernova within a few million years of reaching main sequence [source: NASA].\n\nExplore the links on the next page to learn even more about life and death in the cosmos."}

{"text": "Newly Born Twin Stars are Far From Identical News story originally written on June 18, 2008\n\nAstronomers have always thought that twin stars, which are stars that have the same mass and orbit around each other, are identical. So they were surprised when they discovered that twin stars in the Orion Nebula were not identical at all. These stars actually have major differences in their brightness, surface temperature, and possibly even their size.\n\nThe newly formed twin stars are about 1 million years old. Since their full life span is about 50 billion years, they are equal to one-day-old human babies.\n\n\"The easiest way to explain the observed differences is if one star was fully formed about 500,000 years before its twin. That would be equivalent to a human birth-order difference of about half a day,\" said Keivan Stassun, one of the scientists who worked on this project"}

Follow @universetoday on Twitter\n\nTrue color of the Sun\n\nAstronomers collect the stars in the Universe into a classification system that organized them by color and spectral signature (the presence of various metals in the star's outer atmosphere). Here are the classifications: O, B, A, F, G, K, M (if you need to remember then, just keep this in mind: \"Oh be a fine girl, kiss me\".) G stars are perhaps the best known stars out there. That's because our own Sun is a G star.\n\nG stars range in temperature from 5,000 Kelvin to 6,000 Kelvin, and they appear white or yellow-white to our eyes. You can also recognize a G star by the presence of Calcium in their spectral signature, but with weaker hydrogen lines than F type stars. G stars represent 7.7% of all the stars in our stellar neighbourhood."}
{"text": "Chandra Observatory Shows Milky Way Enveloped in Gas\n\n\"The mass of the Milky Way gas envelope is comparable to the combined mass of the rest of the galaxy and, if confirmed, could explain the \"missing baryon\" problem in physics.\"\n\nAstronomers at NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory have found evidence that the entire Milky Way Galaxy is surrounded by a sheath of hot gas extending for hundreds of thousands of light years in all directions. The mass of this envelope is comparable to the combined mass of the rest of the galaxy and, if confirmed, could explain the \"missing baryon\" problem in physics.\n\nBaryons are the sub-atomic particles, comprised of quarks, that make up about 99.9% of the mass of the universe. Notable examples of baryons are protons and neutrons, which in turn are the most common baryons. Electrons are not formed from quarks, and as such are made up of leptons instead of baryons. Observations of extremely distant galaxies and gas halos show that scientists cannot account for about half the baryons observed in those far-off objects in our own time period.\n\nA recent study by five astronomers used information from Chandra, the European Space Agency's XMM-Newton space observatory, and Japan's Suzaku satellite to measure the temperature and size of the halo of gas. By measuring the X-rays absorbed by sources located hundreds of millions of light years from the galaxy, they were able to determine that the temperature of the gas surrounding the galaxy clocks in somewhere between 1 and 2.5 million kelvins, several hundred times hotter than the surface of our sun. This is much hotter than earlier measurements of the gas surrounding the galaxy, and this evidence points toward the conclusion that the gas halo is much more massive than previously thought.\n\n\"According to these measurements, the mass of the gas could be greater than that of more than 10 billion suns, or could even reach a mass as large as 60 billion suns.\" farther into the surrounding local group of galaxies. Either way, its mass appears to be very large.\"\n\nAccording to these measurements, the mass of the gas could be greater than that of more than 10 billion suns, or could even reach a mass as large as 60 billion suns. This uncertainty depends on certain factors that are not yet measured, such as the amount of oxygen relative to hydrogen, the most common element in the gas cloud. The estimated density of this cloud is very low, however, which is why it had escaped detection until relatively recently.\n\nFor more on NASA's findings on the Milky Way, head over to their website.\n\nThomas Anderson\n\nThomas spends most of his day reading and complaining about people he sees on the Internet.

{"text": "Giant Stars Bare Their Whirling Hearts\n\nA giant disguise. Although the surface of a cool giant star usually rotates slowly, its core\u2014shown here as white and blue\u2014spins fast.\n\nCredit: Paul G. Beck/Leuven University, Belgium\n\nBeauty can be just skin deep. So can stellar spin. Cool giant stars usually have surfaces that rotate slowly, but now NASA's Kepler spacecraft has revealed that their cores spin far faster. By stirring up a star's interior, rapid rotation can affect how a star lives and dies. Furthermore, because our sun will one day become a giant, the discovery provides insight into its future.\n\nToday, our sun is a main-sequence star, converting hydrogen into helium at its core. When the core runs out of hydrogen, 6.4 billion years from now, the element will begin burning in a layer around the core, making the sun expand, brighten, and cool until it becomes a yellow giant, then an orange giant, and finally a red giant. Giants are rare, accounting for less than 1% of all stars, but because of their brilliance\u2014they typically emit 100 times more light than our sun\u2014they make quite a splash in the night. The fourth brightest nighttime star, named Arcturus, is an orange giant, and the sixth brightest, Capella, consists of a pair of yellow giants.\n\nAstronomers measure how fast a star's surface spins by exploiting the Doppler shift. One side of a star spins toward us, producing a blueshift, while the other side spins away, producing a redshift. That means every spectral line gets smeared out, and the broader the spectral lines, the faster the spin. Such observations show that the surfaces of most yellow, orange, and red giants rotate slowly\u2014but the observations say nothing about what's happening beneath the surface.\n\nNow Paul Beck of the Catholic University of Leuven in Belgium and his colleagues have used data from the Kepler space observatory to study the cores of three yellow giant stars named KIC 5356201, KIC 8366239, and KIC 12008916. The stars are only 20% to 50% more massive than the sun, but they're about five times larger and 800\u00b0 to 950\u00b0C cooler.\n\nKepler monitors tiny dips in starlight that occur when planets pass in front of their stars. But vibrations running through a star also cause starlight to vary. Just as seismologists employ earthquakes to probe our planet's mantle and core, so astronomers use these so-called asteroseismological vibrations to study stellar interiors. From more than a year's worth of Kepler data, Beck and his colleagues report online today in Nature that the cores of all three giant stars spin at least 10 times faster than their surfaces.\n\n\"This is really a beautiful result,\" says astronomer Marc Pinsonneault of Ohio State University in Columbus, noting the frustration astronomers face in being unable to observe something as crucial as a star's internal spin. \"It's been a terrible problem: We know that rotation is important, we know that it can change the lives of stars quite a bit, but we've had surprisingly little data on what the insides of stars are actually doing.\" Pinsonneault says the discovery suggests that when the sun becomes a giant, it will also have a fast-spinning core, which may affect how the sun sheds its outer atmosphere and transitions from a red giant to a white dwarf.\n\nBeck says that elementary physics can explain his finding. When a star's core runs out of hydrogen, it contracts. \"Similar to an ice skater who's doing a pirouette, when you pull your arms toward you, you start to spin faster,\" Beck says, and so the star's core spins up. Just the opposite happens to the star's surface: it expands, so it spins more slowly."}

According to the book of Genesis, God created the world in seven days, while science has many theories, one of which is the Big Bang theory. It suggests that the universe was once in an extremely hot and dense state that expanded rapidly which caused the young universe to cool and resulted in its present continuously expanding state. Over the years, scientists and researchers continue to analyze how the world we live in came to existence. And now, supercomputers are telling us their side of the story.\n\nPleiades, is one of the five most powerful supercomputers run by the federal government, and ranks 7th in the list of most powerful supercomputers in the world, providing the most realistic simulation so far of how the universe evolves.\n\nPleiades is a NASA supercomputer that uses the simulation code Bolshoi to show the distribution of dark matter, a substance that consists of enormous amount of gravity that doesn't interact with normal and cannot be directly observed, across a span of 1 billion light years. The supercomputer is housed in NASA's Ames Research Center at Moffett Field, California.\n\nBolshoi uses data gathered from NASA's highly successful Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) mission which measured the faint \"cosmic microwave background\" left over from the Big Bang to trace the eventual formation of large structures. The Bolshoi simulation traces how the largest galaxies and galaxy structures in the universe were formed billions of years ago. Collaboration with astrophysicists at New Mexico State University Las Cruces, New Mexico and the University of California High-Performance Astrocomputing Center (UC-HIPACC), Santa Cruz, California ran the Bolshoi code on Pleiades for 18 days, which consumed millions of hours of computer time, and generated enormous amounts of data.\n\n\"NASA installs systems like Pleiades, that are able to run single jobs that span tens of thousands of processors, to facilitate scientific discovery,\" said William Thigpen, systems and engineering branch chief in the NASA Advanced Supercomputing (NAS) Division at NASA's Ames Research Center. \"The Bolshoi simulation is an excellent example of work done in support of NASA's science goal to understand how stars, galaxies and planets are formed, in order to get a picture of how the universe has changed over billions of years,\" Thigpen added.\n\nPleiades' new graphics processing units came from NVIDIA, Corp. and this greatly sped up parts of the Bolshoi calculations.\n\n\"Being able to tap into the power and speed of Pleiades has improved the Bolshoi simulation in every respect,\" said Joel Primack, director of the University of California High-Performance AstroComputing Center (UC-HIPACC) and co-investigator on two studies reporting on the simulation results, slated for publication in the Astrophysical Journal in October. \"In addition, ultra-high-resolution images and animations created by NAS visualization experts have provided the basis for imaging and interpreting our latest simulation results,\" Primack said"}
{"text": "Related\n\nKalirai: The main goal of my research is to understand the details of how stars like our sun, including those that are a little more and a little less massive, change over time. For billions of years, these stars will remain at the same brightness and temperature. This is great for humans on Earth since it gives us a stable climate. After the hydrogen in the sun is exhausted, the sun will become a stellar cinder and simply cool over time. We call this state, the end state of 98% of all stars, white dwarfs.\n\nAll of the action in stellar evolution occurs between these two phases, when, over a relatively short time scale, stars swell up into \"giants\" and spill their outer materials into space. The detailed understanding of this process, of how stars dramatically change, is fundamentally important to many research areas in astronomy. After all, the light that we see from distant galaxies is really just millions of individual stars at the tip of their luminous evolution.\n\nCNN: If the sun will experience this dramatic change, what is the fate of our planet Earth?\n\nKalirai: The Earth is orbiting the sun at a distance of about 90 million miles. When the sun runs out of hydrogen in its core, it will begin burning hydrogen in a shell around the core and become very luminous and bloated. The outer layers of the sun will actually reach the Earth, and so the oceans will evaporate and our planet will be fried. Sorry! Fortunately for us, this won't happen for several billions of years.\n\nBased on my research on \"stellar mass loss,\" the sun itself will lose about 45% of its mass through this process. The remaining mass, the core of the sun, will be the white dwarf. Interestingly, the size of that core will only be a little larger than the Earth, so the remnant star will be very dense.\n\nCNN: What telescopes do you use to study the stars?\n\nKalirai: I enjoy using the Keck telescopes on Mauna Kea in Hawaii. Over the past seven years, I've traveled to Hawaii to collect data from these telescopes more than a dozen times. The Keck telescopes are two of the biggest optical telescopes we have on Earth. The mirrors stretch over 30 feet across and the building itself is bigger than a house.\n\nThe site of the telescopes is also beautiful. Mauna Kea is a dormant volcano, and the telescopes sit at the peak, at the distance of 13,000 feet. It's a harsh environment to observe from since there is about 40% less oxygen at that altitude than sea level.\n\nCNN: You recently received an award from the American Astronomical Society called the 2013 Newton Lacy Pierce Prize.

Rejkuba et al.\n\nJanuary 10, 2008 A dramatic new Chandra image of the nearby galaxy Centaurus A provides one of the best views to date of the effects of an active supermassive black hole. Opposing jets of high-energy particles can be seen extending to the outer reaches of the galaxy, and numerous smaller black holes in binary star systems are also visible.\n\nThe image was made from an ultra-deep look at the galaxy Centaurus A, equivalent to more than 7 days of continuous observations. Centaurus A is the nearest galaxy to Earth that contains a supermassive black hole actively powering a jet.\n\nA prominent X-ray jet extending for 13,000 light-years points to the upper left in the image, with a shorter \"counterjet\" aimed in the opposite direction. Astronomers think that such jets are important vehicles for transporting energy from the black hole to the much larger dimensions of a galaxy, and affecting the rate at which stars form there.\n\nThis image shows a composite of a radio and an optical image of Centaurus A.\n\nPhoto by NASA/CXC/CfA/R. Kraft et al./ESO/VLT/ISAAC/M. Rejkuba et al\n\nThe inner part of the X-ray jet close to the black hole is dominated by these knots of X-ray emission, which probably come from shock waves, akin to sonic booms, caused by the jet. Farther from the black hole there is more diffuse X-ray emission in the jet. The cause of particle acceleration in this part of the jet is unknown.\n\nHundreds of point-like sources are also seen in the Chandra image. Many of these are X-ray binaries that contain a stellar-mass black hole and a companion star in orbit around one another. Determining the population and properties of these black holes should help scientists better understand the evolution of massive stars and the formation of black holes.\n\nAnother surprise was the detection of two particularly bright X-ray binaries. These sources may contain stellar mass black holes that are unusually massive, and this Chandra observation might have caught them gobbling up material at a high rate"}

Though the cavities contain very little hot gas, they are filled with a two-sided, elongated, magnetized bubble of extremely high-energy electrons that emit radio waves.\n\nThe cavities appear on opposite sides of a large galaxy at the center of the cluster, which indicates that a gigantic eruption produced by the galaxy's supermassive black hole created the structures. The magnitude of the eruption suggests that as a large amount of gas swirled rapidly toward the central black hole, it generated intense electromagnetic fields that ejected a fraction of the gas in the form of powerful jets of high-energy particles.\n\nAs these jets blasted through the galaxy into the surrounding, multimillion-degree intergalactic gas, they pushed the hot gas aside to create the cavities. The mass of the displaced gas equals about a trillion suns, more than the mass of all the stars in the Milky Way.\n\nChandra has discovered evidence of similar outbursts in the form of other X-ray cavities in galaxy clusters, but the cavities in MS 0735 are easily the largest and most powerful seen to date. To create such an enormous eruption, the supermassive black hole must have swallowed about 300 million solar masses of gas over the last hundred million years."}
{"text": "Like so many things in the cosmos, some stars practically die a-borning. These \"failed stars\" are known as \"brown dwarfs,\" and are simply not large enough to sustain a long-term hydrogenfusion reaction.\n\nBefore now, scientists believed the minimum mass required to sustain a long-term hydrogen reaction is equal to that of 75 times that of Jupiter. Although Jupiter's chemical makeup is almost identical to that of a star, it's mass is far too small to even begin a hydrogen reaction. As far as brown dwarfs are concerned, it has been difficult to confirm theories because brown dwarfs look a lot like red dwarfs - which are able to sustain the reaction required for full \"starhood.\"\n\nHarvey Richer of the University of British Columbia has used Hubble to observe the faintest red dwarf stars yet observed. These are located in a very old cluster identified as NGC 6397, about 8500 light years away. At 13.5 billion years, this cluster dates back to the beginning of the universe. According to another team member, Jay Anderson of Rice University in Texas, \"...the brown dwarfs have by now faded off into obscurity so there is a\nvery stark contrast between the stars that could burn hydrogen and the\nones that couldn't.\"\n\nTheories predict that the low-end mass for true stars should be determined by how many metals are present. Stellar objects with a metal content similar our own sun would need a minimum mass no less than 7.5% that of Sol. The NGC 6397 cluster has a metallic content that is less than 1% of the Sun's, so this dividing line is expected to be slightly greater - 8.3% that of Sol, or 83 times the mass of Jupiter.\n\nThe new Hubble observations are able to identify starts 10 to 20 times fainter than earlier ones. \"This kind of observation is probably the best kind of constraint one\ncan get,\" says Gibor Basri of UC Berkeley. He added that the hydrogen burning limits observed so far are in line with current theory."}
{"text": "Hypervelocity stars\n\nHypervelocity star\n\nHypervelocity stars (HVSs) are stars with a velocity so great, that they are able to escape the gravitational pull of the galaxy. Hence also the name Exiled Stars. Ordinary stars in the galaxy have velocities on the order of 100 km/s, while hypervelocity stars (especially near the center of the galaxy, which is where most are \"produced\"), have velocities on the order of 1000 km/s.\n\nObservational evidence\n\nHVSs were first theorized by J. Hills in 1988. Currently, ten HVSs are known. One of them possibly originated from the Large Magellanic Cloud, and was discovered by H. Edelmann et al. Warren Brown et al. from the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics discovered the first one in 2005. In 2006 and 2007 seven more were discovered by Warren Brown et al. All of the stars are over 50,000 parsecs away and unbound to the galaxy.\n\nNumber of hypervelocity stars in the Milky Way\n\nIt is believed that about 1000 HVSs exist in our Galaxy. Considering that there are around 100 billion stars in the Milky Way, this a minuscule fraction.\n\nProduction method\n\nHVS ejection mechanism\n\nThe main production method for HVSs is summarized as thus: they are believed to originate by close encounters of binary stars with the supermassive black hole in the centre of the Milky Way. One of the two partners is captured by the black hole, while the other escapes with high velocity. Also, it is worth noting that \"captured\" does not necessarily mean \"swallowed,\" for in all likelihood the companion to the HVS will never fall into the black hole.\n\nKnown HVSs are main sequence stars with masses a few times that of the Sun.\n\nAsymmetric supernova\n\nSome neutron stars are inferred to be traveling with similar speeds, however they are unrelated to both HVSs and the HVS ejection mechanism. Neutron stars are the remnants of supernova explosions, and their extreme speeds are very likely the result of an asymmetric supernova explosion. The neutron star RX J0822-4300 , which was measured to move at a record speed of over 3 million miles per hour in 2007 by the Chandra X-ray Observatory, is thought to have been produced this way."}
{"text": "IceCube, the big high-energy neutrino experiment cleverly embedded into the ice at the South Pole, announced a very interesting result yesterday, following on an already interesting result from a few weeks ago, one that I failed to cover properly. They have seen the highest-energy neutrinos ever observed, ones that, unlike previously observed high-energy neutrinos, appear not to be generated by cosmic rays hitting the top of the atmosphere. Instead, they apparently come from new sources far out in space. And as such, it tentatively appears that they've opened up, as long anticipated, a new era in neutrino astronomy, in which high-energy neutrinos will be used to understand astrophysical phenomena!\n\nI don't understand certain details well enough yet to give you a careful explanation \u2014 that will probably come next week \u2014 but here's an early description (and expert readers are strongly encouraged to correct any errors.) Continue reading \u2192\n\nThis is hot off the stellar press: as NASA announced today (with cool pictures), a brilliant, long, and rather nearby GRB, or \"gamma-ray burster\", was observed on April 27th, initially by the Fermi and Swift satellites. Gamma-rays are just an old name for photons (i.e. particles of light) which have lots more energy (per photon) than the photons of visible light. And a GRB is a distant astronomical explosion that produces an enormously bright flare of these high-energy photons, typically for a short time (seconds or minutes), though this one lasted for hours. It is believed that a narrow jet of high-energy particles produced in a supernova (a powerful explosion of a star) is behind these flares, but they are still poorly understood and are under active study.\n\nEverything about last week's GRB is on the exceptional side. The most energetic photon detected had somewhat more energy than the photons produced in the decays of Higgs particles, a bit less than the energy of the photons that Fermi might be seeing from dark matter, and more than three times more energy than any GRB photon previously detected by Fermi. Its gamma rays were produced for many hours, setting another record. It lasted so long that several other types of telescopes were able to observe it, including those that look at visible light (it was even seen by an amateur astronomer), and those that look at radio waves (which are made from photons with vastly lower energy). And it was relatively close\u2026 well, relatively compared to most GRB's. It occured in a galaxy 3.6 billion light years away. Now that is still a good fraction of the distance across the visible part of our universe, but still, it puts this GRB in the top 5% as far as proximity to Earth.\n\nWith such a vast amount of data to work with, it seems very likely that astronomers will learn qualitatively new things about GRBs by studying this blast. In astronomy, it sometimes takes just one spectacular event to change the scientific landscape! The next phase of the process will involve directly detecting the lesser (but still intense) glow from the (presumed) supernova that produced the GRB flare. Stay tuned! It should be a matter of a week or so\u2026\n\nDark Matter, Dark Matter, Everywhere! It's in your shoes, it's in your coffee, it's in the stars and even in your favorite cheese\u2026 at least, it's widely believed to be wandering all about, mostly unnoticed. Still it's not quite as inscrutable as its reputation would lead you to believe. It's responsible for a galactic glow, an abundance of anti-matter, and now \u2014 three quiet little taps in an underground mine.\n\nOr is it?\n\nApparent effects of dark matter have been \"discovered\" so many times in the last decade that you may by now feel a bit jaded, or at least dispassionate. Certainly I do. Some day, some year, one of these many hints may turn out to be the real thing. But of the current hints? We've got at least six, and they can't all be real, because they're not consistent with one other. It's certain that several of them are false alarms; and once you open that door a crack, you have to consider flinging it wide open, asking: why can't \"several\" be \"all six\"? All of the dark-matter search experiments are difficult, as they involve pushing the technological envelope. And as anyone with experience in science knows, most of the exciting-sounding results emerging from forefront experiments don't survive the test of time. Never underestimate the challenge of science at the frontier of knowledge!\n\n[UPDATE, midnight New York time: the cloud of particles from the solar flare arrived a few hours ago, but it didn't impact the earth's magnetic field quite as hard as the best-guess forecast. (Remember the probability of a geomagnetic storm was only 60%; i.e. the probability of no storm was 40%.) Right now, the auroras are likely visible in Canada but probably not in the US. This could change, but don't get your hopes up too high; we may have to wait for the next solar flare.]\n\nNow, many of you may have heard that there is a forecast of northern (and southern) lights, also known as auroras, tonight. What you've heard is correct: today's NOAA space-weather forecast, from  says\n\ni.e. it shows that even in mid-latitudes (meaning northern US and southern Canada, and northern Europe, along perhaps with parts of Australia and New Zealand [?]) they are estimating a 35%-45% probability of a minor `geomagnetic storm' tonight, with a 10-15% probability of a major storm\u2026 and a geomagnetic storm, which literally means a lot of activity in the earth's magnetic field, generally leads to auroras further away from the north and south pole than usual"}
{"text": "New Hubble Discovery May Help Explain The Formation Of Supermassive Black Holes\n\nIf you follow astronomy much, you've probably heard of the idea that our galaxy has an enormous black hole at the center of it. Sort of like a donut, if the hole in the middle swallowed up all light and deformed spacetime in the vicinity. (Come to think of it, I actually have eaten a few donuts like that\u2026) Our galaxy isn't alone in this feature, either; scientists believe that many galaxies sport one of these interstellar road hazards at their center. Aside from rendering the plot of Star Trek V even more nonsensical, this raises the question of how these supermassive black holes are formed. Now a new discovery by NASA's Hubble space telescope may help scientists understand this process, as well as providing a snapshot of the development in action.\n\nThe subject in question is a mid-sized black hole residing near \"the edge of the galaxy ESO 243-49, 290 million light-years from Earth.\" This is one of the first medium-sized black holes ever discovered, and scientists believe that it may have once served as the core of a small dwarf galaxy, one which has since slammed into ESO 243-49 (pictured above). That collision would have shredded and cannibalized the dwarf galaxy, stripping away its stars and leaving the black hole trapped on its outer edge. The idea is that the supermassive black holes are formed from collisions like this one, when smaller black holes impact and merge with each other.\n\nThe idea of this galactic fender-bender is supported by the observation of a cluster of young, blue stars, possibly less than 200 million years old, near the mid-sized black hole. These baby stars would have been formed by the impact of the two galaxies. Sean Farrell, of the Sydney Institute for Astronomy in Australia, explains:\n\nBefore this latest discovery we suspected that intermediate-mass black holes could exist, but now we understand where they may have come from. The fact that there seems to be a very young cluster of stars indicates that the intermediate-mass black hole may have originated as the central black hole in a very-low-mass dwarf galaxy. The dwarf galaxy might then have been swallowed by the more massive galaxy, just as happens in our Milky Way.\n\nTo give you a sense of scale, this \"mid-sized\" black hole \"has an estimated weight of about 20,000 solar masses.\" That's 20,000 times the mass of our own sun. To make your head swim even more, the black hole at the center of our galaxy is believed to have a mass of more than 4 million solar masses."}
{"text": "How Many Stars are there in the Universe?\n\nThis is one of those subjects on which people will disagree. Why? Simply because we can't actually count the exact number of stars in the universe. In fact, it is impossible to count the stars that make up our particular solar system. There is general agreement among astronomers that there are billions of stars in the universe, however.\n\nHuman beings began to wonder about this subject many centuries ago. Early astronomers first looked using their eyes then eventually got some help from basic telescopes. With their own calculations and with help from mathematicians the first scientists tried to come up with estimates. In past centuries it may have been easier to actually see more stars because there was less man-made light on the Earth to interfere. On very clear nights in rural areas today it is still possible to see more stars. Modern telescopes have brought many more stars into view.\n\nOne thing to keep in mind is that stars are grouped together in what we call galaxies. This makes it easier to see lots of stars. If they were widely scattered over the universe it would seem as if there were fewer stars. But with stars gathered in galaxies we can see millions upon millions of stars quite easily. The most recent estimates by astronomers (educated guesses) put the number of stars in our galaxy alone at 100 billion. (The galaxy that contains our sun and planets is called the Milky Way.) With billions of stars in each galaxy there are billions of billions of stars in the universe!\n\nOne of the most accurate methods for counting the stars in the universe is called mapping. Astronomers view a definite section of the sky and count the stars in that part, then multiply the number actually counted by the number of similar-size areas in the sky to get close to a total number. This is only a representative number, however. From this, astronomers try to estimate the number of galaxies in the universe and multiply that number by the star count in the Milky Way.\n\nIn recent years, the ability to put scientific instruments into space for a closer look has resulted in more accurate star counts. Not only that but satellites and cameras launched into space provide other information about stars. Scientists are even able to study the light levels of different stars and add stars to the count. Some of these stars were not visible before, even with the best telescopes.\n\nWhy is it important to know how many stars there are in the universe? It's not particularly crucial to the existence of life on Earth (at least not directly). But human beings have always been curious about what the universe is made of. We have always been intrigued about our place in the vast expanse of space. Counting the stars is one part of the overall knowledge human beings seek. For the Universe, the galaxies are our small representative volumes, and there are something like 1011 to 1012 stars in our galaxy, and there are perhaps something like 1011 or 1012 galaxies. So we can say that galaxies, on average have between 100 billion and 1 trillion numbers of stars."}
{"text": "M5\n\nMany of the stars in our region of the galaxy are fairly young -- from a few million to a few billion years old. Most of the really old stars congregate in what might be called stellar retirement centers. Their stars are as old as the galaxy itself -- up to 13 billion years.\n\nOne of these retirement centers is in the east on May evenings. Through binoculars, it looks like a fuzzy round blob of light, with a bright star-like core. But it's really a family of several hundred thousand stars -- a globular cluster known as M5.\n\nThe stars of M5 all formed from the same dense cloud of gas and dust when both the galaxy and the universe were quite young -- less than a billion years after the Big Bang. As the cluster aged, its heavier stars used up their nuclear fuel. The heaviest ones exploded, while lighter ones lost their outer layers, leaving behind only their small, faint cores. But stars that were no more massive than the Sun continued to shine on.\n\nToday, several hundred thousand of these stars are packed into a ball that's only about 150 light-years across. That means the stars are far closer together than they are in our own galactic neighborhood. So the night sky from a planet in M5 would be filled with stars -- the last members of a stellar retirement center.\n\nM5 is in the constellation Serpens Kaput -- the tail of the serpent. It's well up in the east a couple of hours after nightfall. You need binoculars and a starchart to find it"}
{"text": "NASA's Infrared Sky Comprised of 2.7 Million Images\n\nNASA recently unveiled a new atlas and catalog of the entire infrared sky, which includes more than a half billion stars, galaxies and other objects captured by the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) mission. It is comprised of more than 2.7 million images taken at four infrared wavelengths of light, capturing everything from nearby asteroids to distant galaxies.\n\nThe sky can be thought of as a sphere that surrounds us in three dimensions. To make a map of the sky, astronomers project it into two dimensions. The projection used in this image of the sky, called Aitoff, takes the 3D sky sphere and slices open one hemisphere, and then flattens the whole thing out into an oval shape.\n\nIn the mosaic, the Milky Way Galaxy runs horizontally across this map. The Milky Way is shaped like a disk and our solar system is located in that disk about two-thirds of the way out from the center.\n\nThree of the four wavelengths surveyed by WISE were used to create this image. The colors used in this image represent specific wavelengths of infrared light. Cyan (blue-green) represents light emitted predominantly from stars and galaxies, while green and red represent light mostly emitted by dust.\n\nWISE observations have led to numerous discoveries, including the elusive, coolest class of stars. Astronomers hunted for these failed stars, called \"Y-dwarfs,\" for more than a decade. Because they have been cooling since their formation, they don't shine in visible light and could not be spotted until WISE mapped the sky with its infrared vision."}

{"text": "Saturday, October 30, 2010\n\nIntroducing Some Basic Astrophysics\n\nLet's now start examining a number of basic problems typically posed in astrophysics. We'll start out with one of the most fundamental, the nature of \"gray atmospheres\" in stellar modelling. Stellar modelling itself is a topic that can occupy whole monographs (e.g. 'An Introduction to the Study of Stellar Structure' by S. Chandrasekhar) but we will confine current interest strictly to one simplified aspect of stellar atmospheres for now. (At a later point, we can examine how a full stellar model is developed from the interior to the outer envelope).\n\nModeling stellar atmospheres is similarly a very complex undertaking that often requires we make basic assumptions. The \"gray atmosphere\" is one such simplifying assumption.\n\nFirst, some preliminaries on essential technical terms, etc.\n\nThe Planck function describes the distribution of radiation for a black body, and can be expressed:\n\nB(L) = {(2 hc^2)/ L^5} * [1/ exp(hc/LkT) - 1)]\n\nwhere h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, T is the absolute temperature, k is the Boltzmann constant, and L defines the wavelength.In the plane-parallel treatment, we take layers of the gases in a stellar atmosphere to be like layers of a \"sandwich\", where ds is an element of length or path perpendicular to the layers\n\nThis is opposed to employing curved layers (as would technically be the case, but for which the math is many times more complex!)\n\nNow as a beam of radiation passes through stellar gases, there will be emission and absorption along the way. The \"source function\" specifies the ratio of one to the other and can be expressed:\n\nS(L) = e(L)/ k(L)\n\nwhere L again denotes wavelength, e(L) is the emission coefficent, and k(L) the absorption coefficient.\n\nIn the case of simple radiation transfer in a model stellar atmosphere (e.g. nothing changes with time), we have the relation of radiation intensity I(L) to source function S(L):\n\ndI(L)/ds = -k(L) I(L) + k(L) S(L) = k(L)[S(L) \u2013 I(L)] - 0\n\nor I(L) = S(L)\n\nNow, for a black body, I(L) equals the Planck function B(L)\n\nSo, in effect, we have:\n\nS(L) = I(L) = B(L)\n\nAnd this is a condition \u2013 which for any stellar atmosphere \u2013 implies LOCAL THERMODYNAMIC EQUILIBRIUMor LTE Note: LTE does NOT mean complete thermodynamic equilibrium!(E.g. since in the outer layers of a star there is always large energy loss from the stellar surface)\n\nThus, one only assumes the emission of the radiation is the same as for a gas in thermodynamic equilibrium at a temperature (T) corresponding to the temperature of the layer under consideration.\n\nAnother way to say this is that if LTE holds, the photons always emerge at all wavelengths.\n\nNow, in the above treatment, note that the absorption coefficient was always written as: k(L) to emphasize its wavelength (L) dependence.\n\nHowever, there are certain specific treatments for which we may eliminate the wavelength dependence on absorption, and simply write:ke.g. k has the same value at ALL wavelengths!\n\nThis is what is meant by the \"gray atmosphere\" approximation.\n\nI'll now give a specific application of the gray atmosphere approximation. In a particular integral, the surface flux\n\n(pi F(O)) = 2 pi (I(cos (theta)) =[a(L) + 2(b(L)/3 ] pi\n\nand F_L(0) = S(L) (t(L) = 2/3\n\nwhich states that the flux coming out of the stellar surface is equal to the source function at the optical depth t = 2/3. This is the important 'Eddington-Barbier' relation that paves the way for the understanding of how stellar spectra are formed.\n\nOnce one then assumes LTE, one can further assume k(L) is independent of L (gray atmosphere) so that:\n\nk(L) = k; t(L) = t andF_L(0) = B_L(T(t = 2/3)\n\nThus, the energy distribution of F_L is that of a black body corresponding to the temperature at an optical depth t = 2/3.\n\nFrom this, with some simple substitutions and integrations (hint: look at the Stefan-Boltzmann law!) the interested reader can easily determine:\n\npi F(O) = o(T_eff)^4 and T_eff = T(t = 2/3)\n\nwhere o is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Thus, the temperature at optical depth 2/3 must equal the effective temperature"}
{"text": "ScienceShot: Light From Beyond the Universe's Dark Side\n\nMost galaxies belong to large structures called superclusters (bright filaments seen in this simulation), which are separated by enormous voids (dark areas\nabove) that harbor few galaxies at all. A galaxy's gravity can magnify the light of objects beyond it, so logically voids should do the opposite, dimming\ngalaxies behind them. Now, however, new calculations in Physical Review Letters demonstrate \"the bright side of voids\": Because voids lack the gravitational pull\nof matter to restrain the universe's expansion, they expand faster than the overall cosmos, producing a Doppler shift that overwhelms the dimming and\ncauses objects on a void's far side to look a few percent brighter than they otherwise would. Voids occupy more than half of the universe's\nvolume, the researchers note, and should make some supernova explosions seem more powerful than they actually are.In fact, astronomers\nmay have already unknowingly detected this effect, because they've observed that the peak brightness of what should be uniformly luminous supernovae varies\nmore from explosion to explosion in isolated galaxies, which are more likely to lie on the edge of a void, than in galaxies residing in clusters."}

Stars do NOT rely on dust for fuel at all. Stars rely on GAS for fuel - initially, from the available intergalactic or interstellar medium which is always dominated by hydrogen and helium. You can't get a star to operate on any \"dust\".

{"text": "Hubble spots a bright spark in a nearby spiral galaxy\n\nJun 11, 2012Lying around 50 million light-years away, Messier 99 is one of over a thousand galaxies that make up the Virgo Cluster, the closest cluster of galaxies to us. Messier 99 itself is relatively bright and large, meaning it was one of the first galaxies to be discovered, way back in the 18th century. This earned it a place in Charles Messier's famous catalog of astronomical objects.\n\nIn recent years, a number of unexplained phenomena in Messier 99 have been studied by astronomers. Among these is the nature of one of the brighter stars visible in this image. Cataloged as PTF 10fqs, and visible as a yellow-orange star in the top-left corner of this image, it was first spotted by the Palomar Transient Facility, which scans the skies for sudden changes in brightness (or transient phenomena, to use astronomers' jargon). These can be caused by different kinds of event, including variable stars and supernova explosions.\n\nWhat is unusual about PTF 10fqs is that it has so far defied classification: it is brighter than a nova (a bright eruption on a star's surface), but fainter than a supernova (the explosion that marks the end of life for a large star). Scientists have offered a number of possible explanations, including the intriguing suggestion that it could have been caused by a giant planet plunging into its parent star.\n\nThis Hubble image was made in June 2010, during the period when the outburst was fading, so PTF 10fqs's location could be pinpointed with great precision. These measurements will allow other telescopes to home in on the star in future, even when the afterglow of the outburst has faded to nothing.\n\nA version of this image of Messier 99 was entered into the Hubble's Hidden Treasures Competition by contestant Matej Novak. Hidden Treasures is an initiative to invite astronomy enthusiasts to search the Hubble archive for stunning images that have never been seen by the general public.

{"text": "The oldest star yet discovered is HE 1523-0901, HE 1523-0901 is the designation given to a red giant star in the Milky Way galaxy approximately 7500 light years from Earth. It is thought to be a second generation Population II, or metal-poor, star ([Fe/H] = \u22122.95). The star was found in the sample of bright metal-poor halo stars from the Hamburg/ESO Survey by Anna Frebel and collaborators. The group's research was published in the May 10 2007 issue of The Astrophysical Journal. The star's age, as measured by ESO's Very Large Telescope, is 13.2 billion years. This makes it the oldest object yet discovered in the galaxy, and nearly as old as the estimated age of the universe itself (13.7 billion years as measured by WMAP). HE 1523-0901 is the first star whose age was determined using the decay of the radioactive elements uranium and thorium in tandem with measurements of several neutron capture elements. It is believed to have formed directly from the remnants of the first-generation stars that reached the end of their longevity and exploded as supernovae early in the history of known matter.\n\nFacts: The Northern Lights are discharged particles from the sun that comes in different colors.\n\nThe Northern Lights or Aurora Borealis are discharged particles from the sun that pass through the magnetic shield of earth and create light when they mix with atoms and molecules such as nitrogen and oxygen gases on entering into the earth's atmosphere. These particles travel 149 million kms or 93 million miles through space towards planet earth being drawn towards the earth's magnetic north and south polar regions. As the solar wind particles enter the earth's atmosphere they collide with molecules of nitrogen and oxygen which relinquish their agitated energy in the form of light. Oxygen typically produces green and yellow light while nitrogen produces reds, violets and occasionally blue. Violets typically form a boarder around curtains of green aurora shapes in lower altitudes.\n\nMany astronomers consider Saturn the most beautiful planet in the solar system Primarily because of its distinctive, amazing rings. In fact, Saturn's nickname is \"the jewel of the solar system.\" Most gas giants have rings made of dust and other particles, but they're typically hard to see and are not a prominent feature of the planets. Rings like the ones Saturn has, which are large and very visible through a telescope, are incredibly rare among planets in our galaxy. The solar system is an amazing place because it boasts not just the only known life-sustaining planet Earth, but also a beautiful gas giant like Saturn, which would likely be the first planet noticed by extraterrestrial life forms if they happened upon our system (gas giants are much easier to detect from distance than rocky planets like Earth).\n\nFact: The Earth gets 100 tons heavier every day due to falling space dust.\n\nThe earth is a closed system and as such does not gain or lose any weight. However, around 100 tons of space dust falls to earth every day, and when shuttles or satellites are launched, technically the earth is losing some weight from it. But this is negligible and as such should be disregarded. The most weight the earth has ever lost is when the moon was formed by a collision with another proto-planet.\n\nOn the first moon landing, US astronaut Alan Shepard swung a six iron four times. His first swing moved the ball less than a meter; his second swing missed and kicked up some dust. The third swing hit that same first ball about 200 yards - a slice. Then he dropped a second ball, and his fourth swing hit the ball about 400 yards.\n\nIf you've ever gazed at the night sky, you've probably wished upon a shooting star (which are really meteors). But shooting stars do exist, Hypervelocity stars (HVSs) and they're stars with a velocity so great that they are able toescapethe gravitational pull of the galaxy. They're extremely rare, currently, sixteen are known, one of which is believed to originate from the Large Magellanic Cloud rather than the Milky Way. All of the currently known HVSs are over 50,000 parsecs away and are unbound from the galaxy. It is believed that about 1000 HVSs exist in our Galaxy.Considering that there are around 100 billion stars in the Milky Way, this is a minuscule fraction (~0.000001%).\n\nThe existence of HVSs was first predicted in 1988,and their existence confirmed In 2005, astronomers discovered the first \"hypervelocity\" star careening out of a galaxy at nearly 530 miles per second (10 times faster than ordinary star movement). Ordinary stars in the galaxy have velocities on the order of 100 km/s, while hypervelocity stars (especially those near the center of the galaxy, which is where most are thought to be produced), have velocities on the order of 1000 km/s.\n\nWe have ideas about what flings these rare stars into deep space, but aren't certain; anything from off-kilter supernova explosions to supermassive black holes might be responsible.\n\nThe Sun, like most other astronomical objects (planets, asteroids, galaxies, etc.), rotates on its axis. Unlike Earth and other solid objects, the entire Sun doesn't rotate at the same rate. Because the Sun is not solid, but is instead a giant ball of gas and plasma, different parts of the Sun spin at different rates.\n\nWe can tell how quickly the surface of the Sun is rotating by observing the motion of structures, such as sunspots, on the Sun's visible surface. The regions of the Sun near its equator rotate once every 25 days. The Sun's rotation rate decreases with increasing latitude, so that its rotation rate is slowest near its poles. At its poles the Sun rotates once every 36 days!\n\nThe interior of the Sun does not spin the same way as does its surface. Scientists believe that the inner regions of the Sun, including the Sun's core and radiative zone, do rotate more like a solid body. The outer parts of the Sun, from the convective zone outward, rotate at different rates that vary with latitude. The boundary between the inner parts of the Sun that spin together as a whole and the outer parts that spin at different rates is called the \"tachocline\".\n\nThe behavior of the Sun's magnetic field is strongly influenced by the combination of convective currents, which bring the charged plasma from deep within the Sun to the Sun's surface, and the differential rotation of the outer layers of the Sun. The complex, swirling motions that result make a tangled mess of magnetic field lines at the Sun's surface. Differential rotation is apparently the main driver of the 11-year sunspot cycle and the associated 22-year solar cycle. The notion that differential rotation and convective motion drive these cycles was first put forth in 1961 by the American astronomer Horace Babcock, and is now known as the Babcock Model. seem to be seen. Since its discovery, at least three other similar asteroids have been discovered. These types of objects are also found in similar relationships to other planets in our Solar System.Travel INSIDE a Black Hole\n\n\"Black holes are the seductive dragons of the universe, outwardly quiescent yet violent at the heart, uncanny, hostile, primeval, emitting a negative radiance that draws all toward them, gobbling up all who come too close.

{"text": "Pulsars III\n\nMost stars, like the Sun, are made of different layers of hot gas. As the stars rotate, the layers spin at different rates. That tangles up a star's magnetic field, creating big magnetic storms on its surface. And when the field gets too tangled, it triggers powerful explosions.\n\nBut in a neutron star, the tangled magnetic fields can crack the star's solid crust, triggering outbursts that are far more powerful than those from any Sun-like star.\n\nNeutron stars are the crushed remnants of exploded stars. They're as massive as the Sun, but only a few miles in diameter. They're squeezed so tightly that they have a solid crust, with a \"liquid\" layer of pure neutrons below.\n\nSome neutron stars spin rapidly -- once every few seconds, or even faster. They \"beam\" energy into space from their magnetic poles. If Earth lies along the path of one of these beams, we see the star \"pulse\" on and off, like a lighthouse beacon sweeping across the cosmic landscape.\n\nOver time, these pulsars spin a little slower. But some of them can suddenly speed up again.\n\nThat's probably caused by the different spin rates of the solid crust and the liquid layer below. This generates extremely powerful magnetic fields. When the fields get tangled, they produce \"starquakes\" in the crust -- violent cracks that are accompanied by enormous bursts of energy.

It blasted its outer layers into space at a few percent of the speed of light. This material continues to expand into space as a giant shell.

These elements may someday be incorporated into new stars, planets, or even living organisms.\n\nThese elements were forged inside the star itself. Under the extreme temperatures and pressures in its core, lightweight elements \"fuse\" together to form heavier ones. The first step in this process fuses hydrogen to make helium -- the process that's taking place today in the Sun.\n\nAs stars age, they use up the hydrogen and start fusing the helium to make other elements. Stars like the Sun make carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen.\n\nThe heaviest stars make these elements, too. But the cores of these stars get much hotter, allowing them to make even heavier elements. And when they explode, they forge even more elements. So elements like iron, lead, uranium, and many others were manufactured in stars like the one that produced the supernova in Cassiopeia, then blasted into space in the stars' spectacular deaths"}

{"text": "When stars which have a Main Sequence lifetime which is less than the age of the Universe get old and die, they swell up to become red giants, or supergiants. In the process, their surface gravities become much lower, and the convective motions in their outer layers help drive a mass loss which can reduce their masses by a substantial amount during the last stages of their life.\nIf the giant star is a single star, as the Sun is, all that happens as a result of the mass loss is that it becomes less massive, and ends its red giant lifetime, and its life as a whole, a little sooner. But if it is a member of a binary star system, as a large number of stars are, then there can be a transfer of mass from the dying star to the other star, resulting in a number of interesting possibilities. When the other star is a Main Sequence star, the transfer of mass increases the weight compressing the core of the star, and as the core becomes denser and hotter, the nuclear reactions go faster and faster, producing an ever larger amount of heat, and making the star swell up to a larger, hotter, brighter structure which corresponds to the now larger mass which it has. In other words, it remains a Main Sequence star, but moves up the Main Sequence to a position corresponding to its new mass. This sort of thing must have happened to the star Sirius, which is the brightest star in our sky, other than the Sun, partly because it is one of the closest stars to our Sun, and partly because it is a little over twice the weight, and twenty times the brightness of the Sun. Such stars only last about two billion years as Main Sequence stars, but Sirius has a companion, Sirius B, which is a white dwarf about the same mass as the Sun. Since a star like the Sun can last for over ten billion years as a Main Sequence star, it is impossible for the less massive star to have already died, while the more massive star still lives. At one time, the star which is now less massive must have been the more massive one, and as it grew old, it swelled up, dumped material on its companion, and in the process, became a less massive star, while its companion became a more massive one. But suppose that the companion is not a Main Sequence star, but a white dwarf, the most common type of dead stellar object which we know of. In this case, as the dying star transfers material to the white dwarf, the nuclear reactions in its core will not go faster, because white dwarfs cannot have any nuclear reactions inside them. In a normal star, if nuclear reactions go a little too fast, the gas will heat up, increase its pressure, and expand, which will reduce the temperature, and damp down the nuclear reactions, forcing them back toward a value closer to the average heat loss of the core. If the nuclear reactions go too slowly, the gas will cool off, decrease its pressure, and contract, which will increase the temperature, and increase the nuclear reactions. In either case, the relationship between temperature and pressure which applies to normal gases will guarantee that the nuclear reactions cannot go too fast, or too slow, at least on the average. In the electron-degenerate material which makes up a white dwarf, however, pressure and temperature are not linked. If nuclear reactions go too fast, the temperature will rise, but the pressure will not be significantly changed, and the increase in temperature will simply make the nuclear reactions go faster and faster, until, as in a chain reaction, the region which contains nuclear fuel simply undergoes a catastrophic explosion. (Note: This is discussed in the text under such topics as the Helium Flash which occurs during the red giant lifetime of the Sun.) Because of this, it is not possible for a white dwarf to have any nuclear burning going on inside it. So, when new material is dumped onto the surface of the star by a companion, the mass of the star increases, and the pressure inside the star increases, but otherwise, nothing much happens, at least for a while. Over a long period of time, however, as more and more material is dumped onto the star, the pressures and temperatures within the electron-degenerate gas do begin to rise, and if they reach values where nuclear burning can begin, there will be an explosion of considerable violence.\nHow violent the explosion is depends upon the size and mass of the white dwarf. Since white dwarfs, unlike Main Sequence stars, are smaller the more massive they are, a white dwarf with a mass near, but not too near, the limit of mass for white dwarfs (the Chandrasekhar Limit) will be relatively small, and have a relatively large gravity. This means that material falling onto the star will very quickly reach high pressures and temperatures, and so little material will accumulate before an explosion occurs, and the explosion will be 'relatively' minor. This is believed to be the reason for so-called recurrent novae, such as RS Ophiuchi (shown below). Over a period of a few dozens to a few hundreds of years, material piles up on a massive white dwarf, then explodes, making the object millions of times brighter for a short while. After the explosion is over, more material has to accumulate before another explosion can take place, and so there will be another few decades or centuries before the nova recurs. (For white dwarfs with masses extremely close to the Chandrasekhar Limit, see the note following neutron stars, below.)\n\nArtist's conception of the recurrent nova RS Ophiuchi. The red giant on the right is continually dumping material onto the white dwarf on the left. Every twenty years or so, temperatures in the white dwarf's not-quite-degenerate envelope reach fusion values, and a runaway reaction causes a nova. Even though the system is two thousand light years from Earth, the novae can be seen with the unaided eye, in a dark sky. Over time, more and more mass will be shed by the red giant, and eventually -- perhaps a hundred thousand years or so from now -- the white dwarf may reach the Chandrasekhar Limit, and have a far more violent explosion -- a supernova that will blow it to bits.

The jet activity is also believed to regulate the growth of massive galaxies via the AGN feedback. In this project, through the use of numerical simulations, I explore the intrinsic and extrinsic physical properties of the population of Fanaroff-Riley II (FR II) objects, i.e. their kinetic luminosities, lifetimes, and central densities of their environments. This allows one to investigate evolution of these radio sources across cosmic time, and to discuss the significance of the impact of these sources on the evolving Universe."}
{"text": "Double Explosion\n\nA few years ago, a giant star in another galaxy blew its top. But that was just a prelude to the main act. A couple of years later, it blew itself to bits -- perhaps giving birth to a black hole.\n\nThe star is known as Supernova 2006jc. It was about 77 million light-years away, in the constellation Lynx. That means the fireworks actually took place 77 million years ago, but their light just recently reached Earth.\n\nThe saga of 2006jc began in late 2004, when a Japanese amateur astronomer noticed a bright outburst in the Lynx galaxy. Astronomers first thought it was a supernova -- an explosion that can outshine an entire galaxy of normal stars.\n\nJust two years later, though, the star produced an even brighter outburst. This time, it really was a supernova.\n\nAstronomers are still studying the star, but the most likely scenario is this.\n\nThe star was many times larger and more massive than the Sun. An eruption from its surface layers spewed enough material into space to make several thousand planets as massive as Earth.\n\nBut the star quickly reached the point where it could no longer produce energy in its core. It may have made particles of matter and antimatter. These particles annihilated each other, driving the explosion that ripped the star apart. At the same time, the star's core collapsed -- perhaps producing a black hole.\n\nThere's a similar star in our own galaxy, just a few thousand light-years away. More"}
{"text": "A supernova remnant (SNR)\n\nThere are two common routes to a supernova: either a massive star may run out of fuel, ceasing to generate fusion energy in its core, and collapsing inward under the force of its own gravity to form a neutron star or a black hole; or a white dwarf star may accumulate (accrete) material from a companion star until it reaches a critical mass and undergoes a thermonuclear explosion.\n\nIn either case, the resulting supernova explosion expels much or all of the stellar material with velocities as much as 10% the speed of light, that is, about 30,000 km/s. These ejecta are highly supersonic: assuming a typical temperature of the interstellar medium of 10,000 K, the Mach number can initially be > 1000. Therefore, a strong shock wave forms ahead of the ejecta, that heats the upstream plasma up to temperatures well above millions of K. The shock continuously slows down over time as it sweeps up the ambient medium, but it can expand over hundreds of thousands of years and over tens of parsecs before its speed falls below the local sound speed.\n\nOne of the best observed young supernova remnants was formed by SN 1987A, a supernova in the Large Magellanic Cloud that was observed in February 1987. Other well-known supernova remnants include the Crab Nebula, Tycho, the remnant of SN 1572, named after Tycho Brahe who recorded the brightness of its original explosion, and Kepler, the remnant of SN 1604, named after Johannes Kepler. The youngest known remnant in our galaxy is G1.9+0.3, discovered in the galactic center.[1]\n\nContents\n\nFree expansion of the ejecta, until they sweep up their own weight in circumstellar or interstellar medium. This can last tens to a few hundred years depending on the density of the surrounding gas.\n\nSweeping up of a shell of shocked circumstellar and interstellar gas. This begins the Sedov-Taylor phase, which can be well modeled by a self-similar analytic solution. Strong X-ray emission traces the strong shock waves and hot shocked gas.\n\nCooling of the shell, to form a thin (< 1 pc), dense (1-100 million atoms per cubic metre) shell surrounding the hot (few million kelvin) interior. This is the pressure-driven snowplow phase. The shell can be clearly seen in optical emission from recombining ionized hydrogen and ionized oxygen atoms.\n\nCooling of the interior. The dense shell continues to expand from its own momentum. This stage is best seen in the radio emission from neutral hydrogen atoms.\n\nMerging with the surrounding interstellar medium. When the supernova remnant slows to the speed of the random velocities in the surrounding medium, after roughly 30,000 years, it will merge into the general turbulent flow, contributing its remaining kinetic energy to the turbulence.\n\nComposite, in which a shell contains a central pulsar wind nebula, such as G11.2-0.3 or G21.5-0.9.\n\nMixed-morphology (also called \"thermal composite\") remnants, in which central thermal X-ray emission is seen, enclosed by a radio shell. The thermal X-rays are primarily from swept-up interstellar material, rather than supernova ejecta. Examples of this class include the SNRs W28 and W44. (Confusingly, W44 additionally contains a pulsar and pulsar wind nebula; so it is simultaneously both a \"classic\" composite and a thermal composite.)\n\nThe remnant of SN 1006 observed in X-rays. The inner emission comes from the hot plasma, whereas the two bright caps are produced by electrons accelerated at the shock front.\n\nSupernova remnants are considered the major source of galactic cosmic rays.[2][3][4] The connection between cosmic rays and supernovas was first suggested by Walter Baade and Fritz Zwicky in 1934. Vitaly Ginzburg and Sergei Syrovatskii in 1964 remarked that if the efficiency of cosmic ray acceleration in supernova remnants is about 10 percent, the cosmic ray losses of the Milky Way are compensated. This hypothesis is supported by a specific mechanism called \"shock wave acceleration\" based on Enrico Fermi's ideas, which is still under development.[citation needed]\n\nIndeed, Enrico Fermi proposed in 1949 a model for the acceleration of cosmic rays through particle collisions with magnetic clouds in the interstellar medium.[5] This process, known as the \"Second Order Fermi Mechanism\", increases particle energy during head-on collisions, resulting in a steady gain in energy. A later model to produce Fermi Acceleration was generated by a powerful shock front moving through space. Particles that repeatedly cross the front of the shock can gain significant increases in energy. This became known as the \"First Order Fermi Mechanism\".[6]\n\nSupernova remnants can provide the energetic shock fronts required to generate ultra-high energy cosmic rays. Observation of the SN 1006 remnant in the X-ray has shown synchrotron emission consistent with it being a source of cosmic rays.[2] However, for energies higher than about 1015 eV a different mechanism is required as supernova remnants cannot provide sufficient energy.[6]\n\nIt is still unclear whether supernova remnants accelerate cosmic rays up to PeV energies. The future telescope CTA will help to answer this question."}
{"text": "The Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram\n\nThere are stars both smaller and bigger than the Sun. The lifetime of\nthe Sun is 10 billion years.

The following relation holds:\n\nSmaller stars than the Sun\nbut large enough to obtain ignition, red dwarfs, burn the fuel more\nslowly and might last hundreds of billions of years. Stars with masses\nless than approx. 3 times the mass of the Sun get so hot in the core\nthat they can burn (fuse) atoms of helium to produce carbon; the\ntemperature is not enough in these stars to make anything else. More\nmassive stars burn carbon to oxygen, and then to silicon and finally\niron. Iron is a very stable nucleus and no nuclei heavier than iron\nare produced in stars. Regardless of their mass, most stars spend most\nof the time burning hydrogen.\nTwo astronomers, Hertzsprung and Russell, noticed that when they\nplotted, for each star, its luminosity vs. its temperature, most stars\nwould cluster along a line. (Note: luminosity is the energy that the\nstar radiates at all wavelengths in one second; recall -see the Tutorial - that the\nluminosity L = 4 x 3.14 x R2 x T4, where s = the Stefan-Boltzman constant. In the figure\nbelow, the luminosity of a star is given with respect to the\nluminosity of the Sun).\n\nThe temperature of the star is its surface\ntemperature - recall that we can think of a star as a \"black body\" that emits\nradiation with a peak emission given by its temperature.\nStars hotter than the Sun are bluish, while cooler ones are reddish.\nThe place where stars bunch up in the diagram is called the \"main sequence\".\nMore massive and luminous stars are at the top; less luminous, cooler\nstars are at the bottom.\n\nFor most of its life a star\nstays in one point of the diagram. However, towards the end of its life,\na star like the Sun will move right and up of the diagram,\nin the so called \"red giant branch\". In this branch, where stars have\nconverted part of their hydrogen fuel (12 % in mass) into He, the core\nof a star starts to contract while the outer layer expands and become\ncooler (red giants have a lower temperature than the original\nstar). When this happens to the Sun, 4-5 billion years from now, the\nouter reaches of our star will hit the Earth and perhaps Mars.\nIn the meantime, the core\ncontracts so rapidly that helium (He) becomes so hot that it burns quickly into carbon (He\nflash). The outer layers are blown off and the star crosses the\ndiagram right to left (i.e., its surface temperature increases) very\nquickly - this is called \"the horizontal branch\". Finally the inner\ncore will forms a \"white dwarf\" that, having burned up its fuel, slowly\ncools until it will not be visible.\n\nStars three times or more massive than the Sun will be able to\nmaintain high temperatures in the core for longer periods of time and\nwill be able to burn other elements as well.\n\nPlanetary nebula NGC 6720.\nThe colored shadows give us information about the\nelements produced by the star.\nCredits:Howard Bond (ST ScI) and NASA\n\nIt is important to\nrealize that the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram is a snapshot of the\nluminosity and temperature of all stars at a given moment; most stars\nare seen on the main sequence because they move off sequence for\nrelatively brief periods of time (in the case of the Sun for hundreds\nof million of years compared to a lifetime of 10 billion years).

{"text": "wrong. You continue to ignore the simple fact that the intenstity varies as 1/r^2. So the contamination from the dust in a normal galaxy will be lower than that of the Milky Way.\n\nIntensity in terms of the power received from a given source at distance r does decline as 1/r^2. However, the surface brightness (the power you receive from a source per steradian occupied by the source) does not change. It stays constant with distance (excepting extinction and non-Euclidean/expansion effects at high z such as redshift). The amount of radiant power you receive from the galaxies in some solid angle of the sky, depends only on the intrinsic surface brightness of the galaxies (which are independent of distance) and the fraction of that solid angle which is covered by the galaxies. In this case, I estimated 4% of the sky is covered with galaxies. Does that make sense to you now?\n\nThe paper is about improving the removal of all sources of foreground contamination including extragalactic point sources.If there's an average of 250,000 galaxies per pixel, assuming a Poisson distribution and that all galaxies are randomly distributed across the sky, the standard deviation (pixel to pixel) is 0.2%.\n\nThis is orders of magnitude bigger than the signal variation that is being measured (approx. 0.005%). What's more, it's probably an underestimate, because galaxy size is not evenly distributed: the large galaxies will have the biggest effect, but they are far rarer than small galaxies. So their Poisson uncertainty is higher.\n\nThen you have to consider if the distribution of galaxies is truly isotropic and randomly distributed. Do we have a systematically higher density of galaxies along some sightlines relative to others.\n\nBut the next stage is to evaluate the dependence of the overall uncertainty on this Poisson variation, and to do that is what the whole discussion on this thread is about ! If galaxies are completely transparent to the CMB, and also contribute almost zero to it at the the wavelengths under consideration, then it's a negligible source of error.\n\nThe amount of radiant power you receive from the galaxies in some solid angle of the sky, depends only on the intrinsic surface brightness of the galaxies (which are independent of distance) and the fraction of that solid angle which is covered by the galaxies(bold added)If galaxies are completely transparent to the CMB, and also contribute almost zero to it at the the wavelengths under consideration, then it's a negligible source of error.\n\nJust thinking out loud.\n\nNereid and ngc3314 did some estimates of surface brightness of galaxies (like ours) due directly to starlight:\n\nTo take Nereid's example in an earlier post, if we approximate the Milky Way as 100 billion sunlike stars, their collective cross-section is about 10^11 x (106 km)^2 = 1023 km^2 spread over (100,000 light-years)2 = 10^36 km2, so the collective spectrum would be an approximate 5500 K blackbody distribution, but with surface brightness lower by a factor 10^13 than predicted by the Planck blackbody function.\n\nSo, let's see how that works out for the CMB spectrum using the equation for intensity ratio of two emitters at 200 GHz with temperatures T1 and T2 which I approximated from Planck's law as:\n\nI2/I1 = (e^(10/T1) - 1)/(e^(10/T2) - 1)\n\nWhere T2 = 5500 K and T1 = 2.7 K\n\nI2(star)/I1(CMB) = 40/0.0018 = 2.2*10^5\n\nHowever, starlight intensity is diluted by a factor of 10^-13 due to their sparseness, so:\n\nI2(galaxy)/I1(CMB) = 2.2*10^-8. Thus the direct contribution from starlight from a galaxy is indeed very small in comparison with the CMB. The Planck probe sensitivity to differences in CMB is at best about 1 part per million which is 50 times greater that the direct effect of galaxy starlight.\n\nSo yes, the direct affects of galactic starlight should be negligible!\n\nI'd still like to understand how exactly the same dilution arises for dust emissions, but so far no one has replied about that. It bothers me because dust appears opaque in the optical spectrum and so should act more like a black body.\n\n------------------------------------\n\nAnother possibility to consider:\n\nThe only way I can see that starlight from galaxies could seriously affect CMB measurements is if something happens to starlight on it's path to us over billions of light years that moves a very small part of the stellar energy into the CMB spectral range.\n\nThe ratio of total energy from a star in comparison to total energy from the CMB is about 2*10^13\n\nif a small fraction, say 10-5 (1 part in 100,000), of stellar energy is somehow moved into the CMB spectral range as it travels to us, it would very seriously contaminate the CMB spectrum (at the level of 40 micro Kelvin) wherever there is a galaxy on the sky. If there is some physical effect that moves such small amounts of stellar energy into the CMB spectrum without scattering it's possible that we could find it with the Planck data by looking for CMB variations where galaxies are denser than average. This is still somewhat difficult because the Planck resolution is only about 5'.And so on.\n\nI recently saw some paper that discussed transparency, but I think they concluded that the optical seeing through a galaxy wasn't all that useful. Of course the transparency really doesn't matter, only the surface brightness matters, including whatever radiation passes right through. If the radiation is adsorbed, then it has to be re-radiated (at lower T).\n\nIf a galaxy is tilted or on edge, then in the CMB spectrum its surface brightness may be proportionally higher per solid angle, if dust is more or less transparent at CMB frequencies.\n\nSo let's say that galaxies have some average surface brightness which only extends slightly farther than the optical disk. What is you estimate of sky coverage?\n\nI made my guess just looking at the HUDF image (low resolution), I think it might be conservative, but one would need the actual data to either do a complete integration or a Monte Carlo analysis. I wonder if anyone has. Of course at high red shift we don't have a very good idea of surface brightness yet AFAIK, except for CIB measurements. Maybe when JWT is in place all estimates will get a lot better. I believe it will be sensitive much deeper into the infrared than HSTTo be more exact they remove about 500 detectable powerful point sources. If you cannot detect a point source then it is really hard to remove its contamination!\n\nN.B. These are the point sources that are detectable by WMAP. Future missions like PLANCK will have higher sensitivity and will detect more point sources that will have to be removedYou might want to check your calculations, and also take a hard look at a field imaged by the Hubble and extensively studied by other instruments (e.g. GOODS, COSMOS). You may find that, in terms of coverage of the sky's real estate, the higher redshift objects ('galaxies') may, collectively, dominate.\n\nThen you have to consider if the distribution of galaxies is truly isotropic and randomly distributed. Do we have a systematically higher density of galaxies along some sightlines relative to others.\n\nGalaxies are known to cluster; they form groups, and clusters of various 'sizes'. They also tend to be found near or on 'filaments'.\n\nThose in rich clusters are also found, generally, to be in approximately spherical clouds of hot plasma; the estimated baryonic mass of these clouds exceeds the estimated total mass of the constituent galaxies by a factor of several. Per textbook physics, if the CMB is 'behind' such a cluster, the plasma will leave an imprint on the CMB; this is called the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effectWP* (the SZE). An important test of our understanding of the CMB is whether a) the SZE can be detected in WMAP (and similar) data, from known rich clusters; and b) whether Planck can, blindly, find previously unknown rich clusters (via the SZE footprint).\n\nInterestingly, both tests have been done, and the results are ... interesting. For WMAP, the observed SZE is not quite what was expected, from theoretical models, thus pointing to something new we learned about rich clusters of galaxies. For Planck, the blind search indeed turned up several previously unknown rich clusters; it also found some, um, unusual structures.\n\nOf course, there are independent facilities studying the region of the spectrum where the CMB signal is strongest, and searches by these should also find, independently, both known and previously unknown rich clusters (via the SZE). At least one has (the South Pole Telescope).\n\nSo let's say that galaxies have some average surface brightness which only extends slightly farther than the optical disk. What is you estimate of sky coverage?\n\nLet's not.\n\nThis paper, by Tal and van Dokkum, shows that the LRGs in SDSS, collectively, extend far beyond \"the optical disk\" (ignoring, for a moment, that ellipticals don't have disks).\n\nAnd this one, by Bakos and Trujillo (which I posted earlier in this thread), shows that spirals (or the stars in them) emit detectable light well beyond \"the optical disk\".\n\nUsing the distribution of stellar light as a proxy for dust is not a good ideaI'm not sure I understand what you're asking; could you explain a bit more please? issuesIf you make this assumption (7 times as much gas), a lot of problems disappear.\n\nWell, of course they do, with such an assumption. This is essentially why dark matter is hypothesized - the observed rotation implies there must be a lot more unseen mass in the galaxy. The reason why the \"gas\" or baryon hypothesis is not favored is because baryons are generally detectable, yet we're not detecting them. So, the thinking goes, it must be something not directly detectable -- dark matter. If someone can explain why we are not detecting 7 times the amount of baryons that we currently detect, then they may be on to something. But again, there are numerous ways to detect baryons. Add them all together, and we fall woefully short. That's a lot of baryons to hide.\n\nCougar wrote: If someone can explain why we are not detecting 7 times the amount of baryons that we currently detect, then they may be on to something.\n\nThat's what he's trying to do -saying why we are not detecting the bulk of the gas.\n\nHowever the question in this thread was, imagine IF the hypothesis is correct, that is, there is a lot of \"self-opaque\" gas in galaxies, what would that do to the CMB observations ? The author does not address these extra-galactic questions and I am wondering about it. Bruce Draine and his collaborators have written a number of high quality, in-depth papers on the subject, but they're extremely dense and technical.\n\nThey are; even in the far-IR, where cold dust emits most of its light, the absorption efficiency is down around 1E-6 or 1E-5, and it gets still lower as the wavelengths get longer. Since the wavelengths involved are much, much longer than the grains are wide (their radii are in the sub-micron range and smaller for the most part), far-IR, microwaves, and radio tend to either diffract around dielectric grains or pass right on by.\n\nThe optical depth through a column of dust can be written as n*pi*a^2*Q*s, where n is the number density of dust particles, a is the radius of a dust grain, Q is the absorption/scattering efficiency, and s is the path length through the cloud (this of course assumes a uniform dust density, composition, and grain size, but this gets us within an order of magnitude of the answer or two). An optical depth of 1 means that, on average, a photon has interacted with at least one particle; higher optical depths imply more interactions per photon. For typical values of the Milky Way ISM, the path length needed to get an optical depth of 1 is on the order of gigaparsecs, but the dust is not nearly so concentrated as the MW ISM on those scales. Given this, it seems to me that dust opacity to microwaves is totally insignificant when measuring the CMB, though I've not read the WMAP papers to see what the science team thinksOriginally Posted by ctcoker\n\nOriginally Posted by Nereid\n\nThanks.Bruce Draine and his collaborators have written a number of high quality, in-depth papers on the subject, but they're extremely dense and technical.\n\nI have read quite a few of those, and yes, they do seem in-depth and very high quality but also extremely dense and technical\n\nOf possible pertinence to some of TooMany's questions may be one (I forget exactly which one) which shows that the estimated energy absorbed, in a spiral galaxy (the MW?) in the UV-optical-NIR part of the spectrum (and emitted by stars, mostly) is the same (to within the estimated errors) as that emitted (re-radiated) in the rest of the IR (and sub-mm) range (by dust). And why is this - possibly - directly relevant? I'd like to wait until TooMany returns, to see if he can work it out for himself (I'm a great believer in discovery learning). Of course, if anyone else would like to post an explanation ... issuesThe author tackles a quite large number of questions/problems/sets of observations ('issues'); not surprisingly, as this is just a single paper (albeit one > 30 pages long), not many of the issues are covered in depth. That - necessarily - means that a reader with a critical-thinking hat on would have many questions about many of the issues that cannot be answered (because of the lack of depth). A general one might be this: Davies takes a close look at several areas, and examines/questions/challenges the consistency generally accepted in the literature; however, in doing so, he accepts other areas of consistency. There's nothing wrong with that (of course! ), but a closer analysis of some of these may show 'consistency links' that give rise to various problems of their own (this is a muddled way of saying that if you pull on a thread in a densely woven fabric, you never know what you might end up unraveling). Both Cougar and Tensor (and maybe others) - both in this thread and the other where kzb introduced the paper - have made this point already (in one way or another).\n\nSome specifics, in no particular order, and by no means comprehensive (and not necessarily well-thought through either! ):\n\n* \"Galaxies were selected such that they have angular diameters (r25) greater than 1 arc min\", and \"The only remaining problem is how does the size given in LEDA (r25) equate to the size R0 used in our model (Note: R0 is the physical size of the disc), which we are assuming is the same as the cut-off observed at 21cm (see below).\" How does Davies deal with inclination?\n\n* a* \"Finally, by using t > 2 we hopefully restrict our analysis to galaxies dominated by their disc.\" One of the interesting results to come from Galaxy Zoo is that this is not a safe assumption, and that it is possible to reliably study variation due to bulge/disk ratio (Davies probably didn't know about Lackner and Gunn (2012) when he was writing his paper, if he had, I'm sure he'd have at least referenced it)\n\n* \"This discrepancy between observed and predicted baryons is typically accounted for by invoking a huge reservoir of baryons in the warm inter-galactic medium (see the introduction of Takei et al. 2011 for a recent discussion of the issue). An alternative is that they actually reside in the disc of galaxies.\" Davies, in this paper, does not cover any significant aspect of \"the issue\", so we have no way to tell if putting all the 'cluster dark mass' into massive gas disks in the cluster galaxies has issues of its own! Most readers could likely come up with a pretty lengthy list of 'issue candidates' ...\n\n* Section 5.5 (\"Constraints imposed by quasar absorption lines\") is really short, and (for me) raises at least twice as many questions as those Davies seeks to address!\n\n* If Section 5.5 leaves you unsatisfied, Section 5.6 (\"Dwarf galaxies\") is even worse. One particular beef: the only three papers cited are dated 1997 and 1998; an awful lot of work has been done on dwarf galaxies since then, so why did Davies not cite any of it (Section 5.5 is even worse in this regard)?\n\n* are\"10^-6 as emitting as a blackbody\" immediately meant emissivity to me. I'm a grad student in astronomy, and the project I'm currently finishing up depends heavily on dust opacities and emissivities, so this was all fresh in my mind. And for a greybody, of course, emissivity and absorption efficiency are the same thing.For theory papers, yes, if there's been no significant development, old may be good.\n\nFor almost every aspect of observational astronomy, it's a bad thing, sometimes a really, really bad thing.\n\nDavies cites THINGS, a recent HI observational survey, but not SDSS (he uses LEDA to pick his galaxies, not one of the value-added SDSS catalogues, for example). One advantage of more recent observational results - especially surveys - is much greater attention to systematics. Papers based on analysis of recent observations are, IMHO, better than those based on older ones (generally; there are obvious exceptions). Did Davies simply not know of the more recent work (hard to believe)?Um, no.\n\nIf, per Davies, spiral galaxies have a massive gas disk that has a 'sharp' edge, then the observed rotation curve - beyond that edge - will reflect this; if there's a massive halo, extending far beyond R0, then then the observed rotation curve - beyond that edge - will reflect that. Either way, it (potentially) offers a good, quick way to test Davies' main hypothesis. Why he chose not to apply that test is ... odd.No, inclination data is available in LEDA (and HI data from THINGS, etc).\n\nAfter all, the astronomers (like Bill Keel/NGC3314) researching dust in spirals, by studying extinction (etc) at various wavelengths as inclination varies, have been using that data for decades.\n\nOf course, it's entirely possible Davies 'corrected' for inclination (but simply didn't mention it); however, it's odd that he didn't, given its potential to test his main hypothesis.No, not really. some someShouldn't the collisionless nature of CDM together with virialization of CDM particles through gravitational interaction force a certain distribution? Baryonic matter could be discounted for a first order approximation."}
{"text": "Two Most Massive Black Holes Discovered\n\nA team of North American astronomers have discovered the two largest supermassive black holes yet found \u2014 each a nearly unfathomable 10 billion times the mass of Earth's Sun \u2014 the Gemini Observatory announced on Monday.\n\n\"We see them only because of their gravitational pull on nearby orbiting stars,\" said team leaer Chung-Pei Ma, an astronomy professor at the University of California, Berkeley, in a release from the Gemini Observatory.\n\n\"These black holes may shed light on how black holes and their surrounding galaxies have nurtured each other since the early universe,\" said University of California, Berkeley grad student Nicholas McConnell, the first author of a paper on the find that will be published in the December 8 edition of the journal Nature, according to a Berkeley press release.\n\nThe new largest supermassive black holes are thought to be the similar to those that powered quasars, the most distant, brightest and among the most mysterious objects from the early days of the universe.\n\nBoth black holes were discovered using the Gemini North telescope on Mauna Kea, Hawaii.\n\nThe second supermassive black hole might be even larger, up to 21 billion times the mass of Earth's sun, the New York Times reported, and was found in the elliptical galaxy NGC 4889, located 336 million light years away from Earth in the Coma cluster.\n\nBoth galaxies are part of the Coma supercluster and can be viewed with amateur telescopes, the Gemini Observatory reported.\n\nFor comparison, one solar mass, the size of Earth's Sun, is roughly equivalent to 330,000 times the mass of the Earth.\n\nMoreover, the event horizons for the black holes \u2014 the region at which no light is able to escape getting sucked into the black holes \u2014 are far larger than the entirety of our Solar System, with each event horizon extending five to ten times as large as Pluto's orbit.\n\n\"This means we need exquisite observing conditions and the latest technology to have any hope of seeing what's going on around the black hole,\" McConnell said in the Gemini release.\n\nSupermassive black holes are those millions or billions of times the mass of Earth's sun. Previously, the largest known was found at the center of the galaxy M87, measuring 6.6 billion solar masses, also measured using the Gemini North telescope.\n\nAll large galaxies are thought to have a supermassive black hole at the center, including our own, the Milky Way. That black hole, Sagittarius A Star, is thought to be at least 2.6 million solar masses and up to 4 million solar masses.\n\nAnd many more questions have been sparked by the finding of the new black holes, chief among them: How did they get so large? Either due to sucking up stellar gas, which they are no longer doing, or from the merging of two galaxies into one larger galaxyAlso, are these two black holes rare giants or just the first of a whole crowd of previously unknown supermassive black holes?\n\nThose answers are still floating out there in space.\n\nThe team's research was funded by the National Science Foundation, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and UC Berkeley's Miller Institute for Basic Research in Science."}

{"text": "Cosmic explosion is most distant ever seen\n\nAstronomers have detected the most distant gamma-ray burst ever found. The cosmic explosion came from a star that detonated about 12.8 billion light years from Earth.\n\nGamma-ray bursts are fleeting blasts of high-energy radiation that occur when massive stars die and shoot out high-speed jets of matter. The expanding matter initially produces gamma rays, but when it starts colliding with surrounding gas, it creates afterglows at longer wavelengths.\n\nThe new record holder, called GRB 080913, was first detected on 13 September by NASA's Swift space observatory. Telescopes around the world soon detected its afterglow at longer wavelengths, and the light spectrum they observed revealed its incredible distance: 12.8 billion light years away.\n\nThat is about 70 million light years farther than the previous record holder. \"This is the most amazing burst Swift has seen,\" said Swift's lead scientist Neil Gehrels in a statement.\n\nAstronomers have been hoping to discover very distant GRBs because they exploded when the universe was young - they are being seen now because their light took billions of years to reach Earth. These ancient GRBs could reveal details about the lives and deaths of the very earliest stars.\n\nGRB 080913 exploded less than 825 million years after the big bang. \"This burst accompanies the death of a star from one of the universe's early generations,\" said Swift team member Patricia Schady of University College LondonWhen Will They Learn?\n\nSat Sep 20 14:13:35 BST 2008 by Marco Kaiser\n\nWhy do those articles always read as if the hypothesis that the universe is 13.7 billion years old is a fact. As I have stated many times it is not a fact and it would surprise me if it would not soon be discovered that it's much older. So please stop writing this as if it was 100% proven fact. I always have to laugh, when I read \"when the universe was young\" or \"shortly after the big bang\" in combination with numbers of 12 - 13.7 billion years. Dear astronomers and article writers, please get off your high horses and learn to use words like \"estimated\" or \"which is thought\" or \"at the moment....is believed to be\" and so on. I can't wait till Hubble is upgraded.\n\nSo in the limit of infinite red shift, where space is expanding faster than light, the radius of the visible universe is about 14.1 billion light years.\n\nSince accelertion to and beyond light speed requires infinite energy, limiting the size of the universe to the visible envelope is typical. Hence the univese can be no more than 14.1 billion light years old.\n\nWhen Will They Learn?\n\nSun Sep 21 10:51:51 BST 2008 by Marco Kaiser\n\nSorry, but this is nonsense. Forget your calculations for a second and use reason. If it would take an infinite amount of energy to reach light speed and beyond, we would have no chance to ever reach distant stars and galaxies in the future. Why are we researching, developing and living then, if we are so limited? What would be the meaning of life if we could only develop to the point of below light speed travel, that's absolutely illogical, besides the fact that photons reach light speed and that it has been scientifically proven that entangled photons can communicate at speeds of at least 10.000 times the speed of light. Even if we could never reach those speeds (which is nonsense) why do those speeds exist in the universe then? Let me tell you this: We will be able to travel much faster than the speed of light in the future, once we understand how tachyons work and are able to use \"hyperspace\". It will not be tomorrow, but we will get there.\n\nWhen Will They Learn?\n\nSun Sep 21 16:01:06 BST 2008 by Horatio\n\nI like the way you tell one guy that he's talking nonsense, and then write about how we're going to be using tachyons to travel through hyperspace... You state that life at less than light speed is 'illogical' - what on earth does that mean? Then you talk about hyperspace like it's something real after dissing cosmologists for daring to be confident in their estimations of the age of the Universe.\n\nNot knocking you, but if you're going to cite 'using reason', then perhaps you can think of ways in which we can advance within the framework of reality without invoking hyperspace or tachyons. Sub-c travel is still a valid research path. Also, entangled photons don't necessarily \"communicate\" - have a read about the phenomenum and its implications.\n\nWhen Will They Learn?\n\n\"It has been scientifically proven that entangled photons can communicate at speeds of at least 10.000 times the speed of light.\" - Marco Kaiser\n\nEntangled photons are thought not to \"communicate\" but spontaneously alter their entangled states.\n\nThe aspect of the particle in question that is being measured is considered a manifestation of a single entity, even though they are widely separated.\n\nIn quantum mechanics, the transmission of all force carriers is thought to occurr at infinite speed in absolute terms by reduce to a finite limit of c as a result of scattering delay by the particles created from the energy of the vacuum.\n\nSince entanglement doesn't involve force carriers, it occurrs instantly - it is thought.\n\nWhen Will They Learn?\n\nMon Sep 22 11:54:25 BST 2008 by Mike\n\nHang on: Your 'reason' for insisting that it doesn't take an infinite amount of energy for a object with mass to reach the speed of light is basically 'then we won't be able to build spaceships'. I can't understand how you use this line of logic to undermine everything we have observed in physics. Just because your 'reason for living' matters to you, it doesn't mean that it has an effect on the world around you.\n\n\"What would be the meaning of life if we could only develop to the point of below light speed travel, that's absolutely illogical\"\n\nThat's a huge non sequeteur: That the physical laws of existence as we have observed them are 'wrong' and 'illogical' because the point of life is to fly in spaceships? Firstly, there is nothing except blind faith and fear of deathand being alone that leads us to believe in such a concept as a higher 'meaning of life'. Elsewhere in nature, the meaning of life is simply to survive and reproduce. Assuming that we are 'better' is purely a matter of faith, which in itself is niether logical of demonstrable. Secondly, what on earth makes you think that the point of life is for us to reach distant galaxies, anyway, and what makes that a certainty that our science is 'wrong'?\n\nThese speeds exist in the universe so that the universe works properly. If they didn't; we wouldn't be sitting here. They don't exist so that we can 'logically' [!] attain or breach them.\n\nWe are always fast-on-the-draw here to ridicule faith in gods or intellegent design, but what what is being proposed is an equally groundless faith in sci-fi, rather than observed and proven science.\n\nWhen Will They Learn?\n\nSun Sep 21 18:27:46 BST 2008 by William Curry\n\nYour calculation's correct IF and only IF the red shift is a Doppler shift.\n\nThe modern problem with cosmology began with an \"assumption\" about the nature of the red shift in the spectrum of faint extragalactic objects, discovered by Edwin Hubble. Hubble wrote, \"If the red shifts are a Doppler shift ... The observations as they stand lead to the anomaly of a closed universe, curiously small and dense, and, it may be added, suspiciously young. On the other hand, if red shifts are not Doppler effects, these anomalies disappear and the region observed appears as a small, homogeneous, but insignificant portion of a universe extended indefinitely both in space and time.\ufffd (Royal Astronomical Society Monthly Notices, 17, 506, 1937).\n\nPlugging in the Hubble constant estimate as Vendicar's 70.1 and entering an extreme red shift, z of 1 billion seems to max out the distance estimate to some 8.55 Giga parsecs which is suspiciously close to double Vendicar's result. It could be that the calculator is in error as this would suggest a light travel time of 8.55 E9* 3.26156 = some 27.887 billion years from the observable horizon of the universe. Or it could be that there is a little more to be done in order to extract the age of the universe from the informtion. Ofcourse this is where my understanding of these matters is very fallable. Does light travel time from the observable horizon (which is what z=infinity means) necessarily translate into the age of the universe? I ask this as I have always found the concept to be a particularly slimy one."}
{"text": "Friday, July 1, 2011\n\nGalaxies once thought of as voracious tigers are more like grazing cows, according to a new study using NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope.\n\nAstronomers have discovered that galaxies in the distant, early universe continuously ingested their star-making fuel over long periods of time. This goes against previous theories that the galaxies devoured their fuel in quick bursts after run-ins with other galaxies.\n\nThis split view shows how a normal spiral galaxy around our local universe (left) might have looked back in the distant universe, when astronomers think galaxies would have been filled with larger populations of hot, bright stars (right).\n\nNASA's Spitzer Space Telescope discovered that distant populations of galaxies formed massive, bright stars more commonly than today's \"diet-conscious\" galaxies. Such early galaxies would have been brighter, bluer and more irregular than spiral galaxies today due to the large proportion of massive stars.\n\nThe Spitzer observations also demonstrate that these distant galaxies fed off steady streams of gas, rather than bursts of gas stirred up from collisions with other galaxies.\n\nThis artist's rendering is derived from the Hubble image of NGC 1309.\nImage credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/STScI\n\n\"Our study shows the merging of massive galaxies was not the dominant method of galaxy growth in the distant universe,\" said Ranga-Ram Chary of NASA's Spitzer Science Center at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, Calif. \"We're finding this type of galactic cannibalism was rare. Instead, we are seeing evidence for a mechanism of galaxy growth in which a typical galaxy fed itself through a steady stream of gas, making stars at a much faster rate than previously thought.\"\n\nChary is the principal investigator of the research, appearing in the Aug. 1 issue of the Astrophysical Journal. According to his findings, these grazing galaxies fed steadily over periods of hundreds of millions of years and created an unusual amount of plump stars, up to 100 times the mass of our sun.\n\n\"This is the first time that we have identified galaxies that supersized themselves by grazing,\" said Hyunjin Shim, also of the Spitzer Science Center and lead author of the paper. \"They have many more massive stars than our Milky Way galaxy.\"\n\nGalaxies like our Milky Way are giant collections of stars, gas and dust. They grow in size by feeding off gas and converting it to new stars. A long-standing question in astronomy is: Where did distant galaxies that formed billions of years ago acquire this stellar fuel? The most favored theory was that galaxies grew by merging with other galaxies, feeding off gas stirred up in the collisions.\n\nChary and his team addressed this question by using Spitzer to survey more than 70 remote galaxies that existed 1 to 2 billion years after the Big Bang (our universe is approximately 13.7 billion years old). To their surprise, these galaxies were blazing with what is called H alpha, which is radiation from hydrogen gas that has been hit with ultraviolet light from stars. High levels of H alpha indicate stars are forming vigorously. Seventy percent of the surveyed galaxies show strong signs of H alpha. By contrast, only 0.1 percent of galaxies in our local universe possess this signature.\n\nPrevious studies using ultraviolet-light telescopes found about six times less star formation than Spitzer, which sees infrared light. Scientists think this may be due to large amounts of obscuring dust, through which infrared light can sneak. Spitzer opened a new window onto the galaxies by taking very long-exposure infrared images of a patch of sky called the GOODS fields, for Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey.\n\nFurther analyses showed that these galaxies furiously formed stars up to 100 times faster than the current star-formation rate of our Milky Way. What's more, the star formation took place over a long period of time, hundreds of millions of years. This tells astronomers that the galaxies did not grow due to mergers, or collisions, which happen on shorter timescales. While such smash-ups are common in the universe -- for example, our Milky Way will merge with the Andromeda galaxy in about 5 billion years -- the new study shows that large mergers were not the main cause of galaxy growth. Instead, the results show that distant, giant galaxies bulked up by feeding off a steady supply of gas that probably streamed in from filaments of dark matter.\n\nChary said, \"If you could visit a planet in one of these galaxies, the sky would be a crazy place, with tons of bright stars, and fairly frequent supernova explosions"}
{"text": "Galaxy Evolution\n\nby Fraser Cain on May 11, 2009\n\nWant to stay on top of all the space news? Follow @universetoday on Twitter\n\nAs astronomers look out into the Universe, they're also looking back in time. By seeing an object 1 billion light-years away, astronomers are seeing how the object looked 1 billion years ago, since the light took a billion years to reach us. This \"time machine\" effect allows astronomers to study galaxy evolution; how small galaxies built up over time to become the structures we see in the Universe today.\n\nAfter the Big Bang, the Universe was the same everywhere. But tiny fluctuations in density made some regions attact others with more gravity, and over time, regions began to clump together into larger and larger structure. These clumps became primordial galaxies, and clumps of hydrogen gas within the proto-galaxies became the first stars.\n\nSome of these early objects were small, and became tiny dwarf galaxies, while others were much larger and became the familiar spiral shapes, like our own Milky Way.\n\nOnce formed, these galaxies evolved together in larger galactic structures called groups, clusters and superclusters. Galaxies were attracted to one another by gravity, and collided together in a series of mergers. The outcome of these mergers depends on the mass of the galaxies in the collision.\n\nSmall galaxies are torn apart by larger galaxies and added to the mass of larger galaxies. Our own Milky Way recently devoured a few dwarf galaxies, turning them into streams of stars that orbit the galactic core. But when large galaxies of similar size come together, they become giant elliptical galaxies. The delicate spiral structure is lost, and the merged galaxies become large and egg-shaped. This will be the outcome for our own Milky Way galaxy when it merges with Andromeda in a few billion years.\n\nAnd so, galaxy evolution has been occurring over billions of years, and it will continue to happen for the foreseeable future. Galaxies will continue to evolve and change as they interact with other galaxies."}
{"text": "Newly merged black hole eagerly shreds stars\n\nApr 08, 2011\n\nIn this artist's conception, two black holes are about to merge. When they combine, gravitational wave radiation will \"kick\" the black hole like a rocket engine, sending it rampaging through nearby stars. Credit: David A. Aguilar (CfA)\n\nA galaxy's core is a busy place, crowded with stars swarming around an enormous black hole. When galaxies collide, it gets even messier as the two black holes spiral toward each other, merging to make an even bigger gravitational monster.\n\nOnce it is created, the monster goes on a rampage. The merger kicks the black hole into surrounding stars. There it finds a hearty meal, shredding and swallowing stars at a rapid clip. According to new research by Nick Stone and Avi Loeb (Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics), upcoming sky surveys might offer astronomers a way to catch a gorging black hole \"in the act.\"\n\nBefore the merger, as the two black holes whirl around each other, they stir the galactic center like the blade of a blender. Their strong gravity warps space, sending out ripples known as gravitational waves. When the black holes merge, they emit gravitational waves more strongly in one direction. That inequality kicks the black hole in the opposite direction like a rocket engine.\n\n\"That kick is very important. It can shove the black hole toward stars that otherwise would have been at a safe distance,\" said Stone.\n\n\"Essentially, the black hole can go from starving to enjoying an all-you-can-eat buffet,\" he added.\n\nWhen tidal forces rip a star apart, its remains will spiral around the black hole, smashing and rubbing together, heating up enough to shine in the ultraviolet or X-rays. The black hole will glow as brightly as an exploding star, or supernova, before gradually fading in a distinctive way.\n\nImportantly, a wandering, supermassive black hole is expected to swallow many more stars than a black hole in an undisrupted galactic center. A stationary black hole disrupts one star every 100,000 years. In the best-case scenario, a wandering black hole could disrupt a star every decade. This would give astronomers a much better opportunity of spotting these events, particularly with new survey facilities like Pan-STARRS and the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope.\n\nCatching the signal from a disrupted star is a good start. However, astronomers really want to combine that information with gravitational wave data from the black hole merger. The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), a future mission designed to detect and study gravitational waves, could provide that data.\n\nGravitational wave measurements yield very accurate distances (to better than one part in a hundred, or 1 percent). However, they don't provide precise sky coordinates. A star's tidal disruption will let astronomers pinpoint the galaxy containing the recently merged black-hole binary.\n\nBy correlating the galaxy's redshift (a change in its light that's caused by the expanding universe) with an accurate distance, astronomers can infer the equation of state of dark energy. In other words, they can learn more about the force that's accelerating cosmic expansion, and which dominates the cosmic mass/energy budget today.\n\n\"Instead of 'standard candles' like supernovae, the black hole binary would be a 'standard siren.' Using it, we could create the most accurate cosmic 'ruler' possible,\" stated Loeb.\n\nFinding a merged black hole also would allow theorists to explore a new regime of Einstein's general theory of relativity.\n\n\"We could test general relativity in the regime of strong gravity with unprecedented precision,\" said Loeb. Astronomers using ESO's Very Large Telescope have detected, in another galaxy, a stellar-mass black hole much farther away than any other previously known. With a mass above fifteen times don't have the physics to assess this, but am curious if the current gamma ray event 110328A (not willing to call two weeks a single burst) is a result of a merged black hole system going through its neighbours...\n\nIt is rather interesting (but coincidental) that news of 110328A breaks around the time of this story. At this point, though, I think it's too early to tell precisely what's going on with this galaxy wrt the outburst.\n\nThere's still too little hard info available to make an informed guess. There has been some talk as to if this object is related to blazars (which includes BL Lac and Optically Violent Variable galaxies) which exhibit relatavistic jets beamed toward us.\n\nStan Woosley (UCSC)has opined that this could be a scaled-up version of what we see in standard GRBs. In this case the core of the massive star collapses to form a BH while the outer layers take days to fall in, producing the prolonged outburst: \n\nThis mechanism has been invoked before to explain a handful of unusual (long-duration)GRBs, so there might be some connection"}
{"text": "In this final installment in the Golden State Star Party series, I want to discuss the nature of the galaxies that I photographed.\n\nOne of the reasons that I like astronomy is that it continually stimulates me to contemplate the vast scale of the objects I observe. M81 is the dominant galaxy in a nearby group of galaxies, about 12 million light years from our own. (A light year is the distance that light travels in one year.) Knowing M81's distance and apparent size in the sky, we can readily calculate that it is about 90,000 light years in diameter.\n\nThis has the mind-bending consequence that not only did the photons of light illuminating my camera's image sensor leave M81 over 12 million years ago, but since the photons on the far side of M81 had a greater distance to travel, they had to start about 75,000 years before the photons from the near side. (M81 is tipped from our viewpoint. Otherwise they would have had to start a full 90,000 years earlier.) So, while we think of a picture as representing a moment in time, my picture of M81 is actually smeared out over 75,000 years!\n\nM81 probably contains on the order of 100 billion stars revolving around the center in one of the most beautiful spirals of any galaxy we can see. With my telescope, they all blend together, and even the brightest star is far too small to see. However, a supernova would be visible, and indeed an amateur astronomer discovered one in M81 during 1993. The individual stars surrounding the galaxies in the photo are actually stars in our own galaxy, the Milky Way.\n\nThe other galaxy in my photo, M82, was once thought to be an irregular galaxy; however, modern astronomy has confirmed that M82 is also a spiral.

{"text": "This picture of the star cluster and surrounding nebula NGC 371 was taken using the FORS1 instrument on ESO's Very Large Telescope, at the Paranal Observatory in Chile. NGC 371 lies in the Small Magellanic Cloud, one of the closest galaxies to the Milky Way. (c) ESO/Manu Mejias\n\nThe object dominating this image may resemble a pool of spilled blood, but rather than being associated with death, such regions of ionised hydrogen - known as HII regions - are sites of creation with high rates of recent star birth. NGC 371 is an example of this; it is an open cluster surrounded by a nebula. The stars in open clusters all originate from the same diffuse HII region, and over time the majority of the hydrogen is used up by star formation, leaving behind a shell of hydrogen such as the one in this image, along with a cluster of hot young stars.\n\nThe host galaxy to NGC 371, the Small Magellanic Cloud, is a dwarf galaxy a mere 200 000 light-years away, which makes it one of the closest galaxies to the Milky Way. In addition, the Small Magellanic Cloud contains stars at all stages of their evolution; from the highly luminous young stars found in NGC 371 to supernova remnants of dead stars. These energetic youngsters emit copious amounts of ultraviolet radiation causing surrounding gas, such as leftover hydrogen from their parent nebula, to light up with a colourful glow that extends for hundreds of light-years in every direction. The phenomenon is depicted beautifully in this image, taken using the FORS1 instrument on ESO's Very Large Telescope (VLT).\n\nOpen clusters are by no means rare; there are numerous fine examples in our own Milky Way. However, NGC 371 is of particular interest due to the unexpectedly large number of variable stars it contains. These are stars that change in brightness over time. A particularly interesting type of variable star, known as slowly pulsating B stars, can also be used to study the interior of stars through asteroseismology, and several of these have been confirmed in this cluster. Variable stars play a pivotal role in astronomy: some types are invaluable for determining distances to far-off galaxies and the age of the Universe.\n\nThe data for this image were selected from the ESO archive by Manu Mejias as part of the Hidden Treasures competition. Three of Manu's images made the top twenty; his picture of NGC 371 was ranked sixth in the competition"}
{"text": "Spectral lines are produced by transitions of electrons within atoms or ions. As the electrons move closer to or farther from the nucleus of an atom (or of an ion), energy in the form of light (or other radiation) is emitted or absorbed. The yellow \"D\" lines of sodium (seeD-lines) or the \"H\" and \"K\" lines of ionized calcium (seen as dark absorption lines) are produced by discrete quantum jumps from the lowest energy levels (ground states) of these atoms. The visible hydrogen lines (the so-called Balmer series; seespectral line series), however, are produced by electron transitions within atoms in the second energy level (or first excited state), which lies well above the ground level in energy. Only at high temperatures are sufficient numbers of atoms maintained in this state by collisions, radiations, and so forth to permit an appreciable number of absorptions to occur. At the low surface temperatures of a red dwarf star, few electrons populate the second level of hydrogen, and thus the hydrogen lines are dim. By contrast, at very high temperatures\u2014for instance, that of the surface of a blue giant star\u2014the hydrogen atoms are nearly all ionized and therefore cannot absorb or emit any line radiation. Consequently, only faint dark hydrogen lines are observed. The characteristic features of ionized metals such as iron are often weak in such hotter stars because the appropriate electron transitions involve higher energy levels that tend to be more sparsely populated than the lower levels. Another factor is that the general \"fogginess,\" or opacity, of the atmospheres of these hotter stars is greatly increased, resulting in fewer atoms in the visible stellar layers capable of producing the observed lines.\n\nThe continuous (as distinct from the line) spectrum of the Sun is produced primarily by the photodissociation of negatively charged hydrogen ions (H\u2212)\u2014i.e., atoms of hydrogen to which an extra electron is loosely attached. In the Sun's atmosphere, when H\u2212 is subsequently destroyed by photodissociation, it can absorb energy at any of a whole range of wavelengths and thus produce a continuous range of absorption of radiation. The main source of light absorption in the hotter stars is the photoionization of hydrogen atoms, both from ground level and from higher levels.\n\nSpectral analysis\n\nThe physical processes behind the formation of stellar spectra are well enough understood to permit determinations of temperatures, densities, and chemical compositions of stellar atmospheres. The star studied most extensively is, of course, the Sun, but many others also have been investigated in detail.\n\nThe general characteristics of the spectra of stars depend more on temperature variations among the stars than on their chemical differences. Spectral features also depend on the density of the absorbing atmospheric matter, and density in turn is related to a star's surface gravity. Dwarf stars, with great surface gravities, tend to have high atmospheric densities; giants and supergiants, with low surface gravities, have relatively low densities. Hydrogen absorption lines provide a case in point. Normally, an undisturbed atom radiates a very narrow line. If its energy levels are perturbed by charged particles passing nearby, it radiates at a wavelength near its characteristic wavelength. In a hot gas, the range of disturbance of the hydrogen lines is very high, so that the spectral line radiated by the whole mass of gas is spread out considerably; the amount of blurring depends on the density of the gas in a known fashion. Dwarf stars such as Sirius show broad hydrogen features with extensive \"wings\" where the line fades slowly out into the background, while supergiant stars, with less-dense atmospheres, display relatively narrow hydrogen"}

{"text": "\"Liberator\" Link to Original SourceSternisheFan writes \"The Christian Science Monitor: Pete Spotts reports:\nNew observations of a bridge of tenuous hydrogen gas stretching between two nearby galaxies may help solve a longstanding puzzle: Billions of years after star formation peaked in the universe, what continues to fuel the formation of new stars in spiral galaxies like the Milky Way.\n\nNewly published radiotelescope observations of this segment of what researchers have dubbed the \"cosmic web\" reveal that about half of the neutral hydrogen gas in the bridge is contained in rotating clumps the size of dwarf galaxies. Neutral hydrogen \u2013 atoms with one proton and one electron \u2013 represents the raw material for new stars.\n\n\"If this gas is being accreted by the galaxies, then we need to understand how they're doing that. That information could, in principle, help us understand how galaxies like Andromeda, like our own Milky Way, can acquire gas to form new stars,\" says Spencer Wolfe, a PhD candidate in astronomy at West Virginia University and the lead scientist on the project.\n\nOver the past decade, astronomers have come to appreciate the potential of gas between galaxies to provide fresh fuel for making stars in spiral galaxies.\n\nStar formation in the universe appears to have peaked some 10 billion to 11 billion years ago. Stellar birthrates these days are less than 10 percent of what they were then, notes Robert Braun, an astronomer at the Australia Telescope National Facility in Epping, New South Wales.\n\nLeft to their own devices, galaxies have on average about 1 billion to 2 billion years worth of gas in the cosmic tank, a condition that has existed throughout most of the universe's history, Dr. Braun writes in an e-mail. Many of them, therefore, should have stopped forming stars billions of years ago. Moreover, the total mass of stars in the universe today is about five times higher than the amount of neutral hydrogen available 12 billion years ago, suggesting that the universe's larger inventory of ionized hydrogen kept star formation going in some way.\n\nResearchers have identified other mechanisms for the galactic equivalent of in-flight refueling. For instance, gas gets recycled for a time through successive generations of stars. Collisions, mergers, and even near-misses between galaxies can trigger bursts of star formation. But filaments of ionized hydrogen appear to be the only features persistent enough to keep galaxies stocked with stars over billions of years of cosmic history. Somehow, within those filaments, enough of the ionized gas condenses into the neutral form to serve as new stellar nurseries.\n\nThe filament or bridge Mr. Wolfe and his team studied appears between the Milky Way's nearest neighbor, the Andromeda Galaxy, and the Triangulum Galaxy. Andromeda is some 2.5 million light-years from Earth, while the Triangulum is roughly 3 million light-years away.\n\nThe presence of neutral hydrogen in the bridge was first reported in 2004 and confirmed in follow-up observations published last year. But it's fiendishly difficult to detect. One way neutral hydrogen betrays its presence is via radio waves, with a tell-tale signal at about the same frequency that a typical cell-phone uses. But the clumps are so wispy that their radio emissions were too faint for detailed studies with the radio telescopes used in the early workOnce again, prison is to isolate dangerous people from the rest of society, not for harmless fraudsters.\n\nharmless fraudsters?\n\nIn Dante's Inferno, Fraud is the 2nd most serious sin:\n\nCircle 1: Limbo\n\nCircle 2: Lust\n\nCircle 3: Gluttony\n\nCircle 4: Greed\n\nCircle 5: Anger\n\nCircle 6: Heresy\n\nCircle 7: Violence\n\nCircle 8: Fraud\n\nCircle 9: Treachery\n\nIt's worthwhile considering why he thought that way.

{"text": "Herbig-Haro objects are small patches of nebulosity associated with newly-born stars, and are formed when gas ejected by young stars collides with clouds of gas and dust nearby at speeds of several hundred kilometres per second. Herbig-Haro objects are ubiquitous in star-forming regions, and several are often seen around a single star, aligned along its rotational axis.\n\nHH objects are transient phenomena, lasting only a few thousand years at most. They can evolve visibly over quite short timescales as they move rapidly away from their parent star into the gas clouds in interstellar space (the interstellar medium or ISM). Hubble Space Telescope observations reveal complex evolution of HH objects over a few years, as parts of them fade while others brighten as they collide with clumpy material in the interstellar medium.\n\nThe objects were first observed in the late 19th century by Sherburne Wesley Burnham, but were not recognised as being a distinct type of emission nebula until the 1940s. The first astronomers to study them in detail were George Herbig and Guillermo Haro, after whom they have been named. Herbig and Haro were working independently on studies of star formation when they first analysed Herbig-Haro objects, and recognised that they were a by-product of the star formation process.\n\nDiscovery and history of observations\n\nThe first Herbig-Haro object was observed in the late 19th century by Burnham, when he looked at the star T Tauri with the 36-inch refracting telescope at Lick Observatory and noted a small patch of nebulosity nearby. However, it was catalogued merely as an emission nebula, later becoming known as Burnham's Nebula, and was not recognised as a distinct class of object. However, T Tauri was found to be a very young and variable star, and is the prototype of the class of similar objects known as T Tauri stars which have yet to reach a state of hydrostatic equilibrium between gravitational collapse and energy generation through nuclear fusion at their centres.\n\nFifty years after Burnham's discovery, several similar nebulae were discovered which were so small as to be almost star-like in appearance. Both Haro and Herbig made independent observations of several of these objects during the 1940s. Herbig also looked at Burnham's Nebula and found that it displayed an unusual electromagnetic spectrum, with prominent emission lines of hydrogen, sulphur and oxygen. Haro found that all the objects of this type were invisible in infrared light.\n\nFollowing their independent discoveries, Herbig and Haro met at an astronomy conference in Tucson, Arizona. Herbig had initially paid little attention to the objects he had discovered, being primarily concerned with the nearby stars, but on hearing Haro's findings he carried out more detailed studies of them. The Soviet astronomer Viktor Ambartsumian gave the objects their name, and based on their occurrence near young stars (a few hundred thousand years old), suggested that they might represent an early stage in the formation of T Tauri stars.\n\nStudies showed that HH objects were highly ionised, and early theorists speculated that they might contain low-luminosity hot stars. However, the absence of infrared radiation from the nebulae meant there could not be stars within them, as these would have emitted abundant infrared light. Later studies suggested that the nebulae might contain protostars, but eventually HH objects came to be understood as material ejected by nearby young stars, and colliding at supersonic speeds with the interstellar medium (ISM), with the resulting shock waves generating visible light [1].\n\nIn the early 1980s, observations revealed for the first time the jet-like nature of most HH objects. This led to the understanding that the material ejected to form HH objects is highly collimated (concentrated into narrow jets). Stars are often surrounded by accretion disks in their first few hundred thousand years of existence, which form as gas falls onto them, and the rapid rotation of the inner parts of these disks leads to the emission of narrow jets of partially ionizedplasma perpendicular to the disk, known as polar jets. When these jets collide with the interstellar medium, they give rise to the small patches of bright emission which comprise HH objects [2].\n\nPhysical characteristics\n\nHH objects HH1 and HH2 lie about a light year apart, symmetrically opposite a young star which is ejecting material along its polar axis\n\nEmission from HH objects is caused by shock waves when they collide with the interstellar medium, but their motions are complicated. Spectroscopic observations of their doppler shifts indicate velocities of several hundred kilometres per second, but the emission lines in the spectra of HH objects are too weak to have been formed in such high speed collisions. This probably means that some of the material they are colliding with is also moving outwards, although at a slower speed [3].\n\nThe total mass being ejected to form typical HH objects is estimated to be of the order of 1\u201320 Earth-masses, a very small amount of material compared to the mass of the stars themselves [4]. The temperatures observed in HH objects are typically about 8000\u201312,000 K, similar to those found in other ionized nebulae such as H II regions and planetary nebulae. They tend to be quite dense, with densities ranging from a few thousand to a few tens of thousands of particles per cm\u00b3, compared to generally less than 1000/cm\u00b3 in H II regions and planetary nebulae [5]. HH objects consist mostly of hydrogen and helium, which account for about 75% and 25% respectively of their mass. Less than 1% of the mass of HH objects is made up of heavier chemical elements, and the abundances of these are generally similar to those measured in nearby young stars[4].\n\nNear to the source star, about 20\u201330% of the gas in HH objects is ionised, but this proportion decreases at increasing distances. This implies that the material is ionised in the polar jet, and recombines as it moves away from the star, rather than being ionised by later collisions. Shocking at the end of the jet can re-ionise some material, however, giving rise to bright \"caps\" at the ends of the jets.\n\nNumbers and distribution\n\nOver 400 individual HH objects or groups are now known. They are ubiquitous in star-forming H II regions, and are often found in large groups. They are typically observed near Bok globules (dark nebulae which contain very young stars) and often emanate from them. Frequently, several HH objects are seen near a single energy source, forming a string of objects along the line of the polar axis of the parent star.\n\nThe number of known HH objects has increased rapidly over the last few years, but is still thought to be a very small proportion of the total number existing in our galaxy. Estimates suggest that up to 150,000 exist [6], the vast majority of which are too far away to be resolved with current technological capabilities. Most HH objects lie within 0.5 parsecs of their parent star, with very few found more than 1 pc away. However, some are seen several parsecs away, perhaps implying that the interstellar medium is not very dense in their vicinity, allowing them to travel further from their source before dispersing.\n\nProper motions and variability\n\nImages taken over five years reveal the motion of material in HH object HH47. view detail.\n\nSpectroscopic observations of HH objects show that they are moving away from the source stars at speeds of 100 to 1000 km/s. In recent years, the high optical resolution of Hubble Space Telescope observations has revealed the proper motion of many HH objects in observations spaced several years apart. These observations have also allowed estimates of the distances of some HH objects via the expansion parallax method.\n\nAs they move away from the parent star, HH objects evolve significantly, varying in brightness on timescales of a few years. Individual knots within an object may brighten and fade or disappear entirely, while new knots have been seen to appear. As well as changes caused by interactions with the ISM, interactions between jets moving at different speeds within HH objects also cause variations.\n\nThe eruption of jets from the parent stars occurs in pulses rather than as a steady stream. The pulses may produce jets of gas moving in the same direction but at different speeds, and interactions between different jets create so-called \"working surfaces\", where streams of gases collide and generate shock waves.\n\nSource stars\n\nHerbig-Haro object HH32 is one of the brightest HH objects\n\nThe stars which are behind the creation of Herbig-Haro objects are all very young stars, the youngest of which are still protostars in the process of forming from the surrounding gases. Astronomers divide these stars into classes 0, I, II and III, according to how much infrared radiation the stars give off [7]. A greater amount of infrared radiation implies a larger amount of cooler material surrounding the star, which indicates that it is still coalescing. The numbering of the classes arises because class 0 objects (the youngest) were not discovered until classes I, II and III had already been defined.\n\nClass 0 objects are only a few thousand years old, so young that they are not yet undergoing nuclear fusion reactions at their centres. Instead, they are powered only by the gravitational potential energy released as material falls onto them [8]. Nuclear fusion has begun in the cores of Class I objects, but gas and dust are still falling onto their surfaces from the surrounding nebula. They are generally still shrouded in dense clouds of dust and gas, which obscure all their visible light and mean that they can only be observed at infrared and radio wavelengths. Infall of gas and dust has largely finished in Class II objects, but they are still surrounded by disks of dust and gas, while class III objects have only trace remnants of their original accretion disk.\n\nStudies have shown that about 80% of the stars giving rise to HH objects are in fact binary or multiple systems (two or more stars orbiting each other), which is a much higher proportion than that found for low mass stars on the main sequence. This may indicate that binary systems are more likely to generate the jets which give rise to HH objects, and evidence suggests that the largest HH outflows might be formed when multiple systems disintegrate. It is thought that most stars form as multiple systems, but that a sizable fraction are disrupted before they reach the main sequence, by gravitational interactions with nearby stars and dense clouds of gas [9].\n\nInfrared counterparts\n\nHerbig-Haro (HH) objects associated with very young stars or very massive protostars are often hidden from view at optical wavelengths by the cloud of gas and dust from which they form. This surrounding natal material can produce tens or even hundreds of magnitudes of extinction at optical wavelengths. Such deeply embedded objects can only be observed at infrared or radio wavelengths [10], usually in the light of hot molecular hydrogen or warm carbon monoxide emission.\n\nIn recent years, infrared images have revealed dozens of examples of \"infrared HH objects\". Most look like bow waves (similar to the waves at the head of a sailing ship), and so are usually referred to as molecular \"bow shocks\". Like HH objects, these supersonic shocks are driven by collimated jets from the two poles of a protostar. They sweep up or \"entrain\" the surrounding dense molecular gas to form a continuous flow of material, which is referred to as a Bipolar outflow. Infrared bow shocks travel at hundreds of kilometers per second, heating gas to hundreds or even thousands of degrees. Because they are associated with the youngest stars, where accretion is particularly strong, infrared bow shocks are usually associated with more powerful jets than their optical HH cousins.\n\nThe physics of infrared bow shocks can be understood in much the same way as that of HH objects, since these objects are essentially the same - it is only the conditions in the jet and surrounding cloud that are different, causing infrared emission from molecules rather than optical emission from atoms and ions [11].\n\nSee also\n\nnebula (from Latin: \"mist\" [1] ; pl. nebulae or nebul\u00e6, with ligature) is an interstellar cloud of dust, hydrogen gas and plasma.

{"text": "way to weigh giant black holes\n\nWednesday, July 16, 2008\n\nA composite image from NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory (shown in purple) and Hubble Space Telescope (blue) shows the giant elliptical galaxy NGC 4649. By applying a new technique, scientists used Chandra data to measure the black hole at its center to be about 3.4 billion times more massive than the Sun. The value from this X-ray technique is consistent with a more traditional method using the motions of stars near the black hole. NGC 4649 is now one of only a handful of galaxies for which the mass of a supermassive black hole has been measured with two different methods. (Credit: X-ray: NASA/CXC/Univ. of California Irvine/P.Humphrey et al.; Optical: NASA/STScI)\n\nHow do you weigh the biggest black holes in the universe? One answer now comes from a completely new and independent technique that astronomers have developed using data from NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory.\n\nBy measuring a peak in the temperature of hot gas in the center of the giant elliptical galaxy NGC 4649, scientists have determined the mass of the galaxy's supermassive black hole. The method, applied for the first time, gives results that are consistent with a traditional technique.\n\nAstronomers have been seeking out different, independent ways of precisely weighing the largest supermassive black holes, that is, those that are billions of times more massive than the Sun. Until now, methods based on observations of the motions of stars or of gas in a disk near such large black holes had been used.\n\n\"This is tremendously important work since black holes can be elusive, and there are only a couple of ways to weigh them accurately,\" said Philip Humphrey of the University of California at Irvine, who led the study. \"It's reassuring that two very different ways to measure the mass of a big black hole give such similar answers.\"\n\nNGC 4649 is now one of only a handful of galaxies for which the mass of a supermassive black hole has been measured with two different methods. In addition, this new X-ray technique confirms that the supermassive black hole in NGC 4649 is one of the largest in the local universe with a mass about 3.4 billion times that of the Sun, about a thousand times bigger than the black hole at the center of our galaxy.\n\nThe new technique takes advantage of the gravitational influence the black hole has on the hot gas near the center of the galaxy. As gas slowly settles towards the black hole, it gets compressed and heated. This causes a peak in the temperature of the gas right near the center of the galaxy. The more massive the black hole, the bigger the temperature peak detected by Chandra.\n\nThis effect was predicted by two of the co-authors -- Fabrizio Brighenti from the University of Bologna, Italy, and William Mathews from the University of California at Santa Cruz -- almost 10 years ago, but this is the first time it has been seen and used.\n\n\"It was wonderful to finally see convincing evidence of the effects of the huge black hole that we expected,\" said Brighenti. \"We were thrilled that our new technique worked just as well as the more traditional approach for weighing the black hole.\"\n\nThe black hole in NGC 4649 is in a state where it does not appear to be rapidly pulling in material towards its event horizon, nor generating copious amounts of light as it grows. So, the presence and mass of the central black hole has to be studied more indirectly by tracking its effects on stars and gas surrounding it. This technique is well suited to black holes in this condition.\n\n\"Monster black holes like this one power spectacular light shows in the distant, early universe, but not in the local universe,\" said Humphrey. \"So, we can't wait to apply our new method to other nearby galaxies harboring such inconspicuous black holes"}
{"text": "Thursday, April 12, 2012\n\n1204.2455 (Luigi Iapichino et al.)\n\nMerger shocks induce turbulence in the intra-cluster medium (ICM), and, under some circumstances, accelerate electrons to relativistic velocities to form so-called radio relics. Relics are mostly found at the periphery of galaxy clusters and appear to have magnetic fields at the microGauss level. Here we investigate the possible origins of these magnetic fields. Turbulence produced by the shock itself cannot explain the magnitude of these fields. However, we argue that if the turbulent pressure support in the ICM upstream of the merger shock is of the order of 10 to 30 percent of the total pressure on scales of a few times 100 kpc, then vorticity generated by compressive and baroclinic effects across the shock discontinuity can lead to a sufficient amplification of the magnetic field. Compressional amplification can explain the large polarisation of the radio emission more easily than dynamo turbulent amplification. Finally, clumping of the ICM is shown to have a negligible effect on magnetic field amplification"}

They used a new X-ray survey to determine\nwhat region is winning the tug-of-war: a massive association of galaxies\nover 500 million light-years away. The study shows that our galaxy's journey\nthrough space is not entirely due to the pull of nearby galaxies, but is\nalso affected by much farther regions of the Universe than previously thought.\n\nIfA graduate student Dale D. Kocevski spearheaded the study. He worked\nwith IfA astronomers Harald Ebeling and Brent Tully, and with Chris Mullis,\nan IfA alumnus who is now a research fellow at the University of Michigan.\n\nAstronomers have long known that the Milky Way is moving toward the constellation\nCentaurus at a speed of 1.4 million mph, but the reason for the movement\nremained a topic of debate. Over 20 years ago, it was suggested that the\nmotion was due to the gravitational pull of a nearby large concentration\nof matter dubbed the Great Attractor. The Great Attractor is what is known\nas a supercluster, that is, a group of clusters of galaxies, and was estimated\nto contain matter equal to more than over 10 million billion times the\nmass of the Sun.\n\nUntil now, efforts to find the Great Attractor were hampered by its location\nin the \"zone of avoidance,\" an area behind the plane of the Milky\nWay where gas and dust within our galaxy block much of the visible light\nfrom objects outside it. The new survey, Clusters in the Zone of Avoidance\n(CIZA), is the first to search for the X-ray signatures of galaxy clusters\nbehind the Milky Way and investigate the nature of the Great Attractor.\nDue to the difficulty of observing through the Milky Way, this region was\nthe final portion of the sky in which the cluster population had yet to\nbe mapped.\n\n\"X-rays can penetrate even regions that are extremely obscured by\ngas and dust, and galaxy clusters are sources of X-rays. This is what prompted\nus to attempt to map the distribution of galaxy clusters behind the plane\nof the Milky Way using X-ray observations,\" explains Ebeling, who\ninitiated the survey in 1998.\n\nKocevski and collaborators found far fewer massive cluster systems near\nthe Great Attractor than would be expected given the region's proposed\nmass. \"One of our goals was to uncover the true mass of the Great\nAttractor. What we found is that it is not that great after all,\" says\nKocevski.\n\nInstead, a significant concentration of galaxies behind the Great Attractor\nis tugging on our galaxy. This distant area, which is four times more distant\nthan the Great Attractor region, is dominated by the Shapley Supercluster,\nthe most massive association of galaxies in the observable Universe. Kocevski\nhas determined that only 44 percent of our galaxy's motion through space\nis due to the pull of galaxies in the Great Attractor region. The rest\nis the result of a large-scale flow in which much of the local Universe,\nincluding perhaps the Great Attractor itself, is being pulled toward the\nShapley Supercluster."}

Although the text is original material, the\nvisuals were all found over the web.\n\nGravitational lensing refers to how light travel\nis modified by the presence of mass. The idea is that in empty space,\nlight travels in a straight line, BUT is deflected from a straight line\nwhen traveling past a body of mass. (When that body of mass is a black\nhole, and if the light passes close enough, this deflection is \"catastrophic\"\nin that the light can pass into the black hole never to get out again.)\n\nActually, it is more accurate to say that light always travels in a straight\nline (or rather, follows the shortest path between two points) and it is\nspace itself that becomes distorted by the presence of mass so as to make\nit appear that light moves along a curved path. This next figure illustrates\nthe point.\n\nNow every body of mass can contribute to the deflection of light. However,\nit turns out that light is fast and gravity is weak! Substantial lensing\nrequires the close passage of light to a significant concentration of mass.\n\nExamples of lensing have become almost commonplace in astronomy, not because\nsignificant lensing itself is so common, but rather because there are\nso many sources and intervening bodies of mass, and because technology\nis such that we can now monitor large numbers of sources and are capable\nof seeing distant faint objects. On the whole it is pretty hard work!\n\nA nice example of strong lensing is given in the following image that\nwas taken by the Hubble Space Telescope. The \"lens\" consists of the\ncluster of bright galaxies. The galaxies are the bright, generally\nround objectsexample of strong lensing is given in the following image\nthat was taken by the Hubble Space Telescope. The \"lens\" consists of\nthe cluster of bright galaxies. The galaxies are the bright, generally\nround objects. What is being lensed are other more distant galaxies\nthat lie behind this cluster (perhaps 5 to 10 times more distant).\nThe gravitational lensing leads to the fainter and elongated \"streaks\"\n(like arcs), which are the distorted images of these distant galaxies.\n\nSo how are we to think of this lensing? What is the light doing?\nThe next two figures illustrate the trajectory taken by light when it is\nlensed, in the first case where the observer, lens, and distant source all\nlined up, and in the second case where the alignment is not quite perfect.\n\nIn the first case, the image of the distant source is distorted into a\nperfect ring. In the second two arc-like images are produced.\n\nWhat happens if the arrangement evolves? Nothing in the Universe is sitting\nstill - everything moves. For the example of the cluster of galaxies above,\nthe distances are so large that the arrangement will not change much in\nour lifetime (or many lifetimes!). However, lensing does occur in the\nvicinity of our galaxy, involving a stellar source and some other body\nof matter acting as a lens. In this case the alignment can vary significantly\nover weeks and months. The following shows how the lensing changes over\ntime, with the lens as the dark point at the middle, taken as fixed, and\nthe source a more distant star shown as an open circle that tracks from\nleft to right.\n\nTwo images are produced, shown as filled dark ovals. The two are oppositely\noriented about the lens and source, such that the images, the lens, and\nthe star all line up (an example line is provided). The dashed circle is the\n\"Einstein radius\". If everything were perfectly aligned, the image of the\nstar would appear as a ring of brightness along this circle.\n\nAlthough this picture is correct, this kind of lensing involves masses\nlike that of stars instead of galaxies, and separation of the two images\ndepends on the mass. Since the masses are relatively small, the images\nare relatively close, too close to be observed distinctly with telescopes.\n\nAlthough the separate images cannot be discerned in this case, the brightness\nof the distant source does change, in particular it brightens or is\namplified. This kind of lensing is called \"microlensing\". The following\nlight curve, in blue and red light, shows how microlensing causes\na star to brighten for a time (the lower axis is in days, and the\nvertical is an amplification factor, for which \"1\" means no lensing).\n\nHere is another example of a light curve from microlensing.\n\nIn this case a ratio of the of the blue and red amplifications is also shown.\nA characteristic of true microlensing, instead of some other stellar\nvariability, is that lensing does not depend on the type of light (well,\nat least in the simple case), thus the ratio of amplifications for different\ncolors should always be one.\n\nThe following graph shows lightcurves for many microlensing candidates that\nwere observed in the direction of the Galactic Bulge, all overplotted\nto show the range of lensing durations.\n\nThe following illustration shows the three main microlensing survey efforts in\nour \"neighborhood\".\n\nConcerted efforts to monitor multiple millions\nof stars have resulted in only upwards of 1000 microlensing events.\nA lot of events to be sure, but requiring an immense observational\nand organizational expense!\n\nSo gravitational lensing has become an important area of study in astrophysics,\nboth in our galaxy in reference to the problem of \"Dark Matter\" and in\nexplorations of the Universe as a whole.\n\nThe following\nlink\nprovides some animations of lensing by Dr S.

{"text": "Scientists from UC Berkley's Supernova Cosmology Project are announcing the discovery of the oldest supernova yet, having located it with the Hubble Space telescope at a distance of 10 billion light years. This discovery will provide astronomers with added data that may help them to solve one of the universe's greatest mysteries.\n\nThe glowing gas and dust remnants of a type IA supernova are seen in this false-color image.\n\nLOS ANGELES, CA (Catholic Online) - The ancient supernova occurred some 10 billion years ago, long before the formation of the Sun and Earth. However because it is so distant, it has taken 10 billion years for its light to reach us. That fact may provide astronomers with an important clue they can use to solve a perplexing mystery.\n\nAstronomers know the universe is expanding in all directions, simultaneously, much like a balloon being inflated. Edwin Hubble discovered this in the 1920s when he studied the light from distant galaxies and found they were receding from us.\n\nWhat astronomers recently discovered, and now poses one of the greatest mysteries, is that this rate of expansion is accelerating rather than slowing down or holding constant.\n\nAstronomers compare this to an explosion that become more violent as it continues, rather than slowing down. It is a counter-intuitive mystery they are yet to solve.\n\nHowever, both astronomers and physicists are working quite hard to unravel the mystery. One way astronomers can contribute is to measure distant objects. Certain types of supernovas, known as type IA supernovae, are excellent objects for astronomers to measure because they are uniformly bright.\n\nA supernova is the explosive death of a star that occurs when a star has used all of the hydrogen fuel in its core and no longer has enough fuel to continue shining. The breakdown of atomic fusion in its core causes the outer shell of the star to collapse which in turn causes a uniform explosion in all directions. Stars of different masses produce different kinds of explosions, but type IA supernovas are uniform and equally bright in all directions. This allows them to be used to make precise measurements of distance.\n\nAstronomers refer to them as \"standard candles\" since they serve as one of the several well-understood objects that can be accurately measured.\n\nWhen the Berkeley astronomers found a Type IA supernovae 10 billion light-years distant, they knew they had an incredible find. The find now allows them to measure the distance to the object which they can compare to the expansion rate of the universe to create a data point. That data point can then be used to compare various theories of expansion and evaluate which ones serve to best account for the expansion rate of the universe.\n\nIn all, it's just a little more information than they had before. The team hopes to discover and measure several other similar objects to create a database of information that may help cosmologists settle on the mathematical model which best explains the accelerating universe.\n\nFor now, the mystery remains, but today, it's one step closer to being solvedJerry N\n\n4 months ago\n\n\"...type IA supernovas are uniform and equally bright in all directions. This allows them to be used to make precise measurements of distance.\"\n\nThis \"equal brightness\" is a basic assumption on which \"precise\" (but not necessarily accurate) estimates of cosmic distances depend. Unfortunately, it is an assumption that cannot easily be proven true, and if it turns out to be false, then the \"universe expansion is accelerating \" theory gets blown out of the water. Despite all of our technological sophistication, many of today's cosmological theories still rely on unproven assumptions such as this"}
{"text": "This month marks the tenth anniversary of one of the best ideas to come out of modern astronomy: the Hubble Heritage project. Astronomers at the Space Telescope Science Institute knew that Hubble was taking fantastic images that the public weren't seeing, because Hubble was taking them faster than they could release to the press. So they decided that on the first Thursday of each month they would release a gorgeous picture online.\n\nFor their tenth anniversary*, they present this beautiful image of detail in the nebula NGC 3324:\n\nCooool. But what is it?\n\nIt's a cavity several light years across, carved out by the fierce light and intense stellar winds from a group of young, massive, hot stars that are out of the frame (\"up\", if you will). This whole part of the sky, in the direction of Carina, is lousy with dust and gas. There are star-forming regions all over the place. Stars of all masses are born, from dinky brown dwarfs with less than 1/10th the Sun's mass, up to bruising monsters 80 times the mass of the Sun. The massive stars are incredibly hot, and blow off a dense and fast wind of material which pushes against their nursery cocoon.\n\nThe fingers of NGC 3324\n\nThe result is a sharp-edged bubble of material. Inside is thin hot gas (colored blue in this image), and outside is thicker dust and gas (reds and browns). See the little pseudopods sticking in around the edges? Those are formed where you get denser blobs just inside the cavity edge. Note that the winds and light are streaming \"down\" in this image. When that flows past the blobs you get those finger-like sandbars. When you zoom in on them, they look a lot like the trunks in the Pillars of Creation Hubble image or the Spitzer image of nebula W5. If you look carefully in that zoom above, you can see lots of these features scattered around the cavity's edge.\n\nThe whole NGC 3324 complex. See? It's a bubble!\n\nZooming out is useful, too. In the picture to the right you can see the overall bubble shape to the nebula, and the stars near the center that are sculpting this vast cavern. The Hubble image is of the section to the upper right of the cavity, from about 1:00 to 3:00 if the circle were a clock face. But you can see amazing features all around the edges.\n\nHubble is having its woes right now, and even if it gets fixed its own clock is ticking. It was launched in April 1990 \u2014 I still remember it well, as I had just signed up to use it for my PhD project \u2014 and nothing lasts forever. But Hubble has taken thousands upon thousands of observations, all of which have been stored away. And while Hubble may eventually be shut off, the images, spectra, and other data it's taken will live on. Astronomers a century from now will be digging through the archives, looking for an elusive supernova, a feature of a nebula that's changed in the intervening years, the positions of stars in globular clusters, and the colors of galaxies so far away that when the light Hubble detected left them, the Earth was still a cooling ball of molten rock.\n\nDiamond anniversaries come and go, but the treasures Hubble has unveiled will still be around a long, long time. Congratulations to my friends at the Hubble Heritage Project. Thanks for bringing us these jewels in the sky.\n\n*Technically and traditionally, the tenth anniversary gift should be tin, but in modern times it's common to give diamondsIt's also neat to realize why it's not just round. It's not just because there are variations in the density of the interstellar medium \u2013 there's a fluid-dynamical process (the \"Rayleigh-Taylor instability\") that you can demonstrate at home that ensures that small irregularities balloon into the wonderful exotic shapes we seeAlthough you might see it as a fuzzy cloud, it is unlikely for the fine detail we see in this image to be visible to the unaided eye. This is because the gas, while relatively dense, is still very, very rarefied. Some nebulae have a lower gas density than what would be considered a fairly hard vacuum in a lab on Earth. Hubble images almost all result from quite long exposures \u2013 this one was probably at least several minutes, if not over an hour.\n\nCelestial objects such as this nebula are faint. Even through a medium-sized telescope, most nebulae appear to the human eye as no more than a little faint fuzzy patch.\n\nA very big thankyou to the folks who designed, built and are using the Hubble Space telscope, a big thankyou to the people at NASA and their astronauts for fixing and updating it (several times over) and thankyou Dr Phil Plait for telling us about it so clearly and so well."}

(NASA)\n\n\"Although dark energy accounts for more than 70 per cent of the energy of the universe, we know very little about it, so each clue is precious,\" he said in a NASA release.\n\nThe finding that dark energy has existed for most of the universe's history will help scientists by ruling out a competing explanation that held that the force changed over time.\n\nAstrophysicists are particularly interested in two of dark energy's fundamental properties: its strength and its permanence.\n\nThe new observations show it was present and countering the force of gravity long before dark energy began to force the universe apart.\n\nPrevious Hubble observations show that gravity was slowing the expansion of the universe. But the expansion rate began to speed up about five to six billion years ago, when dark energy's repulsive force overcame gravity's attraction, astronomers believe.\n\nHubble studied dark energy by looking at the behavior of the 24 most distant supernovae, most found in the past two years. The supernovae, stars that exploded eons ago, are too far away to be studied by ground-based telescopes.\n\nThe change in supernovae can be used to trace the universe's expansion, NASA said, likening them to the marks parents make on a door frame to measure a child's growth.\n\nThe Hubble observations are consistent with a prediction made nearly a century ago by Albert Einstein. He thought there must be energy coming from empty space forcing the universe apart, or else gravity would cause the universe to collapse on itself.\n\nEinstein's \"cosmological constant\" was only a hypothesis until 1998, when Riess and others figured out that space was expanding at an increasing rate, based on supernovae observations"}
{"text": "Friday, August 05, 2011 The Milky Way's Supermassive Black Hole Supermassive black holes - objects with masses of millions or even billions of suns - are found at the nuclei of galaxies. Our Milky Way\ngalaxy, for example, has a massive black hole at its core, albeit one that is relatively quiescent. Despite their reputation for being implacable sinks for matter and energy, both radiation and matter can be ejected from the vicinity of a black hole, often in powerful jets, when it is ringed by a disk of matter and material accretes onto it. Thus in dramatic cases, like quasars, nuclear black holes are responsible for some of the most spectacular phenomena in the cosmos.\n\nA black hole is so simple that it can be completely described by only three parameters: its mass, its spin, and its electric charge. The\nsupermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way, because it is example closest to us, has been a prime target for study by scientists\ntrying to measure these parameters and understand how they influence the behavior of the region. For example, why it is that our black hole is so quiescent, while bright jets and luminous emission are seen in more dramatic cases?\n\nCfA astronomer Avi Loeb, his recent student Avery Broderick, and two colleagues have modeled the nature of the Milky Way's black hole. The mass has been estimated by other scientists who, by watching the motions\nof stars in its vicinity, find that it is about 4.3 million solar-masses. (The charge of the black hole remains unknown.) The CfA team used results from ultra-high spatial resolution millimeter wavelength astronomy to measure the angular size of the weak emission around the black hole; the equipment has an angular precision roughly equivalent to seeing a dime on the moon. Based on their analysis of the data, they find that the Milky Way's central black hole spin is at best modest - although whether this explains why the emission is weak is still uncertain. They also conclude that the millimeter emission is slightly extended - it has an axis ratio of about 2.3, but the orientation does not appear to align with any other known features. Not least, their models strongly suggest that the emission comes from some kind of an accretion process. The new result is just the opening salvo that indicates astronomy has entered an epoch in which it will be able to study black hole physics directly using high spatial resolution techniques."}
{"text": "First galaxies were born much earlier than expected [heic1106]\n\n12 Apr 2011\n\nUsing the amplifying power of a cosmic gravitational lens, astronomers have discovered a distant galaxy whose stars were born unexpectedly early in cosmic history. This result sheds new light on the formation of the first galaxies, as well as on the early evolution of the Universe.\n\nGravitational lensing by Abell 383 allows study of the newly discovered distant galaxy that began forming stars just 200 million years after the Big Bang.\n\nJohan Richard, the lead author of a new study [1] says: \"We have discovered a distant galaxy that began forming stars just 200 million years after the Big Bang. This challenges theories of how soon galaxies formed and evolved in the first years of the Universe. It could even help solve the mystery of how the hydrogen fog that filled the early Universe was cleared.\"\n\nRichard's team spotted the galaxy in recent observations from the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, verified it with observations from the NASA Spitzer Space Telescope and measured its distance using W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii.\n\nThe distant galaxy is visible through a cluster of galaxies called Abell 383, whose powerful gravity bends the rays of light almost like a magnifying glass [2]. The chance alignment of the galaxy, the cluster and the Earth amplifies the light reaching us from this distant galaxy, allowing the astronomers to make detailed observations. Without this gravitational lens, the galaxy would have been too faint to be observed even with today's largest telescopes.\n\nAfter spotting the galaxy in Hubble and Spitzer images, the team carried out spectroscopic observations with the Keck-II telescope in Hawaii. Spectroscopy is the technique of breaking up light into its component colours. By analysing these spectra, the team was able to make detailed measurements of its redshift [3] and infer information about the properties of its component stars.\n\nThe galaxy's redshift is 6.027, which means we see it as it was when the Universe was around 950 million years old [4]. This does not make it the most remote galaxy ever detected - several have been confirmed at redshifts of more than 8, and one has an estimated redshift of around 10 (heic1103), placing it 400 million years earlier. However the newly discovered galaxy has dramatically different features from other distant galaxies that have been observed, which generally shine brightly with only young stars.\n\n\"When we looked at the spectra, two things were clear,\" explains co-author Eiichi Egami. \"The redshift placed it very early in cosmic history, as we expected. But the Spitzer infrared detection also indicated that the galaxy was made up of surprisingly old and relatively faint stars. This told us that the galaxy was made up of stars already nearly 750 million years old - pushing back the epoch of its formation to about 200 million years after the Big Bang, much further than we had expected.\"\n\nCo-author Dan Stark continues: \"Thanks to the amplification of the galaxy's light by the gravitational lens, we have some excellent quality data. Our work confirms some earlier observations that had hinted at the presence of old stars in early galaxies. This suggests that the first galaxies have been around for a lot longer than previously thought.\"\n\nThe discovery has implications beyond the question of when galaxies first formed, and may help explain how the Universe became transparent to ultraviolet light in the first thousand million years after the Big Bang. In the early years of the cosmos, a diffuse fog of neutral hydrogen gas blocked ultraviolet light in the Universe. Some source of radiation must therefore have progressively ionised the diffuse gas, clearing the fog to make it transparent to ultraviolet rays as it is today - a process known as reionisation.\n\nAstronomers believe that the radiation that powered this reionisation must have come from galaxies. But so far, nowhere near enough of them have been found to provide the necessary radiation. This discovery may help solve this enigma.\n\n\"It seems probable that there are in fact far more galaxies out there in the early Universe than we previously estimated - it's just that many galaxies are older and fainter, like the one we have just discovered,\" says co-author Jean-Paul Kneib. \"If this unseen army of faint, elderly galaxies is indeed out there, they could provide the missing radiation that made the Universe transparent to ultraviolet light.\"\n\nAs of today, we can only discover these galaxies by observing through massive clusters that act as cosmic telescopes. In coming years, the NASA/ESA/CSA James Webb Space Telescope, scheduled for launch later this decade, will specialise in high resolution observations of distant, highly redshifted objects. It will therefore be in an ideal position to solve this mystery once and for all.\n\nNotes\n\nThe Hubble Space Telescope is a project of international cooperation between NASA and ESA.\n\n[1] The research will appear in a paper entitled \"Discovery of a possibly old galaxy at z=6.027, multiply imaged by the massive cluster Abell 383\", to be published in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society. The international team of astronomers in this study consists of Johan Richard (CRAL, Observatoire de Lyon, Universit\u00e9 Lyon 1, France and Dark Cosmology Centre, Niels Bohr Institute, University of Copenhagen, Denmark), Jean-Paul Kneib (Laboratoire d'Astrophysique de Marseille, France), Harald Ebeling (University of Hawaii, USA), Daniel P Stark (University of Cambridge, UK), Eiichi Egami (University of Arizona, USA) and Andrew K Fiedler (University of Arizona, USA)\n\n[2] Gravity distorts space-time, the fabric of the cosmos. This means that for extremely massive objects with very strong gravitational fields, light is visibly bent as it travels through and around them. Massive galaxy clusters like Abell 383 therefore act like an enormous lens, concentrating the light from distant objects behind them, in a process known as gravitational lensing. While the galaxies seen through gravitational lenses are typically distorted and multiply imaged (this newly discovered galaxy is actually visible twice in the Hubble observations), using these gravitational lenses multiplies a telescope's power and lets it see galaxies that would otherwise be too faint to be visible. Abell 383, the gravitational lens used in this study, was imaged as part of the CLASH survey (Cluster Lensing And Supernova survey with Hubble), a Multi Cycle Treasury project to observe a sample of 25 galaxy clusters using Hubble (PI: Marc Postman). Abell 383 is also one of the 50 clusters imaged with the Spitzer Warm mission large project led by Eiichi Egami.\n\n[3] Because the Universe is expanding, the light from distant objects is stretched and reddened as it moves towards us, a phenomenon known as redshift. The further an object is away, the more heavily redshifted it is. For very remote objects, redshift can be used to quantify their distance.\n\n[4] Because light travels at a finite speed, the further away an object is, the further back in time we see it. For an object at a redshift of 6, the light has taken around 12.8 thousand million years to travel to Earth. Since we know that the Universe is about 13.75 thousand million years old, this means we are seeing the object in the state it was in less than a thousand million years after the Big Bang. Redshift is therefore a measure of time elapsed since the Big Bang as well as of an object's distance."}

An inner ring of younger stars (light blue) also orbits the black hole. The stellar disks may drag swirling gas close enough to the black hole to be consumed. Credit: A. Field, NASA, ESA.\n\n(PhysOrg.com) -- At the center of most galaxies lie supermassive black holes that can grow to become more than a billion times larger than our Sun. However, astrophysicists don't fully understand the formation and evolution of supermassive black holes - specifically, how swirling gas from the galaxy loses its large angular momentum to allow it to be consumed by the black hole.\n\nIn a new study, astrophysicists Philip Hopkins and Eliot Quataert from the University of California, Berkeley, have proposed an explanation for how gas loses its angular momentum and successfully crosses the last 30 light years to the black hole. Their idea stems from previous observations that the supermassive black hole in the center of the Andromeda galaxy is orbited by an old lopsided stellar disk. Hopkins and Quataert suggest that when gas flows toward a black hole, it initially forms this stellar disk due to gravitational instabilities.\n\nEventually, the stellar disk grows in size to stretch over a distance of dozens of light years from the center of the galaxy. Once it becomes large enough, its eccentric shape pulls unevenly on the incoming gas. This torque causes different gas streams to collide, reducing the gas' momentum and allowing it to flow close enough to the black hole (less than one light year) to allow the black hole's gravity to dominate and swallow the gas. The researchers' simulations showed that this process could enable black holes to consume several solar masses of gas each year, which could have helped Andromeda's black hole to gain much of its mass.\n\nSince Andromeda is not a unique galaxy, other supermassive black holes may also have orbiting stellar disks that transport the angular momentum of gas to the black hole's vicinity, helping to \"feed\" the black hole. In addition, the eccentric stellar disk's self-gravitational forces might reveal insight into active galactic nuclei and the cosmic X-ray background.\n\nMore information: Philip Hopkins and Eliot Quataert. \"The Nuclear Stellar Disk in Andromeda: A Fossil from the Era of Black Hole Growth.\" Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.

Just how many very large galaxies do the authors believe collide in 100,000 years?\n\nWho's Doing The Math?\n\nWed Mar 05 01:44:37 GMT 2008 by Charles\n\nIsn't the number of galaxies in the visible universe of the order of 10^10? If so, for there to be 10^5 of these things visible, would that mean one a collision per year? Or would it? Anyway, someone with a more mathematical background can surely work it out quite easily!\n\nWho's Doing The Math?\n\nThu Mar 06 22:46:42 GMT 2008 by Cyrus\n\nI think it's time you pulled your heads out of your math-holes.\n\nFirst of all, there are 10^10 galaxies in the visible universe, not 10^10 super-massive black holes, as only those galaxies at least as big as the Milky Way are supposed to contain them (assuming they exist at all). Second, the interaction of galaxies do not follow gas laws. Perhaps you haven't been paying attention, but it now known that the universe's galactic superclusters are accelerating away from from each other, whilst the galactic superclusters themselves are, generally speaking, static. Estimating that there is 1 collision annually is ludicrous. If, in the future life of the universe, a single collision of super-massive black holes occured, it would be nothing short of a miracle. Third, maybe you didn't notice, but each super-massive black hole is surrounded by an enormous galaxy of around 10^10 stars. Does anyone really believe that you will see this infrared afterglow through the infrared light given off by all these stars? We can't even see the center of our own galaxy! Finally, if such a collision were to give off more energy than produced by all the visible stars in the observable universe in an instant, as postulated, do you really think any intelligent beings would be left in the universe to view the afterglow?\n\nWho's Doing The Math?\n\nWow, Cyrus, your rudeness is matched only by your impressive ignorance (but isn't that so often the case?).\n\nAs a matter of fact,\n\nYES, all those galaxies are expected to host black holes.\n\nYES, those galaxies and their central black holes collide all the time, especially those in clusters, which are anything but static.\n\nYES, we can easily see the black holes, which in many galaxies are far brighter than all the stars combined (our sun gives off 10^33 ergs/sec, but a quasar shines at 10^46 ergs/sec or more!)\n\nand NO, the energy from such a collision would not kill us all because it is in the form of gravitational waves, which couple only very weakly to matter--that's why they are so hard to see in the first place!\n\nWho's Doing The Math?\n\nNO, super massive black holes do NOT collide all the time. When spiral galaxies interact to form the globular type (which does not happen annually), there are very few actual collisions of bodies, and certainly there is NO evidence of their centers colliding.\n\nNO, we can't \"see\" black holes and NO they are not bright - we only can only surmise their existence by the energy given off by their accretion disks.\n\nNO, just because a quasar outshines our sun, does not imply that the infrared afterglow will outshine the half trillion stars surrounding it.\n\nAnd how can you be so sure that a gravitational wave carrying energy equivalent to all the visible enrgy in the universe won't kill us?"}
{"text": "The universe is constantly being created\u2014and destroyed. It hides nothing. You've seen these colorful, wondrous images of galaxies, nebulae and supernovas before but have you ever wondered how these images are collected? Here's some truth about the process with the most-ess.\n\nFirst of all, a little history to put things in perspective. The first full photograph of planet Earth wasn't captured until 1972, when the Apollo 17 crew left Earth en-route to the moon on December 7th. Since the moon was behind them, they had a perfectly lit view of, well, us! And this photograph was taken so that we can marvel at, well, ourselves!\n\nThe leading photograph shown above is of Spiral Galaxy NGC 3982. To achieve this image as we see it, there's first over 1400 screen captures taken, one every 10 seconds, from the Hubble telescope over the course of 3 weeks. This amounts to 10 hours of processing, beginning with black and white images from 3 Hubble cameras.\n\n\"Creating color images out of the original black-and-white exposures is equal parts art and science\" - hubblesite.org\n\nHubble doesn't use film, it's cameras record light from the universe with special electronic detectors. Finished color images, as we see them, are actually combinations of two or more black and white exposures to which color has been added during images processing. So, not to shatter any or all illusion, but these colorful and dazzling images are not exactly what we would see in outer space with our own eyes. Hubble can detect all the visible wavelengths of light plus many more that are invisible to human eyes, such as ultraviolet and infrared light.\n\nThe images, in order, are Spiral Galaxy NGC 3982 (I personally would have called it something cooler), The Crab Nebula, The Eskimo Nebula, The Helix Nebula, an old star giving up the ghost, The Eagle Nebula, and the last two are the great Carina Nebula."}

This is nearly ten times faster than had ever been seen from a stellar-mass black hole.\n\nA major area of research in X-ray astronomy is the accretion of matter on to black holes and neutron stars in the context of AGN and galactic X-ray binaries.

{"text": "Microquasars Raise Megaquestions\n\nTo uncover the machinery behind galaxy-spanning quasars, astrophysicists are scrutinizing their miniature counterparts--only to find that they pose puzzles of their own\n\nContrary to popular belief, black holes are finicky eaters. Although the voracious billion-solar-mass monsters that power distant quasars can devour the equivalent of one sun per year, they may spit out as much as they swallow.\n\nFor decades, radio astronomers have seen narrow jets streaming out of the centers of quasars and pooling up in vast \"lobes\" that resemble the outstretched ears of an elephant. Despite intense study, however, \"jets have resisted understanding,\" says astrophysicist Jean Swank of the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. What they are made of, why they form, what keeps them going--all are unsettled questions.\n\nThe problem is that quasar jets change very slowly. Although individual blobs in the otherwise smooth jet sometimes appear to travel faster than the speed of light--an optical illusion called superluminal motion, produced when an object travels toward Earth at nearly the speed of light--the jets are very long. A single lobe can be as long as the spiral arm of a galaxy. As a result, it can take decades for astronomers to notice any movement or change in the shape of a quasar jet.\n\nSo Felix Mirabel of France's Atomic Energy Commission (CEA) in Saclay and Luis Rodriguez of the Institute of Astronomy in Morelia, Michoac\u00e1n, Mexico, were thrilled when, in 1994, they spotted a pair of miniature radio jets erupting from a nearby galactic black hole candidate named GRS 1915+105. Like the jets from its grandiose relatives, the newly christened microquasar emitted an occasional blob that raced down the length of the jet at superluminal speeds. In fact, the tightly focused jets were almost exact small-scale replicas of parsec-sized quasar jets, with one crucial difference: They evolved in minutes, not years.\n\n\"Microquasars are an ideal test laboratory for jet formation,\" says Cornell University astrophysicist Stephen Eikenberry. Their appetites whetted, astronomers started avidly hunting for more. Since Mirabel and Rodriguez's discovery, concerted observations from the ground and from space with radio, infrared, optical, x-ray, and gamma ray telescopes have turned up about a dozen objects with the telltale microquasar radio jets.\n\nJust how much microquasars have to say about normal-sized quasars, however, is hotly debated. Do they really hold the key that will unlock the mysteries of jet formation in quasars\u00b7 Or are the apparent similarities just a coincidence\u00b7 Answering these questions is one of the primary goals of a new generation of orbiting x-ray telescopes, including the Chandra X-ray Observatory, the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer, and the European Space Agency's XMM-Newton and Integral satellites.\n\nSome astronomers think the family resemblance will turn out to be spurious. \"So far, nothing we know about quasars has been changed by observing microquasars,\" says Bruce Margon, an astronomer at the University of Washington, Seattle. The black hole that powers a microquasar, Margon notes, is about as massive as a star; the hole in a \"real\" quasar is a billion times larger. \"Very few physical processes scale linearly over nine orders of magnitude,\" he says. The dining habits of the two types of objects also seem to set them apart. Quasar black holes are isolated beasts that feed on hot gas dribbling in from a surrounding cloud. Microquasar black holes are more social: Every known microquasar orbits a windy gas-giant companion star that dumps material into the black hole.\n\nWhatever its source, scientists believe that as gas approaches the central black hole of either a quasar or a microquasar, it collapses into a disk that whirls around the hole in much the same way as the planets orbit the sun. Unlike the planets, however, the viscous gas in a so-called accretion disk gradually loses energy and spirals toward the hole. The lost orbital energy heats the disk, so the temperature of the gas increases the closer it gets to the black hole. As the gas prepares to drop into the black hole, its temperature skyrockets toward almost 1 billion degrees and radiates copious x-rays.\n\nThe jets of a quasar, many theorists suspect, result from the way the gas interacts with the loops of its own magnetic field. The rotating disk winds the field loops like the rubber band in a toy airplane. The magnetic tension increases as the field loops approach the black hole, weaving the loops into magnetic braids that pop out perpendicular to the disk. Hot, radiating gas flows up from the disk and through the braided field lines like water through a pipe, forming the illuminated, magnetized fountains that astronomers call jets.\n\nTheorists think similar scenarios can explain microquasars, with one key difference: Quasar jets appear to be steady and unchanging, whereas microquasar jets are anything but. In GRS 1915+105, for example, approximately every 30 minutes a new blob of radio emission materializes at the base of the jet, accelerates to superluminal speeds, and rockets outward along the jet, fading as it goes. In other microquasars, the light from the jets fluctuates wildly. By comparing radio and x-ray observations of microquasars, astronomers have found evidence that the superluminal blobs and variations in x-ray brightness both result from processes that take place when a microquasar flip-flops between two very different states.\n\n\"The x-rays from accreting black holes in our galaxy come in two distinct forms,\" explains Rob Fender, an astrophysicist at the Astronomical Institute-Anton Pannekoek (AIAP) in Amsterdam. In the so-called high/soft state, the disk shines brightly in low-energy \"soft\" x-rays. As the microquasar enters the low/hard state, on the other hand, the x-rays dim but their spectrum shifts to higher energy \"hard\" x-rays. Now, independent observations by Fender, Eikenberry, Mirabel, and their collaborators indicate that the superluminal radio blobs from GRS 1915+105 form as the microquasar makes that transition. And Michel Tagger, an astrophysicist at the CEA, thinks he can explain why.\n\nA theory developed by Tagger's team and confirmed by computer simulations shows that magnetized accretion disks naturally spawn spiral waves, in much the same way as the Milky Way disk generates spiral arms. In Tagger's model, a microquasar spends part of its time in the high/soft state, during which the waves sweep the magnetic field inward toward the brink of the black hole--the so-called \"innermost stable orbit,\" a mere 100 kilometers from the hole. Closer in, the black hole's gravity grows so strong that nothing can remain in a circular orbit; the accreting gas plunges straight into the hole.\n\nThe magnetic field, however, doesn't follow the doomed matter. Instead, it piles up at the edge of the hole until the increasing tension in the twisted field suddenly snaps it like a rubber band that has been stretched too far. The explosion destroys the soft-x-ray- emitting inner part of the disk, allowing the hard x-rays to shine through and returning the microquasar to the low/hard state. At the same time, the energy of the broken field launches a blob into the jet, as observed in some microquasars. Astrophysicists say that if the theory can be extended to quasars, it might explain the mysterious dichotomy between radio-loud quasars, which emit jets, and the more numerous radio-quiet ones, which have no jets at all. Radio-quiet quasars could simply be in the supermassive equivalent of the high/soft state.\n\nTagger's theory rests on one big assumption. For it to work, the accretion disk must extend all the way down to the innermost stable orbit of the black hole. In the gravitational hurly-burly near a black hole, however, any number of forces could destroy or scatter the gas en route. Does it really reach the crucial 100-kilometer point\u00b7 Tiny variations in the x-ray flux from the microquasars are whispering that the answer might be yes--at least some of the time.\n\nThe gravitational pull of a microquasar black hole forces disk material to orbit the hole approximately 1000 times per second, just as the sun's gravity pulls Earth through one complete revolution every year and makes the planets in tighter orbits speed around much more quickly. A tiny clump of gas in the innermost orbit would hurtle along at nearly the speed of light, and on each pass it would shine a beam of x-rays at Earth like the headlights of a car on a circular track.\n\nIn fact, signals resembling such x-ray \"headlights\" have been detected. Astronomers studying microquasars have measured x-rays that rise and fall at a rate that wanders around a fixed central frequency--sometimes slightly higher, sometimes slightly lower. First discovered in 1985, these quasi- periodic oscillations (QPOs) have now been found in most known microquasars. The typical QPO frequencies are suggestively close to the period expected for a lump of gas in the innermost stable orbit of a black hole. The hitch, so far, is that the orbiting-gas model is only one of many possible explanations of the variations in frequency. Those variations--the \"quasi\" in quasi-periodic--make scientists wary of overinterpreting the results. \"The frequencies of these QPOs are definitely in the right ballpark, but other processes could mimic the effect,\" says AIAP astrophysicist Michiel van der Klis.\n\nAnother test of the magnetic-jet theory is to measure the speed of microquasar jets. Tagger's model predicts that the disk-hole system should spew out material at nearly the speed of light. The superluminal blobs detected in three microquasars fit that picture very well. Calculations show that to create the illusion of faster-than-light travel, those jets must be coursing along at 80% to 90% of light speed, at minimum. The velocity has been measured for only one microquasar, however. \"If we had even one more velocity, we could at least ask the fundamental question: Are all the velocities the same\u00b7\" says Margon. \"Right now, we can't even do that.\"\n\nClocking a jet's speed directly is difficult, because microquasars' distances are poorly known. In principle, exact measurements could come from the jets' light. A stationary hot gas of atoms radiates light at specific frequencies that form bright \"emission lines\" in the spectrum of light from the gas. The emission lines of two oppositely directed high-speed jets of hot gas, however, split into pairs. The same Doppler shift that raises the pitch of an approaching train whistle also increases the frequency of the emission lines from a jet pointed in our direction. The emission lines from the receding jet drop to lower frequencies. The difference in the two Doppler-shifted line frequencies is directly proportional to the jet velocity.\n\nSo far, astronomers have found the revealing line pairs in only one object: SS433. Unfortunately, that reading has just sown more confusion. SS433's emission lines show that the jet streams outward at one-quarter of the speed of light--fast, but not as fast as theory predicts. And there is another problem: Some astronomers suspect that SS433 is an anomalous object that contains not a black hole but a neutron star--\"the worst example\" of a microquasar, Margon says.\n\nHelp may come from Chandra, which has recently turned up encouraging hints of line pairs in several other microquasars. \"We found suggestive evidence for the lines in the microquasar 1E1740.7-2942,\" says astrophysicist Wei Cui of Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana. \"We now have 10 times more telescope time, so we should have a definitive answer next year.\"\n\nUntil that answer comes, researchers can only speculate as to whether microquasars truly are miniature quasars. Dimitrios Psaltis, for one, is beginning to suspect that the answer isn't a simple yes or no. Psaltis, an astrophysicist at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in collaboration with van der Klis and Tomaso Belloni of the AIAP, has found evidence that the pattern of QPOs varies smoothly from neutron stars to black holes. The result suggests that microquasars are not exactly the same as either neutron stars or quasars, but instead form a link in a chain of jet-producing compact objects that extends from stellar-mass neutron stars all the way to the supermassive quasars.\n\nVan der Klis acknowledges that the proposal is tentative and needs further investigation. \"Some say this is just a coincidence, and others build entire theories out of it,\" he says. \"That is just the way it is in this field right now.\""}

The entire sky is plotted in galactocentric coordinates of longitude and latitude. The Magellanic Stream is the pronounced tail of material that stretches 150 degrees Credit: Plot by G. Besla, Milky Way background image by Axel Mellinger (used with permission)\n\n(PhysOrg.com) -- The Magellanic Stream is an arc of hydrogen gas spanning more than 100 degrees of the sky as it trails behind the Milky Way's neighbor galaxies, the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds. Our home galaxy, the Milky Way, has long been thought to be the dominant gravitational force in forming the Stream by pulling gas from the Clouds. A new computer simulation by Gurtina Besla (Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics) and her colleagues now shows, however, that the Magellanic Stream resulted from a past close encounter between these dwarf galaxies rather than effects of the Milky Way.\n\n\"The traditional models required the Magellanic Clouds to complete an orbit about the Milky Way in less than 2 billion years in order for the Stream to form,\" says Besla. Other work by Besla and her colleagues, and measurements from the Hubble Space Telescope by colleague Nitya Kallivaylil, rule out such an orbit, however, suggesting the Magellanic Clouds are new arrivals and not long-time satellites of the Milky Way.\n\nThis creates a problem: How can the Stream have formed without a complete orbit about the Milky Way?\n\nTo address this, Besla and her team set up a simulation assuming the Clouds were a stable binary system on their first passage about the Milky Way in order to show how the Stream could form without relying on a close encounter with the Milky Way.\n\nThe team postulated that the Magellanic Stream and Bridge are similar to bridge and tail structures seen in other interacting galaxies and, importantly, formed before the Clouds were captured by the Milky Way.\n\n\"While the Clouds didn't actually collide,\" says Besla, \"they came close enough that the Large Cloud pulled large amounts of hydrogen gas away from the Small Cloud. This tidal interaction gave rise to the Bridge we see between the Clouds, as well as the Stream.\"\n\n\"We believe our model illustrates that dwarf-dwarf galaxy tidal interactions are a powerful mechanism to change the shape of dwarf galaxies without the need for repeated interactions with a massive host galaxy like the Milky Way.\"\n\nWhile the Milky Way may not have drawn the Stream material out of the Clouds, the Milky Way's gravity now shapes the orbit of the Clouds and thereby controls the appearance of the tail.\n\n\"We can tell this from the line-of-sight velocities and spatial location of the tail observed in the Stream today,\" says team member Lars Hernquist of the Center.\n\nRelated Stories\n\nA giant stream of gas flowing from neighbor galaxies around our own Milky Way is much longer and older than previously thought, astronomers have discovered.

{"text": "The Death of Stars I: Solar-Mass Stars\n\nOur Sun will eventually exhaust its core hydrogen and evolve off the main sequence\ninto a red giant. After the helium flash initiates helium-burning it will move\nonto the horizontal branch then expand to become an AGB star. This page now\nexplores the fate of stars of 8 solar masses or less. These stars are destined\nto eject planetary nebulae and end up as white dwarfs.\n\nPlanetary Nebulae\n\nIn an AGB star, if the helium fuel in the He-burning shell runs low, the outward\nradiation pressure drops off. As this was previously holding out the shell of\nhydrogen gas this shell now contracts, heats up and ignites, converting hydrogen\nto helium. This helium \"ash\" in turn falls onto the helium shell,\nheating it up till it is hot enough to re-ignite in a helium-shell flash, producing\na thermal pulse. Increased radiation pressure now causes the hydrogen shell\nto expand and cool, shutting down H-shell burning.\n\nThe interval between successive thermal pulses decreases as the AGB star ages.\nFor solar-mass stars such pulses dramatically increase the luminosity for several\ndecades. Over time the outer layers of the AGB star are almost totally ejected\nand may initially appear as a circumstellar shell. The ejected cloud contains\ndust grains of silicates and graphite in addition to hydrogen and elements produced\nvia nucleosynthesis reactions within the parent star. The cloud has typical\nexpansion velocities of tens of kilometres per second.Our Sun will shed about\n40% of its mass during this phase. More massive stars lose a greater percentage\nof their initial mass.\n\nWith the ejection of the outer layers of the star, its hot, dense core is left\nexposed. It is initially so hot that the intense ultraviolet radiation it emits\nionises the expanding, ejected shell. This results in the cloud glowing, similar\nto an emission nebula. Such objects are called planetary nebulae after\ntheir initial description by Herschel in the 18th century. Through small telescopes\nthey appear as faint discs, like a dim planet though they are not related. Planetary\nnebulae typically contain 0.1 - 0.2 solar masses at densities equivalent to\na vacuum on Earth. Spectacular images by modern telescopes including the HST\nreveal a wide range of shapes that pose interesting problems for theorists to\nexplain.\n\nA gallery of planetary nebulae taken by the HST.\n\nThe bipolar nature of many planetary nebulae may be due to the parent star\nbeing in a binary system. Strong magnetic fields of remnant cores may also influence\nthe shape of the nebulae. Colour of the nebulae reveals information about their\ncomposition. The characteristic blue-green colour is from the doubly-ionised\noxygen emissions, OIII. Oxygen, carbon and some s-process elements\nejected by AGBs and found in planetary nebulae may eventually seed the ISM for\nthe next generation of star formation. Some of the carbon and oxygen in our\nbodies may have come from such nebulae, the rest probably came from supernovae\nexplosions.\n\nPlanetary nebulae do not exist for long. An expanding shell of dust and gas\nmay only be visible for a few 20,000 years or so before dispersing into the\nISM. There are, however, over 1,500 known in our galaxy and others are visible\nin nearby galaxies. They are useful as one method for determining distances\nto these galaxies.\n\nAlthough a planetary nebula is only short-lived, the exposed core remains.\nWe shall now see what happens to it.\n\nWhite Dwarfs\n\nThe exposed, remnant core that ionised the planetary nebula material is basically\nan extremely hot, dense sphere of carbon and oxygen. Any hydrogen not ejected\nquickly fuses via shell-burning. When initially exposed, the central star, with\na temperature greater than 30,000 K may have a luminosity 100,000 \u00d7 that\nof our Sun but it quickly fades by up to 90% within a century. The stellar remnant\nbecomes a white dwarf or wd with a surface temperature of\nabout 104 K.\n\nWhite dwarfs have unusual properties. Firstly, they are very small but the\nmore massive white dwarfs are actually smaller than less massive ones. With\ntheir fuel used up no fusion takes place so there is no outward radiation pressure\nto withstand gravitational collapse. More massive stellar cores experience stronger\ngravitational force so actually compress more. A 0.5 solar-mass white dwarf\nhas a radius 1.9 \u00d7 that of Earth, a 1.0 solar-mass one is only 1.5 earth\nradii whilst a 1.3 solar-mass white dwarf 1.4 earth radii. A white dwarf is\ncomposed of carbon and oxygen ions mixed in with a sea of degenerate electrons.\nIt is the degeneracy pressure provided by the electrons that prevents further\ncollapse.\n\nA white dwarf, with a mass roughly that of the Sun packed into a volume not\nmuch greater than the Earth must have an extremely high density. At 109\nkg m-3 its density is one million times greater than that of water.\nAlthough its surface temperature is about 10,000 K, the core temperature may\nbe as high as 107 K. The heat trapped within a white dwarf will gradually\nbe radiated away by it but with its small radius, a white dwarf has only a small\nsurface area. Heat therefore cannot escape quickly. In fact it will take tens\nto hundreds of billions of years for a white dwarf to radiate away its heat\nand cool down to a black, inert clump of carbon and degenerate electrons. As\nthe Universe is not yet old enough for this to have happened, all the white\ndwarfs that have ever formed in single-star systems are still white dwarfs.\n\nInterestingly, not only are the more massive dwarfs smaller than less massive\nones, they are also less luminous for the reason explained above. Typical luminosities\nare less than 10-3 that of our Sun. More massive white dwarfs, having\nsmaller surface areas but more trapped heat, take longer to cool down than lower-mass\nones. As white dwarfs are so faint they are also hard to detect. We are only\nable to observe relatively close ones. Nonetheless white dwarfs are thought\nto comprise about 10% of the stars in our galaxy. Nearby examples are Sirius\nB and Procyon B, both of which are found in binary systems.\n\nWhite dwarfs in the globular cluster M4. The white dwarfs\n(circled) are about 12 billion years old, the oldest yet observed and at 30th\nmagnitude, also the faintest. For more details read the press\nrelease.\n\nThe Chandrasekhar Limit\n\nWhat is the upper-mass limit for a white dwarf? We may imagine that\nif we increase the mass of a degenerate core it simply becomes smaller. Whilst\nthis is true there is a limit. If the mass of the stellar remnant exceeds 1.4\nsolar masses then the electron degenerate pressure is insufficient to withstand\nthe force of gravity. The core will thus continue to collapse and form either\na neutron star or a black hole. Both of these are discussed in more detail on\nthe next page. The value of 1.4\nsolar masses is called the Chandrasekhar limit after the Indian astrophysicist,\nSubrahmanyan Chandrasekhar (1910-1995). He won the 1993 Nobel Prize in Physics\nfor this discovery and now has NASA's X-ray observatory, Chandra,\nnamed in his honour. His theoretical calculations have so far held the observational\ntest - no white dwarfs have been found with a mass greater than 1.4 solar masses.\n\nOne point to remember about this Chandrasekhar limit is that it refers to the\nmass of the material in the remnant core after all other mass loss. Stars loose\na lot of their mass as they evolve off the main sequence and become an AGB.\nThe upper mass-limit for a main sequence star that will go on to form a white\ndwarf rather than a neutron star is not precisely known but is thought to be\nabout 8 solar masses. A 2 solar-mass star will probably end up as a 0.7 solar-mass\nwhite dwarf. At present the lower-mass limit for any white dwarf is about 0.6\nsolar masses. These dwarfs form from main sequence stars slightly less than\n1 solar-mass. Main sequence stars much less than this have not yet had time\nto evolve off the main sequence and form white dwarfs as the Universe is not\nyet old enough."}

If the bursts originated within the Milky Way one would\nexpect to see a horizontal clustering of points in the middle of the\ngraph. No such clustering is evident. At present there is no agreed\nupon model for what causes these bursts. In fact scientists even disagree\nover where the bursts are coming from. A few think they may originate\nwithin our solar system, some believe that they are associated with\na large extended halo around the Milky Way, and others believe that\nthey are very distant objects.\n\nThe EGRET\ninstrument (also on the Compton Observatory) has detected photons with\nenergies up to 20 billion volts (GeV) from gamma-ray bursts. Thus there\nis a good chance that gamma-ray bursts emit particles energetic enough\nfor Milagro to detect. If so Milagro may be able to estimate the distance\nto these objects. This can be accomplished by studying the shape of\nthe energy spectrum at energies near 1 trillion volts. If they are distant\nobjects then these photons will be absorbed by interactions with starlight\nas they travel towards the earth. In this case we will not see many\nphotons above 1 trillion volts. However if they are \"close\"\nto earth, that is within our galactic neighborhood, we should see photons\nwith energies above a trillion volts.\n\nSolar Physics\n\nWhile it may appear that our Sun is a relatively quiet star, in fact\nthe surface of the Sun can be violent. As we enter a period of increased\nsolar activity (known as solar maximum), the violence on the Sun's surface\nis increasing. In some cases, huge quantities of plasma are ejected\nthrough the corona at speeds ranging from ~10 to ~2000 km/s. These events\nare known as coronal mass ejections, or CMEs. Due to driven shocks and\nreconfigurations of the solar magnetic field structure, these events\nare often associated with energetic particle acceleration. When the\ncharged particles reach the earth they interact high in our ionosphere\nand can wreak havoc on our power grid, communications, and satellites.\nWhile the exact mechanism is not completely understood, the particles\nthat accompany a CME can be very energetic. To date the highest energy\nparticles observed from the Sun have had energies of several GeV (billion\nelectron-Volts). Follow this link for a\nslideshow of a CME by P. Charbonneau and O.R. White of the High\nAltitude Observatory (NCAR) in Boulder Colorado. This series of pictures\nbelow of a CME is taken from their slide show.\n\nOperating in a different mode than that normally used to detect air\nshowers (Milagro can and does operate in both modes simultaneously)\nMilagro can have significant sensitivity to protons and neutrons with\nenergies as low as 4 GeV. We call this mode of operation \"scaler\nmode\". Here we simply count how many times all of the PMTs in the\npond are struck by light each second. Thus, even if only a single particle\nfrom an air shower reaches the pond it can be detected. This is how\nwe gain sensitivity at such low energies. The drawback of this technique\nis that we can not reconstruct the direction from which the particle\narrived. So our \"background\" (the constant data rate over\nwhich signal must be observed) rate is quite high, being integrated\nover the entire overhead sky. Nonetheless, Milagro is the world's most\nsensitive detector of multi-GeV particles from the Sun."}
{"text": "You Are Here\n\nPhysics Department\n\nKeeble Observatory\n\nDecember 2002 Sky from the Keeble Observatory\n\nBlack holes seem like the exotic stuff of science fiction, yet\ntoday we acknowledge them as only too real. Einstein's General Theory\nof Relativity tells us that every object with mass warps space and\ntime in its vicinity. We aren't usually aware of this, because the\ndistortion is very small except for very massive objects, like stars\nor galaxies. In 1919 it was confirmed that starlight passing near\nthe surface of the Sun is deflected a tiny amount - exactly as predicted\nby Dr. Einstein's theory. (When first told of this confirmation,\nhe was asked how he would have felt if the observations had not\nsupported his calculations. His reply, typically wry, was that It\nwould have been a pity, because the theory is correct.)\n\nThe strength of the gravitational field (i.e. the amount of curvature\nof space-time it causes) is proportional to the mass of the object,\nand inversely proportional to the square of the distance from its\ncenter. At any distance from a star or planet (or a person, for\nthat matter) we can calculate the escape speed necessary for a\nprojectile to recede forever. The more massive the object, the greater\nspeed required. (Escape from Earth's surface requires a speed of\nabout 7 miles per second. Escape from the Sun's surface takes about\n125 miles per second. Compress the Sun into an Earth-sized ball,\nand the escape speed will be 300 times greater (same mass, smaller\nradius). Compress it to a ball a few kilometers in radius, the escape\nspeed is greater still. Keep compressing, and eventually that escape\nspeed is the speed of light . the object is now a black hole!\n\nWhere do we find them? Massive black holes, in excess of a million\nsolar masses, are found at the cores of many galaxies - including\nour own Milky Way, whose core regions are about 25,000 light years\naway in the constellation Sagittarius. They are detected by observing\norbital motions of stars near the core, and by the x-ray emissions\nfrom gas heated as it falls into the black hole. (And, no, they\nare not cosmic vacuum cleaners sucking in their surroundings. Outside\nthe event horizon they are just massive gravitational centers,\nand it's possible to orbit or escape. It's from the event horizon\ninward that they represent an inescapable potential well.)\n\nAnd, now, one has been detected of far smaller mass and much closer\nto Earth. The object, with the catalog designation GRO J1655-40,\nis some 6000 - 9000 light years away, heading in our general direction\nat about 250,000 miles per hour. (Don't sell your real estate just\nyet - it will take about 15 million years to get here!) It is detected\nbecause it has a close companion star, which orbits it every 2\ufffd\ndays. Gas escaping the atmosphere of this companion is falling into\nthe black hole, emitting copious x-rays in the process. Some of\nthat gas is being ejected from the system in extremely energetic\njets of debris, streaming away at nearly the speed of light.\n\nThis find is exciting, because it seems to confirm the theoretical\nnotion that one way to make a black hole is from a supernova explosion\n- essentially compressing the core of the exploding star at the\nsame time the envelope is blasted into space. This particular black\nhole probably formed in the inner part of the Galaxy's disk, where\nstar formation proceeds at a faster rate than in our vicinity. Other\nthan a supernova, it is difficult to imagine any real phenomenon\nwhich could propel a stellar mass object to such speed. Thus, it\nprovides a link between our theories of stellar evolution and our\nideas about black holes.\n\nLunar phases for December: New Moon at 2:34 am on the 4th; First\nQuarter at 10:49 am on the 11th; Full Moon on the 19th at 2:10 pm;\nLast quarter on the 26th at 7:31 pm.\n\nSaturn will be at opposition on the 17th, so this is a good month\nto look for the ringed planet virtually all night long.

{"text": "Milky Way Versus Andromeda As Seen from Earth\n\nFrom HubbleCast. Scientists have been using Hubble observations to predict the future of the Andromeda Galaxy and the Milky Way, and how the collision will look from Earth. Projecting the motion of Andromeda's stars over the next 8 billion years, the astronomers now know the path that galaxy is taking through space. And it's heading straight for us! Computer simulations based on Hubble observations show how the two galaxies will crash together in around 4 billion years' time.\n\nThe Andromeda Galaxy, some 2.2 million light-years away, is the closest spiral galaxy to our home, the Milky Way. For around a century, astronomers have known it is moving towards us, but whether or not the two galaxies would actually collide, or simply fly past each other, remained unclear. Now, a team of astronomers has used the Hubble Space Telescope to shed light on this question, by looking at the motion stars in the Andromeda Galaxy.\n\nWe wanted to figure out how Andromeda was moving through space. So in order to do that we measured the location of the Andromeda stars relative to the background galaxies. In 2002 they were in one place, and in 2010 they were in a slightly different place. And that allowed us to measure the motion over a period of eight years.\n\nThe motion is actually incredibly subtle, and not obvious to the human eye, even when looking at Hubble's sharp images. However, sophisticated image analysis revealed tiny movements that the scientists were able to project into the future.\n\nBased on these findings, it is finally possible to show what will happen to the Milky Way over the next eight billion years, as the galaxies drift closer, then collide and gradually merge into a single, larger, elliptical galaxy with reddish stars. And yet the Solar System should in fact survive this huge crash.\n\nThe reason we think that our Solar System will not be much affected by this collision between the Milky Way and Andromeda is that galaxies are mostly empty space.\nEven though our galaxy,"}

{"text": "This article needs attention from an expert on the subject. Please add a reason or a talk parameter to this template to explain the issue with the article. Consider associating this request with a WikiProject.(August 2010)\n\nAstronomical spectroscopy is the technique of spectroscopy used in astronomy. The object of study is the spectrum of electromagnetic radiation, including visible light, which radiates from stars and other hot celestial objects. Spectroscopy can be used to derive many properties of distant stars and galaxies, such as their chemical composition, temperature, density, mass, distance, luminosity, and relative motion using Doppler shift measurements.\n\nContents\n\nAstronomical spectroscopy began with Isaac Newton's initial observations of the light of the Sun, dispersed by a prism. He saw a rainbow of colour, and may even have seen absorption lines.[citation needed] These dark bands which appear throughout the solar spectrum were first described in detail by Joseph von Fraunhofer. Most stellar spectra share these dominant features of the Sun's spectrum: emission at all wavelengths across the electromagnetic spectrum (a continuum) with many discrete absorption lines at certain wavelengths, resulting from a deficiency of observed photons at those particular wavelengths.\n\nFraunhofer's original (1817) designations of absorption lines in the solar spectrum\n\nThe absorption lines in stellar spectra can be used to determine the chemical composition of the star. Each element is responsible for a different set of absorption lines in the spectrum, at wavelengths which can be measured extremely accurately by laboratory experiments. Then, an absorption line at the given wavelength in a stellar spectrum shows that the element must be present. Of particular importance are the absorption lines of hydrogen (which is found in the atmosphere of nearly every star); the hydrogen lines within the visual spectrum are known as Balmer lines.\n\nIn 1868, Sir Norman Lockyer observed strong yellow lines in the solar spectrum which had never been seen in laboratory experiments. He deduced that they must be due to an unknown element, which he called helium, from the Greek helios (sun). Helium wasn't conclusively detected on earth until 25 years later.\n\nAlso in the 1860s, emission lines (particularly a green line) were observed in the coronal spectrum during solar eclipses that did not correspond to any known spectral lines. Again it was proposed that these were due to an unknown element, provisionally named coronium. It was not until the 1930s that it was discovered that these lines were due to highly ionised iron and nickel, the high ionisation being due to the extreme temperature of the solar corona.\n\nIn conjunction with atomic physics and models of stellar evolution, stellar spectroscopy is today used to determine a multitude of properties of stars: their distance, age, luminosity and rate of mass loss can all be estimated from spectral studies. Doppler shift studies of the spectral lines can uncover the presence of hidden companions such as black holes and exoplanets.\n\nIn the early days of telescopic astronomy, the word nebula was used to describe any fuzzy patch of light that didn't look like a star. Many of these, such as the Andromeda Nebula, had spectra that looked in many ways a lot like stellar spectra, and these turned out to be galaxies. Others, such as the Cat's Eye Nebula, had very different spectra. When William Huggins looked at the Cat's Eye, he found no continuous spectrum like that seen in the Sun, but just a few strong emission lines. These lines did not correspond to any known elements on earth, and so just as helium had been identified in the Sun, astronomers suggested that the lines were due to a new element, nebulium (occasionally nebulum or nephelium). The hypothetical nebulium that was invoked to account for certain bright lines in gaseous nebulae were shown by Ira Sprague Bowen in 1927 as due to doubly ionizedoxygen at extremely low density. As Henry Norris Russell put it, \"Nebulium has vanished into thin air.\" But nebulae are typically extremely rarefied, much less dense than the hardest vacuum ever produced on earth. In these conditions, atoms behave quite differently and lines can form which are suppressed at normal densities. These lines are known as forbidden lines, and are the strongest lines in most nebular spectra.[1]\n\nThe spectra of galaxies look somewhat similar to stellar spectra, as they consist of the light from millions of stars combined. Galactic spectroscopy has led to many fundamental discoveries. Edwin Hubble discovered in the 1920s that, apart from the nearest ones (those in what is known as the Local Group), all galaxies are receding from the Earth. The further away a galaxy, the faster it is receding (see Hubble's Law). This was the first indication that the universe originated from a single point, in a Big Bang.\n\nDoppler shift studies of clusters of galaxies by Fritz Zwicky found that most galaxies were moving much faster than seemed to be possible, from what was known about the mass of the cluster. Zwicky hypothesised that there must be a great deal of non-luminous matter in the galaxy clusters, which became known as dark matter.\n\nIn the 1950s, some strong radio sources were found to be associated with very dim objects that seemed to be very red. These were named Quasi-stellar radio sources, or quasars. When the first spectrum of one of these objects was taken, it was something of a mystery, with absorption lines at wavelengths where none were expected. It was soon realised that what was observed was a normal galactic spectrum, but highly redshifted. According to Hubble's Law, this implied that the quasar must be extremely distant in space and time, and therefore highly luminous. Quasars are now thought to be galaxies forming in the early years of our universe, with their extreme energy output powered by super-massive black holes.\n\nPlanets and asteroids shine only by the reflected light of their parent star. The reflected light contains absorption bands due to minerals in the rocks present for rocky bodies, or due to the elements and molecules present in the atmospheres of the Gas giants. Asteroids can be classified into three main types, according to their spectra: the C-types are made of carbonaceous material, S-types consist mainly of silicates, and M-types are 'metallic'. C- and S-type asteroids are the most common.\n\nThe spectra of comets consist of a reflected solar spectrum from the dusty clouds surrounding the comet, as well as emission lines from gaseous atoms and molecules excited to fluorescence by sunlight and/or chemical reactions. Nearby comets can even be seen in X-ray as solar wind ions flying to the coma are neutralized. The cometary X-ray spectra therefore reflect the state of the solar wind rather than that of the comet. Many organic chemicals are known to exist in comets, and it has been suggested that cometary impacts provided the Earth with much of the water for its oceans and the chemicals necessary for the formation of life. It has even been suggested that life may have been brought to earth from interstellar space by comets (the Panspermia theory).\n\nStars emit light at all frequencies in the core; molecules, atoms, and ions that may be present near the surface of the star will absorb strongly at certain characteristic frequencies. Thus the observed spectrum will contain relatively dark bands at the characteristic frequencies of constituents of the outer layers. Absorption spectra of nebulae and planetary atmospheres arise simply when molecules absorb light of from the parent star and re-emit it in random directions and at different frequencies.[2][3]\n\nIt is not hard to view spectra of astronomical objects. A simple, homemade DVD spectrograph can be used to view solar spectra.[4] Note that looking at the Sun directly or by reflection can result in temporary or permanent loss of vision. Proper equipment must be used, and children should be supervised.\n\nRecently, there has been a resurgence in amateur astronomical spectroscopy.[5] It is possible to use a digital camera or telescope to easily view spectra of astronomical objects.[6]\n\nInexpensive diffraction gratings like the Paton Hawksley Star Analyser[7] or the Rainbow Optics Star Spectroscope[8] can be used to split the starlight. Software like RSpec[9] can be used to plot the curves.\n\nAn excellent introduction to amateur spectroscopy is Astronomical Spectroscopy for Amateurs, published in 2011.[10]\n\nAlso, Sky & Telescope Magazine has produced an excellent video interview that explains how to get started.[11]"}

The first stars are so distant and formed so long ago that they are invisible to our best telescopes.\n\nIf a planet or moon has only a slight rotational tilt, a tall mountain or crater rim can be forever bathed in sunlight.

{"text": "Sagitarius is probably the most dense cloud in our\nmilkyway. Lots of molecules are found in this cloud. (Royal Observatory Edinburgh)\n\nInterstellar matter distinguishes its presence\nin obvious ways. We can observe them as shining nebula, like the Orion nebula,\nthat mainly consist of hydrogen atoms that are ionized by the radiation\nof young, hot stars.\nAlso they are visible as dark, black spots in the sky, dark silhouettes\na midst the stars.\n\nAtom and molecular clouds. Interstellar matter consists mainly of hydrogen\n(90%) and helium (approx. 10%). Only one out of one thousand particles\nin the clouds contain other elements, like carbon, nitrogen and oxygen.\nThe dust particles, that form only a small part of the cloud, consist mainly\nof silicates (sand like matter) and graphite which are often surrounded by\na small layer of ice.\n\nThe dark interstellar clouds are the most dense and are cold concentrations\nof interstellar gas. They are this dark because they contain dust particles\nthat extinguish the light of the stars that they lay behind. In these dark clouds\nmost molecules are found, besides the dust. Because of the presence\nof molecules these clouds are called molecular clouds, to distinguish\nthem from ordinary atom clouds.\nOften the dark clouds are\njoined with luminous nebula, since from molecular clouds new\nstars are formed. These young stars emit lots of ultraviolet\nradiation that light up the surrounding gas.\nThe new stars that are formed from molecular clouds are called second\ngeneration stars. Because of the molecules and more complex atoms,\noften astroids and planets come into being around these stars.\nOur Sun is an example of a second generation star with a planetary system orbiting it.\n\nGiant Molecular Clouds. Giant Molecular Clouds, that contain more than one million sun masses\nof matter, are the heaviest objects in our Milkyway.\nThe total mass of molecular clouds is comparable with the mass of the atom\nclouds that are observable through the\n21-cm radiation of the hydrogen atom.\nTogether they hold between five to ten percent of the mass of the stars\nin the Milkyway. Although astronomers\nspeak about 'dense' clouds, these areas are very thin, the average density\nin interstellar clouds is much lower than that of the best vacuum we can\ncreate on Earth. Besides the temperature of these clouds is enormously\nlow, only a few degrees above the absolute zero point. Chemical activity\nseems impossible under these conditions, still we find a rich variety of\nchemical compounds.\n\nObservation of molecules. In\nthe so called diffusion clouds we can see the atoms and molecules\nthrough the absorbtion lines\nat visible and ultraviolet\nwavelengths in the spectrum\nof a star in the background.\nThese absorbtion lines are very slim because of the very low temperature\nof the cloud. In this way it is possible to determine exactly at which\nwavelengths molecules in the cloud absorb the starlight.\nBetween 1937 and 1941 by means of this technique the first interstellar\nmolecules CN, CH and CH+ were detected.\nWith dark clouds this way of detection is not applicable, since\nvisible light cannot penetrate them.\nHere the molecules are determined via molecular emmision lines.\nThrough collision with other particles molecules reach a higher energy level.\nWhen it eventually falls back again to a lower level it emits a photon\n(light particle).This photon is detectable with a radio or microwave telescope.\n\nThe most frequent molecule H2 however is very\nhard to determine, the emission lines are too weak to detect.\nThe second most fequent molecule after H2 is carbon-monoxide,\nCO, which emits very strong radiation. The ratio in the quantities of\nthese molecules in interstellar matter is rather constant so detecting\nthe quantity of CO in a cloud gives a good indication of the quantity of\nH2.\nNowadays about 80 different molecules are found in the universe, amongst\nwhich also rather large ones like ethanol (CH3CH2OH).\n\nThe chemical cycle. The interstellar material forms a dynamic reservoir from which stars\nare formed and to which they return their remnants. The cycle starts\nwith the most diffused atom clouds, the interstellar cirrus.\nThese are mainly composed of atoms and contain only very few molecules.\nIn the next phase the atom cloud develops into diffusedmolecular\nclouds, where simple molecules like H2, CO, CH, CH+,\nC2, CN and OH frequently occur. These clouds evolve\nto more dense clouds, then the most dense parts are contracting, which\neventually leads to a new star formation.\n\nHere two different possibilities can be distinguished: the formation\nof stars with low density (comparable with that of the Sun) and\nthe formation of stars with a much larger mass.\n\nWhen low mass stars are\nformed the temperature remains rather low. In clouds of very low temperatures\nand large density the molecules condense at the surface of the dust particles.\nThese finally turn up at the planets and comets that are formed\nin the nebula near the newly born star.\nAfter its long lifetime the star\nultimately becomes a red giant, at which stage they loose a part of their\nmass. They shed mass in due of peels that expand in space. From these peels\nnew dust particles are formed, in which large molecular elements are present.\n\nThe lifecycle of clouds that form larger\nstars is much faster. In these clouds the temperatures are higher\n(50 to 200 kelvin). When the clouds are near a young heavy star the chemical\nreactions take place under influence of ultraviolet light and shockwaves,\nhere new molecular combinations are formed. After a short while the\nheavy stars develop into supernovas where the\nmatter is expelled and blasted into space.\nNow the chemical cycle is finished, the freshly formed elements and dust particles\nreassemble to diffused clouds and the process restarts."}
{"text": "There are many similarities between this process and that which results in recurrent novae. For an X-ray burst, the compact object is a neutron star which accretes a surface layer of helium that undergoes explosive burning to produce the outburst. For recurrent novae, the compact object is a white dwarf which accretes a surface layer of hydrogen that undergoes explosive burning to produce the outburst.\n\nX-ray bursts generally occur at regular intervals separated by several hours or days. They have durations ranging from a few seconds to a few minutes, with the burst profile showing a rapid rise (0.3 - 10 seconds) followed by a slower decline (5 - 100 seconds). The rapid rise reflects the sudden increase in temperature brought about by explosive helium ignition, while the slower decline arises due to the slower cooling of the surface of the star.\n\nAll of the above refers to Type I X-ray bursts which make up the vast majority of this class of object. In fact, there are only two Type II X-ray bursts known, one of which also shows Type I outbursts. A Type II burst is thought to be due to an increase in the rate of accretion from the companion star and is distinguished from a Type I burst through its burst profile. While Type I bursts have a rapid rise followed by a slow decline, Type II bursts start and stop abruptly with no gradual decay from peak. They can also show rapid successions of bursts separated by a few minutes."}
{"text": "\"Eta Carinae Nebula\" redirects here. It is not to be confused with Eta Carinae's Homunculus Nebula.\n\nThe Carina Nebula (also known as the Great Nebula in Carina, the Eta Carina Nebula, NGC 3372, or Caldwell 92, as well as the Grand Nebula) is a large bright nebula that has within its boundaries several related open clusters of stars. Some papers generally refer to this as the Carina Nebula, mostly because of differentiating the many paper published on this object, but the historical precedence as determined by southern observers like James Dunlop and John Herschel, who have both termed it the Eta Argus Nebula or Eta Carina Nebula.[4]..\"[dubious\u2013 discuss] John Herschel also describes \"The star \u03b7 Argus, with the Great nebula about it.\" [5], with many of his subsequent published papers supporting this. [6][7]\n\nThe nebula is one of the largest diffuse nebulae in our skies. Although it is some four times as large and even brighter than the famous Orion Nebula, the Carina Nebula is much less well known, due to its location in the southern sky. It was discovered by Nicolas Louis de Lacaille in 1751\u201352 from the Cape of Good Hope.\n\nEta Carinae is a highly luminoushypergiantstar. Estimates of its mass range from 100 to 150 times the mass of the Sun, and its luminosity is about four million times that of the Sun.\n\nThis object is currently the most massive star that can be studied in great detail, because of its location and size still had the highest confirmed luminosity, based on data across a broad range of wavelengths.) Stars with more than 80 times the mass of the Sun produce more than a million times as much light as the Sun. They are quite rare\u2014only a few dozen in a galaxy as big as ours\u2014and they flirt with disaster near the Eddington limit, i.e., the outward pressure of their radiation is almost strong enough to counteract gravity. Stars that are more than 120 solar masses exceed the theoretical Edd the above image and some other less visible objects have tails pointing directly away from the massive star. The entire nebula would have looked very different before the Great Eruption in the 1840s surrounded Eta Carinae with dust, drastically reducing the amount of ultraviolet light it put into the nebula.\n\nWithin the large bright nebula is a much smaller feature, immediately surrounding Eta Carinae itself. This small nebula is known as the Homunculus Nebula (from the Latin meaning Little Man), and is believed to have been ejected in an enormous outburst in 1841 which briefly made Eta Carinae the second-brightest star in the sky bright filaments of hot, fluorescing gas, silhouetted against the much brighter background nebula. The diameter of the Keyhole structure is approximately 7 light years. NGC 3324 is a designation for the Keyhole Nebula.[9]\n\nThe \"Mystic Mountain\" is an image of a dust\u2013gas pillar in the Carina Nebula taken by Hubble Space Telescope on its 20th anniversary.

They're a whopping 12 billion light years away, which puts their formative period around two billion years after the Big Bang, which means all this happened a full billion years before astronomers thought it did.

After over 13 years of not knowing, the Grossmans finally had an answer, though still not a permanent solution.\n\nThe researchers found three mutations in two of Lilly's genes, one that would cause the tremors and another that would cause muscle weakness and a lack of balance, which are the likely causes for her condition. Ceasing a laundry list of medications, Lilly was soon switched to a small variety of supplements and the drug Diamox, which helped another family with a similar gene mutation.

They will instead orbit the black\nhole just as the planets orbit the Sun in our solar system. The\ngravitational force on stars and planets orbiting a black hole is the\nsame as when the black hole was a normal star.\n\nSupermassive black holes have masses comparable to those of a typical\ngalaxy. These masses range anywhere from 10 billion to 100 billion of\nour Suns. Supermassive black holes tend to be in the centers of\ngalaxies, creating what are called Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs). An AGN\nemits more energy than would be expected from a typical galactic\nnucleus. The answer as to why this is so lies in the presence of the\nsupermassive black hole in the galactic center. In some AGN, the massive\nblack hole and its accretion disk somehow produce outward-moving streams\nof particles that are projected away perpendicular to the disk. These\nstreams are known as jets and have the power to accelerate electrons\nalmost to the speed of light. This produces gamma-rays that can be\ndetected by gamma-ray observatories. The most powerful AGNs in our\nUniverse are called quasars. We have been able to detect quasars that\nreside 15 billion light-years away. Scientists believe that the study of\nquasars will provide information about the Universe during the time of\nearly galaxy formation"}

{"text": "My love affair with spiral galaxies is well documented here on this blog. Of course, I'm biased: I live in one.\n\nBut some of them demand a little more attention than others, like the oddly off-kilter NGC 2442, aka the Meat Hook Galaxy:\n\nThat gorgeous image (click to galactinate, or grab the ginormous 6756 x 5687 pixel version) is from the MPG/ESO 2.2 meter telescope in Chile, and it definitely shows why NGC 2442 is a weird one. The one arm at the bottom is long and stretched out, the top one is thicker and dotted with pink star-forming regions, and the nucleus is way off-center. What the heck happened to this galaxy?\n\n[Note: this image is rotated 180\u00b0 from the one above.] Again, we see lots of red gas clouds glowing, fired up by massive stars forming in them. Interestingly, to me this view of the galaxy looks like a single bird feather, with the individual vanes arcing down. Those vanes are actually streamers of gas and dust pulled out like taffy from the main arm. Given all this, it's pretty clear that NGC 2442 suffered a very close pass or even a collision with another galaxy sometime in the relatively recent past.\n\nBut what galaxy? In the first image above you can see a small spiral galaxy off to the right. But in a much wider-scale image (reversed left to right of the one here) there is another galaxy above NGC 2442. It may have been either of these two\u2026 but I have my suspicions it's the one on the right. In the first picture above, see how the small galaxy has no red star-birth regions in it? Many times, when smaller galaxies ram through big ones, all their gas and dust is stripped out by the bigger galaxy. The lack of gas in the small spiral is something of a tell.\n\nIn the Hubble image you can actually see smaller galaxies right through NGC 2442, too! That always gets me. So cool. But those are almost certainly much more distant background galaxies \u2014 NGC 2442 is roughly 50 million light years away, and those are more like hundreds of millions of light years distant. Even if they are near NGC 2442, they're too small to have caused such a major disruption of the far larger galaxy anyway.\n\nI'll note that a radio survey of this region also detected a huge cloud of neutral hydrogen near NGC 2442 with about a billion times the mass of the Sun! That fits; it was probably free-floating hydrogen in the galaxy that got drawn or blown out by the passage of the smaller galaxy.\n\nPristine, symmetric spirals are so beautiful, but they are also lovely to behold when disrupted by a catastrophic collision, too. The energies and scales involved are mind-numbing, yet from a distance, and apparently frozen in time, they still possess a majesty and grand beauty.\n\nComments (17)\n\nLinks to this Post\n\nSo beautiful\u2026what gets me is how that edge on spiral in the distance is visible through the thicker core regions as if it's just a dirty window. I know it appears yellow because of the higher populations of red giants, older stars and the like toward the core (as it is with most galaxies of this type), but even here the stars must still be very spaced out (lol bad pun ) from each other.\nQuestion: in images like this, I've always suspected that the objects that appear to be individual stars in these galaxies at these distances are not actually individual stars, but clusters. Would this suspicion be true at all?\n\nA 180 degree rotation doesn't make sense\u2026 the long axis of the galaxy would still be at a mismatched viewing orientation compared to the first image. If I'm seeing this right, I'd say the Hubble image is rotated ~90 degrees clockwise from the first.\n\nAs usual, awesome images and awesome posts. I've always been curious though; are the images from Hubble and some of the larger telescopes like the Chilean one that gave us the first image color corrected or manipulated in any way to give us these beautiful images or is this a faithful image of what the universe and our galactic neighbors look like to the naked eye, but extremely magnified? Thanks!\n\nIf you ignore the foreground stars of the Milky Way and the background galaxies in the first picture, the view we are seeing in the first picture may be somewhat equivalent to our view of the Andromeda Galaxy. You can see the Andromeda Galaxy yourself IF you have clear, dark skies away from city lights and are in the northern hemisphere, but it more-or-less appears as a fuzzy star (which is basically the core). If you cheat a bit and use binoculars or even a largish (up to 10-inch in diameter) telescope, most of what you can see with your eyes will be a greenish-white haze surrounding the whiter core. Much of the details that you can get via astrophotography is more due to long exposure rather than magnification. These pictures from ESO and Hubble are further enhanced by the use of light filters to help bring out details of scientific interest such as the star-forming regions.\n\nStill purdy.\n\nAnd I agree with Tom (#4): you have to rotate the ESO picture roughly 90 degree clockwise rotation to get the Hubble view.\n\n@Arthur: Thanks! So\u2026if we could get up close enough to it, the colors would be true right? Nothing has been color enhanced artificially to turn a bunch of white stuff or stuff outside the visible spectrum visible or colorful for us?\n\nBecause it's a little guy it didn't perturb NGC 2442 as much as a lower mass-ratio interaction would have and NGC 2442 consequently doesn't show as significant a kinematic disturbance or increase in star formation.\n\nWhat would this be? I see nothing like that in any of the other galaxies in the image and it doesn't look like an artifact of processing. If this was the galaxy that interacted with NGC 2442, is this some sort of emission resulting from that?\n\n@15 That is almost certainly an image artifact (or satellite?), it is incredibly linear and extends the length of the field. Compare DSS images and the lovely color image in the article and you do not see the same structure."}
{"text": "SN 1993J\n\nSN 1993J is a supernova observed in the galaxy M81. It was discovered on 28 March 1993 by F. Garcia in Spain[1]. At the time, it was the second brightest supernova observed in the twentieth century behind SN 1987A[2].\n\nThe spectral characteristics of the supernova changed over time. Initially, it looked more like a type II supernova (a supernova formed by the explosion of a giant star) with strong hydrogen spectral line emission, but later the hydrogen lines faded and strong helium spectral lines appeared, making the supernova look more like a type Ib[2][3]. Moreover, the variations in SN 1993J's luminosity over time were not like the variations observed in other type II supernovae[4][5] but did resemble the variations observed in type Ib supernovae[6]. Hence, the supernova has been classified as a type IIb, a intermediate class between type II and type Ib[3]. The scientific results from this supernova suggested that type Ib and Ic supernovae were actually formed through the explosions of giant stars through processes similar to what takes place in type II supernovae[3][7]. The supernova was also used to estimate a distance of 8.5 \u00b1 1.3 Mly (2.6 \u00b1 0.4 Mpc) to Messier 81[2].\n\nLight echoes from the explosion have subsequently been detected. [8]\n\nThe progenitor of SN 1993J was identified in pre-explosion ground based images[9]. The progenitor was observed to be a K-supergiant star, with an excess in the ultraviolet possibly due to surrounding hot stars or a hot binary companion. While the supernova is located in a region populated by young massive stars [10], late-time photometry with the Hubble Space Telescope and spectroscopy with the Keck 10m-telescope presented by Maund and collaborators revealed the presence of the long suspected B-supergiant companion star[11].\nReferences"}
{"text": "First 'bone' of the Milky Way identified\n\nJan 08, 2013\n\nResearchers have identified the first \"bone\" of the Milky Way - a long tendril of dust and gas that appears dark in this infrared image from the Spitzer Space Telescope. Running horizontally along this image, the \"bone\" is more than 300 light-years long but only 1 or 2 light-years wide. It contains about 100,000 suns' worth of material. Credit: NASA/JPL/SSC the inside, its exact structure is difficult to determine.\n\nAstronomers have identified a new structure in the Milky Way: a long tendril of dust and gas that they are calling a \"bone.\"\n\n\"This is the first time we've seen such a delicate piece of the galactic skeleton,\" says lead author Alyssa Goodman of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics (CfA). Goodman presented the discovery today in a press conference at a meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Long Beach, Calif.\n\nOtherGoodman and her colleagues spotted the galactic bone while studying a dust cloud nicknamed \"Nessie.\" The central part of the \"Nessie\" bone was discovered in Spitzer Space Telescope data in 2010 by James Jackson (Boston University), who named it after the Loch Ness Monster. Goodman's team noticed that Nessie appears at least twice, and possibly as much as eight times, longer than Jackson's original claim.\n\nRadio emissions from molecular gas show that the feature is not a chance projection of material on the sky, but instead a real feature. Not only is \"Nessie\" in the galactic plane, but also it extends much longer than anyone anticipated. This slender bone of the Milky Way is more than 300 light-years long but only 1 or 2 light-years wide. It contains about 100,000 suns' worth of material, and now looks more like a cosmic snake.\n\n\"This bone is much more like a fibula - the long skinny bone in your leg - than it is like the tibia, or big thick leg bone,\" explains Goodman.\n\n\"It's possible that the 'Nessie' bone lies within a spiral arm, or that it is part of a web connecting bolder spiral features. Our hope is that we and other astronomers will find more of these features, and use them to map the skeleton of the Milky Way in 3-D,\" she adds.Actually I am not 'up' on this moder astro terminology. Is it called a 'bone' because it has an epiphysis/metaphysis structure at the end points? Oh I get it! Is it close to Canis Major and Sirius? All sound a bit 'Humerus' to me.\n\nComputer simulations of galaxy formation show webs of filaments within spiral disks. It is very likely that the newly discovered Milky Way feature is one of these \"bone-like\" filaments.\n\nUnfortunately, the simulations are based on a theorectical model with very little basis in reality. No one has any experience of the formation of any galaxy since no one was around to record how any galaxy came into existence. Therefore, the model used here is based on pure speculation of how galaxies MIGHT have formed. One tiny little problem, for instance, would be how to account for the existence of galactic magnetic fields.\n\nHow did that arise, given the inability of the currently accepted model to account for just that small, insignificant thorn in the flesh?\n\nNever mind the other small thorn of how the first star came into being in the first place, all by itself"}

The outer parts of this vast nebula have now been imaged by VLT, producing the best picture of this region taken so far.\n\nAccording to the ESO, the new picture shows a broad river of dust across the centre that absorbs the light from more distant objects. To the right there is a small cluster of brilliant blue-white young stars that have formed from the gas. These are probably only a few million years old, very young by stellar standards. The intense ultraviolet radiation streaming out from these stars is hollowing out a cavity in the surrounding gas and dust and sculpting it in strange ways.\n\nThe image is covered with dark trails of cosmic dust, but some of the most fascinating dark features appear at the lower right and on the right hand edge of the picture. Here the radiation from the bright young stars has created curious elephant trunk columns. Cosmic dust is much finer than the more familiar domestic variety. It more closely resembles smoke and consists mostly of tiny particles of silicates, graphite, and water ice that were produced and expelled into space by earlier generations of stars.\n\nThe bright central part of NGC 6357 contains a cluster of high-mass stars whose inhabitants are among the brightest in our galaxy. This inner region, not seen in this new picture, has been much studied and imaged by the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope.

The black hole is orbited by a thick disk of hot gas. The center of the disk glows white-hot, while the edge of the disk is shown in dark silhouette. Magnetic fields channel some material into a jetlike outflow \u2014 the greenish wisps that extend to upper right and lower left. A dotted line marks the innermost stable circular orbit, which is the closest distance that material can orbit before becoming unstable and plunging into the black hole.\n\nUsing a continent-spanning telescope, an international team of astronomers has peered to the edge of a black hole at the center of a distant galaxy. For the first time, they have measured the black hole's \"point of no return\" \u2014 the closest distance that matter can approach before being irretrievably pulled into the black hole.\n\nA black hole is a region in space where the pull of gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape. Its boundary is known as the event horizon.\n\nThe team examined the black hole at the center of a giant elliptical galaxy called Messier 87 (M87), which is located about 50 million light-years from Earth. The black hole is 6 billion times more massive than the sun. It's surrounded by an accretion disk of gas swirling toward the black hole's maw. Although the black hole is invisible, the accretion disk is hot enough to glow.\n\n\"Even though this black hole is far away, it's so big that its apparent size on the sky is about the same as the black hole at the center of the Milky Way,\" says co-author Jonathan Weintroub of the CfA. \"That makes it an ideal target for study.\"\n\nAccording to Einstein's theory of general relativity, a black hole's mass and spin determine how close material can orbit before becoming unstable and falling in toward the event horizon. The team was able to measure this innermost stable orbit and found that it's only 5.5 times the size of the black hole's event horizon. This size suggests that the accretion disk is spinning in the same direction as the black hole.\n\nThe observations were made by linking together radio telescopes in Hawaii, Arizona, and California to create a virtual telescope called the Event Horizon Telescope, or EHT. The EHT is capable of seeing details 2,000 times finer than the Hubble Space Telescope.\n\nThe team plans to expand its telescope array, adding radio dishes in Chile, Europe, Mexico, Greenland, and the South Pole, in order to obtain even more detailed pictures of black holes in the futureAt first glance, the center of the Milky Way seems like a very inhospitable place to try to form a planet. New research by astronomers at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics shows that planets still can form in this cosmic maelstrom.\n\nHarvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics' astronomers have detected for the first time jets of gamma rays extending thousands of light years from the Milky Way's core, confirming expectations based on observations of other galaxies."}

{"text": "Our Connection to the Cosmos\n\nOur story begins in a vast cloud of protons, about 14 billion years ago. The cloud consisted almost entirely of hydrogen atoms, with one proton each, and a trace amount of helium, with two protons in each atom. With the mass of 100 suns, the cloud spread over a sphere in space about a light year in diameter. It had separated from an even larger cloud with the mass of 1000s of suns, and now began to shrink, drawn to its center by its own gravitational attraction. In this original cloud of protons, let us follow the progress of 26 of them.\n\nThe protons in the cloud moved extremely slowly at first, with a temperature only a few degrees above absolute zero. As the cloud gradually shrank, the protons falling toward the center of the cloud and traveling steadily faster, the temperature rose, and collisions between protons became more frequent. After millions of years had passed, the vast cloud had shrunk to a diameter a few times larger than our sun, the protons had fallen an immense distance and were now traveling at speeds of thousands of miles per second, and the temperature in the core of the cloud approached 12 million degrees.\n\nAt such high collision speeds, the single protons of hydrogen atoms fuse (after a rather complicated process) into helium atoms of two protons each, releasing enormous amounts of energy. With thermonuclear fusion now occurring in the core of the cloud, the shrinking of the cloud had stopped, and a stable star had formed.\n\nFor the next 100 million years this colossal star continued to convert hydrogen to helium, and along the way our 26 protons fused into 13 helium atoms. This star did not have rocky planets in its solar system \u2013 at this time in the history of the universe, only hydrogen and helium existed, and no rocks could form.\n\nGradually, the supply of hydrogen in the core was converted to helium, and the star began to run low on fresh hydrogen fuel. The rate of reaction fell, the star began to lose temperature and pressure, and the ever-present gravity forced the center of the star to shrink dramatically. Again gas fell toward the center of the star, causing the speed of the atoms to soar, raising the temperature to higher extremes, approaching 100 million degrees.\n\nThe combination of drawing in fresh hydrogen from the lower atmosphere of the star, and the beginning of helium fusion \u2013 three helium atoms combining to form one carbon atom with 6 protons \u2013 created a new source of energy to stop the further collapse of the star. This surge of energy caused the enormous atmosphere of the star to expand to fill a vast volume of space \u2013 about the diameter of the orbit of Mars in our solar system. The star became a red supergiant. Of our 26 protons in 13 helium atoms, three helium atoms (6 protons) were fused into a carbon atom, resulting in 1 carbon atom and 10 helium atoms.\n\nAfter another few hundred thousand years of burning helium into carbon at the core of the aging star, helium became depleted at the core, and the reaction rate again began to fall. This caused another round of core collapse, speed-up of atoms, and soaring temperatures, enabling fusion of carbon to helium, producing oxygen (8 protons).\n\nThe same cycle repeated several more times, but with the protons rapidly forming larger and larger groups, there were correspondingly fewer and fewer possible reactions, and the time of each cycle was reduced dramatically. Oxygen atoms combined with helium to create neon, neon with helium to create magnesium, and similarly through the production of silicon, sulfur, argon, calcium, titanium, chromium, and finally \u2013 iron. Each iron atom contains 26 protons. The entire sequence starting at silicon lasted less than a day. As each larger atom fused, less and less energy was released in the reaction relative to the amount of energy needed to cause the reaction.\n\nWhen, at last, iron started fusing to helium, more energy was consumed than was produced \u2013 and the star was dramatically COOLED. This caused the final, disastrous collapse of the star's core, with the entire core rushing to the star's center in a matter of seconds. The temperature exceeded several hundred billion degrees, and a chaotic fusion process in which any atom can fuse to any other atom ensued. In less than a second the energy equivalent of billions of stars was released, and the star became a supernova.\n\nThis star died dramatically. Our 26 protons in the iron atom were blown clear of the star, while the center collapsed into a black hole.\n\nFor the next 9 billion years, the iron atom traveled through interstellar space and intermingled with other clouds of hydrogen, helium, and the remains of other supernovas. At last, it found itself in another vast cloud of gas \u2013 this time laced with atoms heavier than hydrogen and helium, and dust. And this cloud slowly began to shrink upon itself, attracted by its own gravity toward its center. And the iron atom fell inward as well\u2026\n\nHydrogen fusion started in the core of this shrinking cloud, and a smaller star was created. The dust and heavier elements formed rocks orbiting this star, and those rocks crashed into one another, slowly building planets. Our iron atom became a part of one of those rocks. After about a billion years, a system of eight planets had stabilized, but our iron atom remained part of a large rock for another billion years.\n\nAbout 2 billion years ago, the rock containing our 26 protons in an iron atom crashed through the atmosphere of the third innermost planet around the star, and exploded in mid-air, sending our iron atom into the sea. After two billion years of geological transformations, the iron atom entered the surface soil in a farming area, and about a year ago made it into the feed on a beef farm. The atom, bonded into a complex bio-organic compound in the muscles of a steer, was inside the hamburger I ate last night, and now flows in the blood of my veins.\n\nAlthough parts of this tale are approximated due to uncertainty in the exact history of iron atoms reaching Earth, the basic fact remains \u2013 all of the atoms of which you and I are made, and which surround us on this planet (apart from hydrogen) were formed in ancient supernovae of stars formed very shortly after the emergence of the universe.

At its peak, it glowed with the luminosityluminosity, in astronomy, the rate at which energy of all types is radiated by an object in all directions. A star's luminosity depends on its size and its temperature, varying as the square of the radius and the fourth power of the absolute surface temperature. of 100 million suns. \"We had seen nothing like this since the time of [astronomers] Tycho and Kepler,\" says Stanford E. WoosleyStanford E. Woosley (born December 8, 1944) is a physicist, and Professor of Astronomy and Astrophysics. He is the director of the Center for Supernova Research at UCSC. He has published over 300 papers. of the University of California, Santa Cruz The University of California, Santa Cruz, also known as UC Santa Cruz or UCSC, is a public, collegiate university, one of the ten campuses of the University of California. .\n\nIn addition to observing X rays, radio waves, and a bright dot of light briefly visible to the naked eye, astronomers in 1987 detected gamma rays from a supernova for the first time. As debris from the explosion ballooned into surrounding space, they also tracked the early stages of the supernova's evolution.\n\nNow, a decade later, 1987A has dimmed considerably in visible light; however, it brightened recently at X-ray and radio wavelengths. As astronomers look forward to 2007, when they predict the shock wave from the exploded star will generate new celestial pyrotechnicspyrotechnics(p\u012b'r\u014dt\u0115k`n\u012dks, p\u012b'r\u0259\u2013), technology of making and using fireworks. Gunpowder was used in fireworks by the Chinese as early as the 9th cent. , they continue to grapple with to enter into contest with, resolutely and courageously.\n\nSee also: Grapple two puzzles.\n\nOn the same day that photographic plates captured the first visible-light image of 1987A, a set of underground detectors recorded a handful of neutrinos from the explosion. The neutrinos arrived within 10 seconds of each other. Detection of these subatomic particles thrilled astrophysicists because it confirmed their basic theory about supernovas.\n\nAccording to the standard model, when an aging star more massive than eight suns finally succumbs to gravity, its core implodes and a shock wave racing out from the collapsed interior ejects the star's outer layers. The remaining core, which is so dense that protons and electrons are pushed together, is known as a neutron star. As it forms, a neutron star emits a brief, but intense, burst of neutrinos.\n\nSince the triumphal detection of the neutrinos, however, astronomers have seen neither hide nor hair of the neutron star. They had expected that its rapid rotation would produce radio waves or that material falling onto it would produce X rays.\n\nSuch emissions from the core of the supernova remnant couldn't have been seen directly, but they should have added to the total energy spewed out by the supernova. All of the radiation emitted by supernova 1987A, however, can be accounted for by the radioactive decay of heavy elements forged during the supernova explosion. If the neutron star exists, it's unusually silent. Some astrophysicists argue that the neutron star's emissions are hidden by dense material surrounding the body. Other researchers conjecture that gas hurled into space during the explosion fell back onto the newly forged neutron star. If the star already had the maximum amount of mass it could hold, the additional material might have transformed it into a black hole, notes Roger Chevalier of the University of Virginia in Charlottesville. Subsequent material falling onto a black hole might not emit significant amounts of radiation.\n\nThe other puzzling aspect of 1987A concerns a group of three rings that surround the supernova. The innermost ring, which has a radius of about 1 light-year, encircles the center of the explosion. The two outer rings, which lie on opposite sides of the inner ring, complete an hourglasshourglass, glass instrument for measuring time, usually consisting of two bulbs united by a narrow neck. One bulb is filled with fine sand that runs through the neck into the other bulb in an hour's time. shape, with the inner ring as its waist.

Evidence suggests that as recently as 20,000 years before its demise, the aging star had swollen to some 100 times its normal diameter and had become what astronomers call a red supergiant.

The red supergiant shrank and became a blue supergiant, a star considerably less swollen but, at 10 times its original diameter, still far from svelte.\n\nThe blue supergiant ejected a high-speed wind that eventually caught up with the sluggish material expelled by the star in its previous, red supergiant incarnation. When the blue wind ran into the red wind, it swept the material up into dense clumps that became the three gaseous rings.\n\nSoon after the explosion, ultraviolet radiation from the supernova ionizedi\u00b7on\u00b7ize tr. & intr.v.i\u00b7on\u00b7ized, i\u00b7on\u00b7iz\u00b7ing, i\u00b7on\u00b7iz\u00b7es To convert or be converted totally or partially into ions.\n\ni gas in the rings. As the gas cooled and recombined with the electrons, it emitted the light seen as rings by .\n\nThat simple scenario works well, says Chevalier, up to a point. It explains why the shock wave from 1987A-unlike that from other supernovas-didn't light up its immediate surroundings. There simply wasn't much material there. The blue supergiant's fast wind had already cleared out a cavity. The model also explains why the supernova remnant, after fading, would start radiating more radio waves and X rays. As the expanding shock wave from the explosion ventured farther out and slammed into denser material beyond the blue supergiant's wind, it accelerated electrons to high speeds, causing them to emit radiation. The denser material, in fact, slowed the shock wave from one-tenth the speed of light to less than one-sixtieth.\n\nThis model can't explain, however, why the material swept up by the fast wind should form rings instead of a spherical shell. Researchers, including Richard McCray Boulder, suggest that the wind expelled by the red supergiant blew stronger in some directions than others. One explanation for an uneven wind is that influence of an unseen companion star may have directed it. No one has seen evidence of such a companion, but astronomers will continue to look as the supernova grows dimmerdim\u00b7mer n. 1.

Alternatively, if the red supergiant rotated rapidly, it would have forced material to be blown asymmetrically.\n\nRecent Hubble images of the supernova debris, displayed last month at a meeting of the American Astronomical Society The American Astronomical Society (AAS, sometimes pronounced \"double-A-S\") is a US society of professional astronomers and other interested individuals, headquartered in Washington, DC. in Toronto, show a dumbbell Dumbbell shape consisting of two connected blobs of debris flying apart at nearly 10 million kilometers per hour. The blobs are moving perpendicularly to the plane of the rings, suggesting that whatever property of the red supergiant created the rings may also have influenced the explosion, says Jason Pun of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center The Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) is a major NASA space research laboratory established on May 1, 1959 as NASA's first space flight center. GSFC employs approximately 10,000 civil servants and contractors, and is located approximately 6.5 miles northeast of Washington, D.C. in Greenbelt, Md. Two new instruments installed Feb. 15 on Hubble should provide further details on the velocities and shapes of the blobs.\n\nAstronomers expect the supernova's fading image to experience a renaissance 10 years from now. At that time, they predict, debris from the supernova will strike the inner ring. Unlike the explosion a decade ago, this one will require a telescope in order to be seen. In colliding with the ring, says McCray, the supernova will shed light on material from its past and may help astronomers to predict its future.\n\nCOPYRIGHT 1997 Science Service, Inc.\nNo portion of this article can be reproduced without the express written permission from the copyright holder."}

The study of the coolant deaths of these stars offers another way to learn about the first stars.\n\nThe Origin of Galaxies and Large-Scale Structure\n\nThe small protogalactic fragments containing the first stars were embedded in halos of dark matter, which formed first and provided most of the total mass. Through their mutual gravitational attraction, these small fragments of gas and dark matter would have fallen slowly toward other such objects, collided, and then merged into larger objects.

{"text": "underestimated the luminous matter in the galaxy?\n\nTradBut it occurs to me that the calculation of how much luminous matter there is in the galaxy is based on a measurement of how much light the galaxy puts out, multiplied by a factor based on certain assumptions about what percentage of stars fall into the super-bright category and what percentage of stars fall into the super-dim category. A hot star like Sirius A, for example, will contribute 23 times as much light as the sun but only 2.3 times as much mass as the sun. A red dwarf star like Proxima Centauri, on the other hand, will contribute only 1/10,000 as much visible light as the sun, but will weigh in at a sizeable 1/10 the sun's mass. Therefore, an accurate estimate of how much luminous matter there is in the galaxy depends severely on an accurate survey of how many red dwarfs there are. An enormous number of red dwarfs would only make a tiny contribution to the total luminosity of the galaxy.\n\nWell ... according to this article, which came out earlier this year, it seems we may indeed have underestimated the percentage of stars in the galaxy that are red dwarfs. Look at this passage:\n\nThe most surprising result of RECONS so far is the realization of the extent to which red dwarfs are the real rulers of the universe, both in numbers and total mass. Within 10 parsecs of the Sun there are no hot, bright O and B stars, just 4 white A stars and 6 yellow-white F stars, 21 G stars similar to our Sun, 45 orange K dwarfs \u2014 and a whopping 236 cool, orange-red M dwarfs like Proxima Centauri (which still ranks as the Sun's closest neighbor). There are also 20 white dwarfs. That means that for every other star in the universe, there are no less than 2.5 red M dwarfs.\n\nHow does this new, upwardly-revised estimate of the number of red dwarfs affect our calculations as to what percentage of the galaxy's mass is made up of luminous matter? Does it mean that the old 10% figure should be revised upward to 15%? 20%? 30%?! And since this also means that the percentage of dark matter in the galaxy must now be revised downward, how far does this go toward solving the Dark Matter riddle?\n\nWell, the amount of exotic dark matter vs. regular matter (luminous and dark) in the universe was found independent of galactic observations, so how much DM we see (well, don't see) in the galaxy may not help us a whole lot in figuring out what it is.\n\nWhat this could do is give us a better idea on the amount of luminous matter in the universe. It should be noted that that amount is ~10%, which is very likely related to your galactic figure above.\n\nNow, as to how this figure should be changed (and we really need a bigger survey, IMO, that would get a good sample of O/B stars in addition to M-dwarfs to get a good feel for numbers of stars), I don't know what the previous M-dwarf ratio was, so I don't know how it changed. That would tell us how much the percentage of luminous matter should increase.\n\nThis isn't news at all. Astronomers have long known that about 80 percent of all stars in the Galaxy are red dwarfs. See, for example, the stellar pyramid on page 79 of Ken Croswell's book Planet Quest, which gives the following statistics:\n\nActually, stars DO make up most of the normal (baryonic) matter of the Milky Way. Interstellar gas and dust account for only about 5 to 10 billion solar masses of material in the Galaxy.\n\nAre you sure? Can you provide a citation? It's not that I don't believe you, it's just that you have contradicted what I had come to belive and I would like confirmation before I shift my paradigm!\n\n\"The space between the stars looks empty, which is what it mostly is. A cubic centimeter of terrestrial air packs 25 million million million molecules, but the same volume of interstellar space in the Galactic disk typically holds just a single atom--by laboratory standards, a perfect vacuum. However, the Galaxy is so big that if you added up all this tenuous material, its total mass would equal 5 to 10 billion stars like the Sun--approximately 5 to 10 percent of the mass of the Galactic disk.\"\n--Magnificent Universe by Ken Croswell, page 54.\n\nTracer: TradThe luminous matter seems pretty well accounted for, but a related question is whether or not we have underestimated the baryonic dark matter in galaxies.\n\nI assume that you're referring to tthe galaxy from the way your question is stated. We know two things: galactic rotation curves (velocity vs. radius) are flat through the disk into the halo and we do not see enough mass in luminous matter (i.e. stars). We know that dark matter exits in some form, since *we* are dark matter. (No telescope somewhere else will pick up the radiation we and the earth are emitting.) However, we also do not see evidence around here for enough normal (or baryonic, like drguss said) dark matter to make up the missing mass that must be there to make the galaxies rotate at the observed velocities. This leads us to believe that there must be something else out there making up the dark mass.\n\nAs a final note, going beyond galaxies, WMAP observations of the cosmic microwave background have told us how much baryonic matter, (exotic) dark matter, and dark energy are in the universe. These observation corroborate the dark matter theory originially based on the galactic evidence.\n\nI'm wondering about something. Has evidence of dark matter really been found or is it just used to account for the missing mass?\n\nMany spiral galaxies have flat rotation curves . If the visible mass was all there was you would expect a fall-off of velocity with distance from the core. That is what is not observed so there is evidence for some unseen matter that is \"dark\". that have yet to be detected but may exist based upon particle physics. The \"Cold Dark Matter\" models you often hear about are referring to the non-baryonic forms of dark matter.\n\nTobin Dax noted that WMAP and Big Bang parameters in general seem to restrict most dark matter to the non-baryonic forms. But is important to stress that this conclusion is based upon a combination of observations and Big Bang requirements. The universe is not obligated to conform to those requirements. Some researchers have pointed to observations that suggest the dark matter may actually be entirely baryonic in nature - which conflicts with the currently preferred version of the Big Bang (concordance model --> dark energy = 73%, non-baryonic dark matter =23%, baryonic matter = 4%). So the actual census of baryonic dark matter is an important test for the concordance model.\n\nOne interesting recent result is that many elliptical galaxies have a dearth of dark matter. Other problems include observations that indicate a coupling between dark matter halos and luminous matter unexpected in CDM models.\n\nThat's why it is important to keep in mind that what the observations indicate about dark matter are more important than what any one theory says the dark matter must be. that have yet to be detected but may exist based upon particle physics. The \"Cold Dark Matter\" models you often hear about are referring to the non-baryonic forms of dark matter.\n\nGaaah! I thought I'd finally gotten the different varieties of dark matter sorted out, but I had the impression that the cold dark matter was baryonic, while hot dark matter was non-baryonic, perhaps neutrinos or something like that. And where does exotic dark matter fit into this, or is it just a synonym for one of the above, or a more specific variety?\nAs for dark energy, that's what might eventually rend the universe apart, right? Does it seem to be exerting a gravitational attraction meanwhile? If so, does that seem to be part of what's keeping galaxies together?\n\n...As for dark energy, that's what might eventually rend the universe apart, right? Does it seem to be exerting a gravitational attraction meanwhile? If so, does that seem to be part of what's keeping galaxies together?\n\nThe expansion rate may be the sum of two forces. As the universe expands, the gravitational force becomes less effective allowing the dark energy force to dominate. Acceleration would be the result.\n\nIf this is true, would the \"Hubble Constant\" become refined to an equation and not a \"constant\"?\n\nThere are several independent classes of observation attesting to the existence of dark matter; this paper gives an overview, from both observational and theoretical perspective.\n\nIn brief:\n- rotation curves of galaxies (as already noted by several posters)\n- gravitational lensing, both strong and weak (here is an excellent recent, HST + X-ray + ground-based study of the distribution of dark matter in an Abell cluster)\n- motion of galaxies in the Local Group\n- X-ray emission from some clusters (-> high-temperature gas; if in equilbrium, needs far more mass than that implied by light from galaxies in the cluster)\n- large-scale streaming (e.g. towards the Great Attractor)"}

{"text": "Messages from the Abyss\n\nMany neutron stars are surrounded by accretion disks. The disks are often made up of matter pulled in by the neutron star's gravity from a companion star in a binary system. Over time, the neutron stars can swallow so much additional material that they collapse into black holes.\n\nRecently, research associate Bruno Giacomazzo and Fellow Rosalba Perna studied this collapse process in detail. They modeled how an accretion disk affects a neutron star's collapse into a black hole. Their model included an analysis of the kinds of signals that would be emitted by neutron stars with and without accretion disks as they collapsed into black holes.\n\nThe researchers were a little disappointed to discover that the gravitational wave signal would likely be similar for an accretion-induced collapse and the collapse of a \"naked\" neutron star. However, they were excited to find that the two kinds of collapses would send very different electromagnetic signals such as short bursts of gamma rays.\n\nThe variations in electromagnetic signals stem from differences in what happens immediately following the collapse into a black hole. When a neutron star with an accretion disk collapses, it leaves behind some of its accretion disk. The newly formed black hole voraciously swallows the surviving disk, which can launch relativistic jets and emit short bursts of gamma rays in the process of growing rapidly. Thus, accretion-induced collapse of neutron stars could be responsible for some of the short gamma-ray bursts observed in our Universe. In contrast, when a \"naked\" neutron star collapses into a black hole, almost no ordinary matter is left anywhere near the new black hole. Thus, nothing happens in this kind of collapse to generate bursts of gamma rays (or any other electromagnetic signals).\n\nBy identifying and interpreting gamma-ray \"messages from the abyss,\" researchers now have a way to locate accretion-induced collapses of neutron stars \u2014 even when they occur far outside our own Galaxy."}

A study of star forming region W5 by the sun-orbiting Spitzer Space Telescope provides clear clues by recording that massive stars near the center of empty cavities are older than stars near the edges. A likely reason for this is that the older stars in the center are actually triggering the formation of the younger edge stars. The triggered star formation occurs when hot outflowing gas compresses cooler gas into knots dense enough to gravitationally contract into stars. Spectacular pillars, left slowly evaporating from the hot outflowing gas, provide further visual clues. In the above scientifically-colored infrared image, red indicates heated dust, while white and green indicate particularly dense gas clouds.

Well beyond the orbits of the outer planets, Voyager 1 is believed to be entering the realm of deep space near the edge of the heliosphere, the region dominated by the solar wind and magnetic field. Causing some debate, new results from instruments still operating have given indications that the spacecraft could finally be encountering a fluctuating boundary known as the solar wind's termination shock. Illustrated above, the bubble-shaped termination shock is produced when the wind from the Sun slows dramatically and piles up as it runs in to the tenuous interstellar gas. Still farther out, beyond the heliopause, solar wind and interstellar gas begin to mix, while the heliosphere's motion through interstellar space creates a bow shock, analogous to a boat moving through water. Estimates are that both Voyager 1 and 2 have enough power and fuel to operate until about the year 2020. The spacecraft continue to coast toward interstellar space at over 3 AU per year.\n\nBeautiful and bright, the 2002 Leonid meteors battled against glaring moonlight. This winning example, from Tuesday morning skies above Laughlin, Nevada, USA, finds an undaunted Leonid streaking between the familiar constellation of Orion (left) and an overexposed full Moon. As anticipated, the Leonid shower packed a double punch on November 19 with planet Earth plunging through two dense clouds of meteroids, dusty debris left by the passage of comet Tempel-Tuttle. Some European observers reported 10 or so meteors a minute during the first peak near 4:00 Universal Time while North American skygazers witnessed slightly lower rates near the second peak around 10:30 UT. Overall, observed rates were much lower than last year's Leonid meteor storm, but for many the sky was still filled with a rewarding spectacle of bright meteors. And that performance may be a fond farewell for years to come. The annual Leonid meteor shower will not likely approach even these rates again until the end of this century.\n\nAs meteor after meteor streaked across a moonless sky, photographers across the world snapped pictures of the 2001 Leonids Meteor Shower. Many recognized this as the best meteor shower they had ever seen. In fact, the 2001 Leonids was the most active meteor shower since the mid-1960s. The above photo captures three Leonid meteors crossing a photogenic star-field. On the far right is the Pleiades star cluster. The brightest meteor crosses right in front of the Hyades star cluster, situated below the image center. Just left of center is the bright planet Saturn, and the bright star below Saturn is Aldebaran. The ten-minute exposure was taken near Victoria, British Columbia, Canada at 2:45 am PST on 2001 November 18.\n\nThe Leonid Meteor Shower this year could be described as good but not great. During November 17 and 18 the Earth crossed through several streams of sand-sized grit left orbiting the Sun by Comet Tempel-Tuttle. Several distinct peaks in meteor activity were reported, with rates approaching 400 meteors per hour for brief periods for some dark locations. Pictured above, a Leonid meteor was caught from Florida streaking through the constellation of Orion on the morning of 2000 November 18. Visible as a red-tinged smudge to the left of the three nearly linear stars that compose Orion's belt is the picturesque star-forming region known as the Orion Nebula. Next year, the Leonids Meteor Shower is expected by many to be much more active.\n\nA dim double star system cataloged as Gliese 623 lies 25 light-years from Earth, in the constellation of Hercules. The individual stars of this binary system were distinguished for the first time when the Hubble Space Telescope's Faint Object Camera recorded this image in June 1994. They are separated by 200 million miles - about twice the Earth/Sun distance. On the right, the fainter Gliese 623b is 60,000 times less luminous than the Sun and approximately 10 times less massive. The fuzzy rings around its brighter companion, Gliese 623a, are image artifacts. The lowest mass stars are classified as red dwarf stars, but even red dwarfs are massive enough to trigger hydrogen fusion in their cores to sustain their feeble starlight. Slightly less massive objects, known as brown dwarfs, can shine only briefly as their central temperatures are too low to utilize hydrogen as nuclear fuel. The present estimates of the mass of Gliese 623b are right at this red dwarf/brown dwarf border but future observations should help clarify the nature of one of our Galaxy's small stars. Dim and difficult to detect, an abundance of objects like Gl623b has been proposed as a possible solution to the mystery of \"Dark Matter\" in the Universe.\n\n\"Goodness, Gracious, Green Balls Of Fire!\", might have been an appropriate theme song title for the 1998 Leonid meteor shower. Many observers, like astrophotographer Steve Dunn watching from Cape Canaveral, Florida, USA, reported that a lot of the characteristically bright Leonid meteors had a greenish tint. Around 6:00 AM EST on November 17, he photographed this dazzling Leonid fireball leaving a striking green-to-white trail against a background of stars in the constellation Coma Berenices. Dunn comments that he considers himself a green novice observer, but is now anticipating next November's appearance of the Leonids shower.\n\nTwisted magnetic fields arching from the solar surface can trap ionized gas, suspending it in huge looping structures. These majestic plasma arches are seen as prominences above the solar limb. On September 14, this dramatic and detailed image was recorded by the EIT experiment on board the space-based SOHO observatory in the light emitted by ionized Helium. It shows hot plasma escaping into space as a fiery prominence breaks free from magnetic confinement a hundred thousand miles above the Sun. These awesome events bear watching as they can affect communications and power systems ninety three million miles away on Planet Earth.\n\nWhat mysteries might be solved by peering into this crystal ball? This crystal ball is quite unusual because it is actually a moon of Jupiter, the crystals are ice-crystals, and the ball is not only dirty and opaque but cracked beyond repair. Nevertheless, speculation is rampant that oceans exist under these tortured ice-plains that could support life. Europa, the smallest of Jupiter's Galilean moons, was photographed last month in natural color by the robot spacecraft Galileo, now in orbit around Jupiter. The brown patches are what one might think: dirt -- tainting an otherwise white ice-crust. Europa, nearly the same size as Earth's Moon, similarly keeps one face toward its home planet. The hemisphere of Europa shown above is the one that always trails. Why is Europa's surface the smoothest in the Solar System? Where are Europa's craters?\n\nDensely packed stars in the core of the globular cluster M15 are shown in this Hubble Space Telescope (HST) image taken in April of 1994. The stars revealed are contained in an area 1.6 light years across and their colors roughly indicate their temperatures - hot stars appear blue, cooler stars look reddish-orange. M15 has long been recognized as one of the densest cluster of stars in our galaxy outside of the galactic center itself. Even the unprecedented resolving power of the HST cameras could not separate the individual stars in its innermost regions. However, this HST image reveals that the density of stars continues to rise toward the cluster's core, suggesting that a sudden, runaway collapse due to the gravitational attraction of many closely packed stars or a single central massive object, perhaps a black hole, could account for the core's extreme density.\n\nAs I was admiring the great Hubble image of Stephan's Quintet, I was thinking that the image would have been even better if it had shown emission nebulae. (Actually, I can spot a bit of blue-green in parts of foreground galaxy NGC 7320, but these blue-green spots and knots don't stand out well against the broad blue spiral arms where they are found.) If these emission nebula had been shown as red they would have stood out so much better, and it would have been so much easier to tell how many very young stars the galaxies contain, as opposed to stars which are merely bluer and younger than the Sun.\n\nAs I searched the Hubble Legacy Archive, I found that it does indeed contain Ha data both for nearby NGC 7320 (where 656 nm has been redshifted to 657 nm) and for much more distant galaxy NGC 7318B, the galaxy in Stephan's Quintet which has set off the most brilliant fireworks (where, if I understand the data correctly, the Ha line has been redshifted to 665 nm).\n\nCheck out this page to find Hubble data about Stephan's Quintet. The second picture from the top in the right-hand column appears to show Ha data.\n\nSo it would have been possible to process the Hubble data so that it had shown the red emission nebulae of Stephan's Quintet. It would have been so nice if Hunter Wilson had included the Ha data - not that he didn't do a splendid job anyway."}

{"text": "Tag: neutron stars\n\nThe Carina nebula is a sprawling, monstrous complex of gas located a mere 7500 light years from Earth. Hundreds of light years across, it's massive enough to create thousands of stars like the Sun. Tens of thousands.\n\nAnd churn out stars it does. Embedded in the nebula are several clusters of newborn stars, and many of these stars are so massive they're nearly at the limit of how big a star can be without tearing itself apart. Stars that big explode as supernovae, and a new mosaic by the orbiting Chandra X-ray Observatory indicate they've been popping off in the nebula for quite some time:\n\n[Click to enchandrasekharlimitenate.]\n\nThis image is pretty amazing: it's a mosaic of 22 separate images by Chandra, covering 1.4 square degrees (seven times the area of the full Moon on the sky), and represents an exposure time of 1.2 million seconds! Since it shows X-rays coming from astronomical objects, it's false color: red is from lower energy X-rays, green is medium energy, and blue from the highest energy photons.\n\nThe diffuse glow is from two sources: the stellar winds from those massive stars slamming into surrounding ambient gas at high speed, and from the shock waves generated when supernovae explode. Both are extremely high-energy events, and produce copious amounts of X-rays. That long, horizontal arc is probably the edge of a bubble, a shell of gas piled up from the winds of stars and supernovae like snow piled up in front of a snowplow.\n\nThat's evidence right there that Carina has been cranking out supernovae over the past few million years. Interestingly, it's what's missing that provides more proof. Read More\n\nThis really is a fantastic demonstration of how microscale weather works. Imagine: a fire starts. As the air is heated above the fire, it rises, and the upward motion can be very strong. This leaves a lower pressure spot at the fire, and the air from outside the fire rushes in to fill the gap. The air is very turbulent, and as the inward-moving air from one side hits air coming in from the other, swirls can form. These get amplified by the constant gale of air, and rotation on a larger scale can get started and sustained. The whirlwind gets pumped by the hot air rising, and the next thing you know you've got a full-blown tornado of fire. Read More\n\nIt's a (Bruce) banner moment for NASA's new Fermi satellite: it's found a pulsar that emits only gamma rays.\n\nBrief background: when a massive star explode, its core collapses. If it has enough mass, the core shrinks down into a black hole. If it doesn't have quite that much oomph (if it has about 1 \u2013 2.8 times the mass of the Sun) it forms a weird object called a neutron star. As massive as a star but only a few kilometers across, a neutron star is incredibly dense, rapidly rotating, and has a magnetic field intense enough to give you an MRI from a million kilometers away.\n\nOK, I made that last one up, but in fact it sounds about right. The point: neutron stars are seriously awesome, right on the edge of matter as we understand it.\n\nThe supercharged magnetic field channels a tremendously powerful flow of energy away from the star in twin beams like a lighthouse. And, like a lighthouse, as the star rotates these beams sweep around. If they're aimed at Earth we see a pair of pulses every time the star spins around once. So, duh, we call these special neutron stars pulsars. You can see a way cool animation of this on NASA's Conceptual Image Lab web page.\n\nUsually, the beams from these pulsars contain light from all (or nearly all) across the electromagnetic spectrum. We seem them in radio waves, visible light, ultraviolet, even X-rays and some in gamma rays. The processes that create these beams are pretty fierce and weird, and the type of light emitted depends on the process. However, in general, if we see high energy light (like X- and gamma rays) from a pulsar, we tend to see it in lower energy light (optical and radio) as well.\n\nBut Fermi found an oddball! Located about 4600 light years away in the constellation of Cepheus, CTA-1 is a supernova remnant, the expanding debris from an exploding star. But that expanding junk is only from the outer layers of the detonated star: the core collapsed down into a neutron star, and that's what Fermi detected. This newly discovered gamma-ray-only pulsar spins three times per second \u2014 think on that; an object with the mass of an entire star spinning at that rate! \u2014 and is blasting out gamma radiation with 1000 times the Sun's entire energy output.\n\nAnd all of it in super-high energy invisible gamma rays. The Hulk has nothing on this pulsar.\n\nActually, let's pause for just a sec. Is it sunny outside? Good. Go outside, and hold your hand up. Feel the warmth? That's just a bit of optical light warming your hand. Now think about how much energy is falling over the entire Earth itself, a gazillion times the size of your hand. Now think about how much energy the Sun is emitting in all directions; the entire Earth only intercepts about one-two billionths of that light. Now think about one thousand times that much energy. Now think of all that energy being only in the form of DNA-shattering gamma rays.\n\nYeah, now you're getting it. This object is seriously freaky.\n\nWe know of about 1800 pulsars, and all of them emit radio waves. All but this guy. It's a brand new category of object (well, a sub category, but still), a new character on the cosmic stage. But why does it only emit gamma rays? Hey, good question. I don't know the answer (and the press release doesn't say, in fact). I suspect the answer right now is, we don't know. This object was only discovered a little while ago, and worse, gamma rays are really difficult to study. That's why we launched Fermi in the first place! Worse even than that, without being able to look at this object in radio, optical, or any other form of light really hobbles our ability to study it.\n\nFor now, I think we'll have to rely on Fermi's observations and then look at theoretical models. I imagine there will be astronomers all over the world pouncing on this, trying to figure out how the magnetic fields of the star can be so choosy (maybe they're elitist).\n\nBut until then, as usual, I have to wonder: if we only just now found this object, what the heck else is floating around out there just waiting for us to find?"}
{"text": "Science News\n\nMost Powerful Eruption In The Universe Discovered\n\nJan. 6, 2005 \u2014 Astronomers have found the most powerful eruption in the universe using NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory. A super massive black hole generated this eruption by growing at a remarkable rate. This discovery shows the enormous appetite of large black holes, and the profound impact they have on their surroundings.\n\nShare This:\n\nThe huge eruption was seen in a Chandra image of the hot, X-ray emitting gas of a galaxy cluster called MS 0735.6+7421. Two vast cavities extend away from the super massive black hole in the cluster's central galaxy. The eruption, which has lasted for more than 100 million years, has generated energy equivalent to hundreds of millions of gamma-ray bursts.\n\nThis event was caused by gravitational energy release, as enormous amounts of matter fell toward a black hole. Most of the matter was swallowed, but some of it was violently ejected before being captured by the black hole. \"I was stunned to find that a mass of about 300 million suns was swallowed,\" said Brian McNamara of Ohio University in Athens. \"This is as large as another super massive black hole.\" He is lead author of the study about the discovery, which is in the January 6, 2005, issue of Nature.\n\nAstronomers are not sure where such large amounts of matter came from. One theory is gas from the host galaxy catastrophically cooled and was swallowed by the black hole. The energy released shows the black hole in MS 0735 has grown dramatically during this eruption. Previous studies suggest other large black holes have grown very little in the recent past, and that only smaller black holes are still growing quickly.\n\n\"This new result is as surprising as it is exciting,\" said co-author Paul Nulsen of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, Cambridge, Mass. \"This black hole is feasting, when it should be fasting.\"\n\nRadio emission within the cavities shows jets from the black hole erupted to create the cavities. Gas is being pushed away from the black hole at supersonic speeds over a distance of about a million light-years. The mass of the displaced gas equals about a trillion suns, more than the mass of all the stars in the Milky Way.\n\nThe rapid growth of super massive black holes is usually detected by observing very bright radiation from the centers of galaxies in the optical and X-ray wavebands, or luminous radio jets. In MS 0735 no bright central radiation is found, and the radio jets are faint. The true nature of MS 0735 is only revealed through X-ray observations of the hot cluster gas.\n\n\"Until now we had no idea this black hole was gorging itself,\" said co-author Michael Wise of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Mass. \"The discovery of this eruption shows X-ray telescopes are necessary to understand some of the most violent events in the universe.\"\n\nThe astronomers estimated how much energy was needed to create the cavities by calculating the density, temperature and pressure of the hot gas. By making a standard assumption that 10 percent of the gravitational energy goes into launching the jets, they estimated how much material the black hole swallowed.\n\nBesides generating the cavities, some of the energy from this eruption should keep the hot gas around the black hole from cooling, and some of it may also generate large-scale magnetic fields in the galaxy cluster. Chandra observers have discovered other cavities in galaxy clusters, but this one is easily the largest and the most powerful still from an animation depict an eruption caused by a supermassive black hole. Gas and dust seen in a reddish-brown disk are being pulled around by the enormous gravity of the supermassive black hole, which is buried in the center of a large elliptical galaxy.

{"text": "2. The model\n\nWe consider a C-O white dwarf accreting matter from a companion\nwith solar chemical composition (X=0.7, Y=0.28, Z=0.02). For the\noutcome of the evolution, we only consider the Chandrasekhar-mass SN\nIa explosion of the white dwarf with an initial mass less than\n. The companion star is assumed to be\nlobe-filling, and mass transfer occurs through Roche-lobe overflow.\nDetached systems like symbiotic stars, in which the companion star of\nthe white dwarf loses mass via a wind, are not taken into account, due\nto the deficiency of massive white dwarfs among such systems, and\nhence the low frequency ( yr-1) of\nSNe Ia (Yungelson et al. 1995).\n\nThe system can be specified by three parameters: the initial white\ndwarf mass , the initial donor mass\nand the orbital period\nat the beginning of mass transfer. We have followed the evolution of\nthese binary systems for various sets of these parameters, using an\nupdated version of the evolution code developed by Eggleton\n(1971).\n\nWhether the white dwarf can grow in mass is determined by the\n\"accumulation ratio\" , the fraction of the\naccreted hydrogen that converts into elements heavier than helium. The\nvalue of is related to mass loss from the white\ndwarf during hydrogen and helium burning, i.e.,\n, where and\nare the fraction of the transferred mass\naccumulated during hydrogen and helium burning, respectively.\n\nIt has been shown (e.g. Nomoto et al. 1979; Fujimoto 1982) that\nsteady hydrogen burning on the white dwarf surface can occur when\n, where is the mass\ntransfer rate, yr-1 and\n(note that even in this stable burning\nsituation, not all of the accreted hydrogen is available for burning,\nbecause some of it can be lost via a radiatively driven wind). As\n, hydrogen burning is unstable and occurs in\nflashes, in which part of the white dwarf envelope may be ejected. For\nthe hydrogen accumulation ratio , we have taken\nthe following assumptions: (1) if , we adopt the\nstrong wind solution by Hachisu et al. (1996), which allows burning of\nhydrogen into helium at a rate limited to , the\nexcess material being blown off in the wind, i.e.,\n; (2) if , we fit the\ndata of the accumulation ratio calculated by Prialnik & Kovetz\n(1995) for hydrogen burning and flashes (for each combination of\nand ) with the following\nconditions: (i) when declines below\nyr-1, a strong nova explosion is\nassumed to occur and no mass accumulates on the surface of the white\ndwarf, that is ; (ii) when\n, .\n\nThe steady hydrogen burning converts hydrogen into helium on top of\nthe C-O white dwarf, and increases the mass of the helium layer\ngradually. When its mass reaches a certain value, helium ignites.\nHelium shell burning is unstable if\nyr-1, and a flash grows, during which part of the envelope\nmass is blown off (Kato, Saio & Hachisu 1989). For the helium\naccumulation ratio , we use the results given by\nKato et al. (1989).\n\nThe evolution of the system is driven by the nuclear evolution of\nthe donor star, and the change of the orbital angular momentum\nof the system mainly caused by wind mass loss\nfrom the white dwarf, which is assumed to leave the system carrying\nthe specific orbital angular momentum of the white dwarf (the mass\nloss in the donor's wind is supposed to be negligible, but its effect\non the change of , i.e., magnetic braking, is\nincluded). In each time step, we numerically calculate the response of\nthe donor radius and the Roche-lobe radius, the difference of which\ndetermines the mass transfer rate, to mass loss from the donor, and\nmass and angular momentum loss from the binary respectively (a\nsemi-analytical method was adopted by Hachisu et al. 1996 and by Di\nStefano and Nelson 1996). The wind decreases both the total mass and\nthe orbital angular momentum of the binary, leading to increase and\ndecrease of the orbital separation, respectively. Thus the stability\nof mass transfer and the secular evolution of the binary sensitively\ndepends on the values of ,\nand the mass ratio.

This cosmic pair is set against millions of glowing stars from the brightest part of the Milky Way -- a region so dense with stars that barely any dark sky is seen across the picture. Credit: ESO\n\nThis part of the constellation of Sagittarius (The Archer) is one of the richest star fields in the whole sky -- the Large Sagittarius Star Cloud.\n\nThe at ESO's La Silla Observatory in Chile.\n\nThis object, a small, isolated dark nebula known as a Bok globule [1], was described as \"a drop of ink on the luminous sky\" by its discoverer Edward Emerson Barnard [2], an American astronomer who discovered and photographed numerous comets, dark nebulae, one of Jupiter's moons, and made many other contributions. An exceptional visual observer and keen astrophotographer, Barnard was the first to use long-exposure photography to explore dark nebulae.\n\nThrough a small telescope Barnard 86 looks like a dearth of stars, or a window onto a patch of distant, clearer sky. However, this object is actually in the foreground of the star field -- a cold, dark, dense cloud made up of small dust grains that block starlight and make the region appear opaque. It is thought to have formed from the remnants of a molecular cloud that collapsed to form the nearby star cluster NGC 6520, seen just to the left of Barnard 86 in this image.\n\nNGC 6520 is an open star cluster that contains many hot stars that glow bright blue-white, a telltale sign of their youth. Open clusters usually contain a few thousand stars that all formed at the same time, giving them all the same age. Such clusters usually only live comparatively short lives, on the order of several hundred million years, before drifting apart.\n\nThe incredible number of stars in this area of the sky muddles observations of this cluster, making it difficult to learn much about it. NGC 6520's age is thought to be around 150 million years, and both this star cluster and its dusty neighbour are thought to lie at a distance of around 6000 light-years from our Sun.\n\nThe stars that appear to be within Barnard 86 in the image above are in fact in front of it, lying between us and the dark cloud. Although it is not certain whether this is still happening within Barnard 86, many dark nebulae are known to have new stars forming in their centres -- as seen in the famous Horsehead Nebula (eso0202 -  the striking object Lupus 3 (eso1303) and to a lesser extent in another of Barnard's discoveries, the Pipe Nebula (eso1233 -  However, the light from the youngest stars is blocked by the surrounding dusty regions, and they can only be seen in infrared or longer-wavelength light.\n\nNotes\n\n[1] Bok globules were first observed in the 1940s by astronomer Bart Bok. They are very cold, dark clouds of gas and dust that often have new stars forming at their centres. These globules are rich in dust that scatters and absorbs background light, so they are almost opaque to visible light"}
{"text": "Tuesday, April 12, 2011\n\nFirst Galaxies Were Born Much Earlier Than Expected, Just 200 Million Years After Big Bang\n\nUsing the amplifying power of a cosmic gravitational lens, astronomers have discovered a distant galaxy whose stars were born unexpectedly early in cosmic history. This result sheds new light on the formation of the first galaxies, as well as on the early evolution of the Universe.\n\nJohan Richard, the lead author of a new study [1] says: \"We have discovered a distant galaxy that began forming stars just 200 million years after the Big Bang. This challenges theories of how soon galaxies formed and evolved in the first years of the Universe. It could even help solve the mystery of how the hydrogen fog that filled the early Universe was cleared.\"\n\nRichard's team spotted the galaxy in recent observations from the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, verified it with observations from the NASA Spitzer Space Telescope and measured its distance using W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii.\n\nThis illustration shows a phenomenon known as gravitational lensing, which is used by astronomers to study very distant and very faint galaxies. Note that the scale has been greatly exaggerated in this diagram. In reality, the distant galaxy is much further away and much smaller.\n\nThe distant galaxy is visible through a cluster of galaxies called Abell 383, whose powerful gravity bends the rays of light almost like a magnifying glass [2]. The chance alignment of the galaxy, the cluster and the Earth amplifies the light reaching us from this distant galaxy, allowing the astronomers to make detailed observations. Without this gravitational lens, the galaxy would have been too faint to be observed even with today's largest telescopes.\n\nAfter spotting the galaxy in Hubble and Spitzer images, the team carried out spectroscopic observations with the Keck-II telescope in Hawaii. Spectroscopy is the technique of breaking up light into its component colours. By analysing these spectra, the team was able to make detailed measurements of its redshift [3] and infer information about the properties of its component stars.\n\nThe giant cluster of elliptical galaxies in the centre of this image contains so much dark matter mass that its gravitational field bends light. This means that for very distant galaxies in the background, the cluster acts as a sort of magnifying glass, bending and concentrating the distant object's light towards Hubble. These gravitational lenses are one tool astronomers can use to extend Hubble's vision beyond what it would normally be capable of seeing.\n\nThe galaxy's redshift is 6.027, which means we see it as it was when the Universe was around 950 million years old [4]. This does not make it the most remote galaxy ever detected \u2014 several have been confirmed at redshifts of more than 8, and one has an estimated redshift of around 10 (heic1103), placing it 400 million years earlier. However the newly discovered galaxy has dramatically different features from other distant galaxies that have been observed, which generally shine brightly with only young stars.\n\n\"When we looked at the spectra, two things were clear,\" explains co-author Eiichi Egami. \"The redshift placed it very early in cosmic history, as we expected. But the Spitzer infrared detection also indicated that the galaxy was made up of surprisingly old and relatively faint stars. This told us that the galaxy was made up of stars already nearly 750 million years old \u2014 pushing back the epoch of its formation to about 200 million years after the Big Bang, much further than we had expected.\"\n\nCo-author Dan Stark continues: \"Thanks to the amplification of the galaxy's light by the gravitational lens, we have some excellent quality data. Our work confirms some earlier observations that had hinted at the presence of old stars in early galaxies. This suggests that the first galaxies have been around for a lot longer than previously thought.\"\n\nThe discovery has implications beyond the question of when galaxies first formed, and may help explain how the Universe became transparent to ultraviolet light in the first billion years after the Big Bang. In the early years of the cosmos, a diffuse fog of neutral hydrogen gas blocked ultraviolet light in the Universe. Some source of radiation must therefore have progressively ionised the diffuse gas, clearing the fog to make it transparent to ultraviolet rays as it is today \u2014 a process known as reionisation.\n\nAstronomers believe that the radiation that powered this reionisation must have come from galaxies. But so far, nowhere near enough of them have been found to provide the necessary radiation. This discovery may help solve this enigma.\n\n\"It seems probable that there are in fact far more galaxies out there in the early Universe than we previously estimated \u2014 it's just that many galaxies are older and fainter, like the one we have just discovered,\" says co-author Jean-Paul Kneib. \"If this unseen army of faint, elderly galaxies is indeed out there, they could provide the missing radiation that made the Universe transparent to ultraviolet light.\"\n\nAs of today, we can only discover these galaxies by observing through massive clusters that act as cosmic telescopes. In coming years, the NASA/ESA/CSA James Webb Space Telescope, scheduled for launch later this decade, will specialise in high resolution observations of distant, highly redshifted objects. It will therefore be in an ideal position to solve this mystery once and for all.\n\nThe Hubble Space Telescope is a project of international cooperation between NASA and ESA.\n\n[1] The research will appear in a paper entitled \"Discovery of a possibly old galaxy at z=6.027, multiply imaged by the massive cluster Abell 383\", to be published in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society. The international team of astronomers in this study consists of Johan Richard (CRAL, Observatoire de Lyon, Universit\u00e9 Lyon 1, France and Dark Cosmology Centre, Niels Bohr Institute, University of Copenhagen, Denmark), Jean-Paul Kneib (Laboratoire d'Astrophysique de Marseille, France), Harald Ebeling (University of Hawaii, USA), Daniel P Stark (University of Cambridge, UK), Eiichi Egami (University of Arizona, USA) and Andrew K Fiedler (University of Arizona, USA). Lead author Johan Richard is a former Marie Curie fellow. The European Union's Marie Curie research fund provides grants at post-graduate and post-doctoral level to encourage mobility among Europe's best researchers. The EU will allocate more than \u20ac4.5 billion through the scheme in 2007-2013.\n\n[2] Gravity distorts space-time, the fabric of the cosmos. This means that for extremely massive objects with very strong gravitational fields, light is visibly bent as it travels through and around them. Massive galaxy clusters like Abell 383 therefore act like an enormous lens, concentrating the light from distant objects behind them, in a process known as gravitational lensing. While the galaxies seen through gravitational lenses are typically distorted and multiply imaged (this newly discovered galaxy is actually visible twice in the Hubble observations), using these gravitational lenses multiplies a telescope's power and lets it see galaxies that would otherwise be too faint to be visible. Abell 383, the gravitational lens used in this study, was imaged as part of the CLASH survey (Cluster Lensing And Supernova survey with Hubble), a Multi Cycle Treasury project to observe a sample of 25 galaxy clusters using Hubble (PI: Marc Postman). Abell 383 is also one of the 50 clusters imaged with the Spitzer Warm mission large project led by Eiichi Egami.\n\n[3] Because the Universe is expanding, the light from distant objects is stretched and reddened as it moves towards us, a phenomenon known as redshift. The further an object is away, the more heavily redshifted it is. For very remote objects, redshift can be used to quantify their distance.\n\n[4] Because light travels at a finite speed, the further away an object is, the further back in time we see it. For an object at a redshift of 6, the light has taken around 12.8 billion years to travel to Earth. Since we know that the Universe is about 13.75 billion years old, this means we are seeing the object in the state it was in less than a billion years after the Big Bang. Redshift is therefore a measure of time elapsed since the Big Bang as well as of an object's distance"}
{"text": "1. HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION\n\nThe study of active galactic nuclei is one of the most rapidly growing\nsubjects in\npresent-day astrophysics. As the sites of the release of energy on the\nmost powerful\nsustained rates and compact scales we know, they clearly are of great\nintrinsic interest.\nAs the most luminous objects we know, they are the best markers we have of the\ndistant reaches of the universe. From both points of view, understanding\ntheir physical\nnature and structure, and thus how to use them to measure cosmological\ndistances\nand times are two of the most important aims of current astrophysical\nresearch. The\ngreatest difficulty in attempting to review work in this field is the\nhuge number of\npapers, covering so many different methods of research, that are being\npublished. An\nexcellent recent book on the subject is Quasar Astronomy by\nWeedman (1986).\n\nThe observational study of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) began with\nFath (1909),\nwho noted in a spectroscopic survey of the brightest spiral `nebulae'\nthat although most\nof them had absorption-line spectra, which he correctly interpreted as\nthe integrated\nlight of large numbers of stars, one, NGC 1068, also had six emission\nlines in its\nspectrum. He recognized them all as characteristic emission lines of\nplanetary nebulae; today we know them as\n[O II] 3727, [Ne III]\n3869,\nH, and [O III]\n4363, 4959, 5007. Other astronomers, especially\nSlipher (1917),\nsoon obtained much better spectra\nof NGC 1068 and of the somewhat similar NGC 4151.\nHubble (1926),\nin his epoch-making paper on the `extragalactic nebulae', emphasized the\nplanetary-nebula-like\nemission-line spectra of three AGNs (as we call them today), NGC 1068, 4051 and\n4151. Then seventeen years later\nSeyfert (1943)\nstudied these and other galaxies,\nand isolated the small fraction of them which show many relatively\nhigh-ionization\nemission lines in their nuclear spectra. These nuclei are invariably\nhighly luminous,\nand their emission lines are wider than the lower-ionization emission\nlines that occur\nin the spectra of the nuclei of many `normal' galaxies, he\nreported. These properties,\nbroad emission lines covering a wide range of ionization, arising in a\nsmall, bright\n(`semi-stellar') nucleus, became the defining characteristics of the\nclass of objects we\ncall Seyfert galaxies, the most numerous known type of AGNs.\n\nThey were very little studied, however, until after the optical\nidentification of\nseveral of the strongest radio sources with galaxies. One of the first\nof these was Cyg A = 3C 405, identified by\nBaade and Minkowski\n(1954)\nwith a cD galaxy at\nredshift z = 0.057. Its rich emission-line spectrum was observed\nto be very similar, in\nline widths and high levels of ionization, to the spectra of Seyfert\ngalaxies. Soon these\ncharacteristic features in the spectrum became the recognized signature\nby which many\n(but not all) radio galaxies could be identified. These are the next\nmost numerous type of AGNs we know, after the Seyfert galaxies.\n\nIn addition to the radio galaxies, a fraction of the early identified\nradio sources\nappeared to be stars, with no trace of a galaxy or nebula in their\nimages. Their spectra\nwere continuous, without absorption lines, but with broad emission lines\nwhich could\nnot be identified. Many attempts were made to understand these `stellar\nradio sources'\nas peculiar stars, perhaps white dwarfs or subdwarfs with highly deviant\nabundances\nof the elements, but no physically consistent interpretation was found\nalong these lines. Then\nSchmidt (1963)\nsolved the puzzle, identifying several well-known nebular\nemission lines with the then unusually large redshift z = 0.158\nin the `stellar' radio\nsource 3C 273. Immediately after this,\nGreenstein and\nMatthews (1963)\nidentified several similar emission lines in 3C 48, with redshift\nz = 0.367. This was larger\nthan the redshift of any galaxy known at the time, but 3C 48 appeared to\nbe a 14th\nmagnitude star. It was immediately clear that both these objects are\nhighly luminous,\nand could be observed to very great distances. They are not stars, but\nquasi-stellar\nradio sources, usually referred to as `quasars'. They are now understood\nto be AGNs,\nso luminous and so distant that the galaxy in which they are cannot (or\ncould not) be\ndetected on available photographic images. Now with CCDs and other high-quantum\nefficiency, linear two-dimensional imaging detectors, the quasi-stellar\nnucleus can be\nsubtracted with good accuracy, revealing the galaxies around many of the nearer\nquasars.\n\nCorresponding radio-quiet high-luminosity stellar-appearing objects were found\nsoon afterwards. At first they were called quasi-stellar objects, or\nQSOs, but gradually\nthe distinction faded out, and they are now referred to simply as\nquasars by most\nresearch workers in the field. In this review we shall often preserve\nthe distinction.\nAs a result of many systematic discovery programs, at present we know\nmany quasars\nand QSOs with redshifts up to z 4, but with a fairly strong\ncutoff around z 3.5,\nso that at the present writing only ten are known with z > 4\n(Schneider et\nal 1989).\nThey are the most distant objects we know in the universe, but there\nappears to be a\nlimit to the distance, or light-travel time, at which we can observe\nthem. They have\na wide range of luminosities. One of the chief aims of AGN research is\nto understand\nthem physically so that the luminosity of an individual object can be\nestimated from\nits spectrum with sufficient accuracy to calculate its distance.\n\nFor rough orientation purposes table 1 lists the\napproximate space densities here\nand now of the various types of AGNs we have discussed, in comparison with\nrepresentative densities of two classes of normal galaxies\n(Osterbrock 1982).\nThe quasars\nand QSOs are the rarest but most luminous types of AGNs; radio and\nSeyfert galaxies\nare more numerous in space but intrinsically less luminous. Observation\nand theory\nalike have made it more and more apparent that QSOs and Seyfert galaxies\nare not\ndifferent types of objects, but rather names we use for AGNs at the high- and\nlow-luminosity ends of a continuous sequence of physically similar\nobjects. In fact\nSchmidt and Green\n(1983)\nhave introduced the terminology that AGNs in galaxies with total\nabsolute magnitude more luminous than MB = -23 are\ncalled quasars (or QSOs),\nwhile those less luminous than MB = -23 are called\nSeyfert galaxies. Note,\nhowever, that to say QSOs and Seyfert galaxy nuclei belong to one\nphysically continuous\nsequence does not imply that they are identical except in luminosity,\nsize and other\nscales, any more than to say O stars and M dwarfs belong to one\nphysically continuous\nmain sequence implies that they are identical except in luminosity, size\nand other\nscales. The luminosities of AGNs are very high; a nucleus with\nMB = -23 has, in\norder of magnitude, L\n1012L 1045.6erg\ns-1 integrated over the ultraviolet,\noptical and infrared spectral regions 0.1 \u00b5m\n100 \u00b5m\n(Edelson and Malkan\n1986),\nor L 5 x 1012L 2 x\n1046 erg s-1 integrated over the entire `observed' range\n(including interpolations and sketches below upper limits)\n1010 Hz 1025 Hz\n(Ramaty and\nLingenfelter 1982,\nUrry 1990).\nThis is released within a very small\nvolume, typically with a dimension of less than a few tens of light\ndays, as will be\ndiscussed quantitatively in the next section. The energy release is far\nlarger than\nthat which can be derived from stars we know, or any stellar-like\nobjects operating\non thermonuclear reactions. The only energy-release process that seems\npossible is\nthe liberation of gravitational energy. The one that seems most\nplausible by far is\nthe gravitational release of energy in a rotating accretion disk around\na massive black hole, as has been well reviewed by Rees\n(1977,\n1978,\n1984).\n\nNo matter what the energy-liberation process is, radiation pressure will\nbe important,\nand any spherically symmetric object which is stable must be gravitationally\nbound against being blown apart by it. This is the Eddington condition\n\nHere T is the\nelectron-scattering cross section, and the condition has been written\nfor a pure hydrogen, completely ionized object; any larger opacity would\ncorrespond to a\nsmaller limit on the luminosity. For an AGN with L 1046 erg\ns-1, this corresponds\nto M\n108M, the\nminimum mass for a spherically symmetric situation. In more\ncomplicated geometries, for instance a roughly cylindrically symmetric\nstructure, it is\nstill useful as an order of magnitude estimate. Furthermore, if enough\nfuel is available,\nthe luminosity tends to build up too close to this self-limiting maximum value.\nThe luminosity gives the rate at which mass is converted to energy\n\nin solar masses per year, with\nthe efficiency or fraction\nof the energy which escapes\ndisappearing into the black hole and is radiated. For\n0.1, probably a high estimate\nof the efficiency, 1.8\nM yr-1\nfor an AGN with L = 1046 erg s-1.\n\nAGNs radiate their energy over a wide range of energies, from\n-ray and x-rays\nthrough the ultraviolet, optical and infrared spectral regions to the\nfar-infrared and\nradio-frequency regions. This is the reason the luminosity quoted above\nis so much\nhigher integrated over the entire energy range. Thus observations at all\nfrequencies yield important information on the structure and nature of AGNs.\n\nBecause the AGNs are so small in angular scale as to be unresolved except for\nthe very outermost parts of a few of the very nearest examples, we can\nobserve only\nthe integrated radiation of the entire object. Thus interpreting the\nmeasured data\nto deduce the structure of the AGN is far from simple. Nebulae, nova shells and\nsupernova remnants are valuable `laboratories' from which spatially\nresolved information\nis available, to suggest and also to test physical ideas that may be\nimportant in understanding AGNs."}

HH 110 appears different from most other Herbig-Haro objects: in particular, it appears on its own while they usually come in pairs. Astronomers think it may be a continuation of another object called HH 270, after it has been deflected off a dense cloud of gas.

When the energetic and fast-moving Herbig-Haro jets slam into colder gas, they form shock fronts that look and behave much like the bow waves that form in front of a boat. These so-called bow shocks, which glow thanks to very high temperatures, are a distinctive feature of Herbig-Haro objects.\n\nThe structure of HH 110 and other objects like it acts like a ticker-tape, recording the activity of the star that is the origin of the jet. Erratic outbursts from the star happen at times when more matter is falling in, and these are recorded as brighter knots or blobs within the Herbig-Haro object, which move along the jet over the years. Although the jets are very fast-moving, they are also very large: the streamer of gas in this image is around half a light-year in length. This means that the motion appears quite slow from our vantage point, even when measured over years (see heic1113 - \n\nBy measuring the current speed and positions of blobs within a Herbig-Haro object, astronomers can rewind time, projecting the motion of the knots backwards to the moment when they were emitted. This in turn tells the scientists about the environment directly around the forming star"}

Its lifetime,\nlimited by exhaustion of the liquid helium which cooled telescope and detectors,\noutlasted the 18-month nominal mission and reached 28 months\n(finally warming up in May 1998).\nThe telescope on ISO was the same size as that of IRAS, at 60 cm diameter.\nThe major differences between the missions were that IRAS was\noptimized to survey the sky in a few broad passbands, while ISO\nwas designed to study known targets in great detail. It carried\ntwo cameras and two spectrometers, operating from 2-240 microns.\n\nWe used ISO data to examine the properties of dust in galaxies,\nusing overlapping glaaxies to simultaneously see the dust in\nemission in the infrared and in absorption in optical and near-IR light.\nComparison of the two let us test for any small clumps of dust that\nwouldn't be effective optical absorbers, or any widespread very\ncold dust that would absorb visible light but contribute minimally\nto the far-IR. As it happened, additional data with the\nJCMT at longer wavelengths were important in reaching our goal.\nHere are some 12-micron images of galaxy pairs from the ISOCAM\narray. Our longer-wavelength observations all look like unresolvd\ndots, so they're much less visually interesting.

For each picture, we show an optical image (from HST or CTIO)\nfor reference along with the 12-micron ISO image. This filter sees\nmostly the warmest dust in star-forming regions, so that elliptical\ngalaxies are very dim unless they have an active nucleus (as the\none in AM1318-432 does, being a powerful radio galaxy).\n\nLater, we obtained a long series of observations at 8 microns\ncovering the 53W002 group of galaxies at redshift z=2.4 (also described\nunder out HST and Kitt Peak\nobservations. This wavelength gives the radiation that started out in the\nwell-studied K band at 24 microns, and would be a sensitive indicator\nof the population of old, cooler stars in these objects.

{"text": "MySlate is a new tool that lets you track your favorite parts of Slate. You can follow authors and sections, track comment threads you're interested in, and more.\n\nI love it when a good observation backs up a hypothesis.\n\nOur galaxy is essentially made of three things: stars, gas, and dust (well, there's dark matter too, which actually dominates the mass of the galaxy, but we can't see it). By dust, I mean various molecules that absorb visible light, so they look black when seen in photos (see this gallery for several examples). Some are complex organic compounds (essentially, soot), while others are chemically pretty simple like iron silicate (FeSiO3).\n\nThere's a lot of dust in the galaxy, and we think it's made when stars are born, and when they die. Massive stars explode when they die, and dust can be made inside the expanding debris. This has been seen before, but a new observation removes all doubt that this occurs:\n\nHubble (left) and Herschel (right) images of the Crab Nebula, the expanding debris from a star that exploded a millenium ago. Click to crustaceanate.\n\nOn the left is a Hubble image of the Crab Nebula, the rapidly expanding material from a star that went supernova back in 1054 (or, if you prefer, the light reached us on that date). As you can see, it looks like an explosion! The filaments and fingers are extremely hot gas expanding at well over a thousand kilometers per second\u2014that's a thousand times faster than a rifle bullet. The Hubble image is in visible light, the kind we can see with our eyes (you can get just the Hubble image alone if you'd like, and I recommend getting the limulidaenated 3864 x 3864 pixel image).\n\nOn the right is the same view using the European Space Agency's Herschel observatory, a space telescope that sees way out into the infrared. In the past, telescopes in that wavelength have only gotten blurry, extremely low-resolution images of the Crab, but here you can actually trace many of the same structures in the Hubble image as in the one from Herschel. What looks red in the picture is dust at an incredibly chilly 28 Kelvins, about -245\u00b0 Celsius (-410\u00b0 F). Green and blue are slightly warmer, by just a few degrees.\n\nThe astronomers who took this observation very carefully removed the influence of various non-dust sources of light (including things like atoms of carbon and oxygen, and radiation from atoms whipping around the strong magnetic fields inside the nebula; they used several other infrared observatories like WISE, Planck, Spitzer, and ISO to do this), until all that was left was infrared light from the dust. When they did, they found that the total mass of dust in the Crab is about 0.25 times the mass of the Sun.\n\nA quarter of the Sun may not sound like much\u2026 but that means it's enough dust to make 80,000 Earths! Imagine, 80,000 planets like our own, lined up side-by-side\u2026they'd stretch for over a billion kilometers (600 million miles), more than the distance from the Sun to Jupiter! And that's just from dust. The total mass of all the expanding shrapnel from the supernova is nearly five times that of the Sun. And mind you, this all came from a single exploding star. Before it blew up, it was far more massive than our own star.\n\nWhile there was little doubt before, these new observations make it pretty clear at least some of the dust in the galaxy comes from exploded stars. Massive stars are rare, but the death of each one creates a lot of stuff. Still, the total amount made by supernovae is hard to determine. In most supernovae, expanding material slamming into the thin matter between the stars creates enormous shock waves that rip dust molecules apart. In the Crab, conditions are a little odd; there isn't much gas outside the expanding remnant, so the shock waves are weak, letting the dust survive.\n\nThat's a pretty typical kind of thing astronomers have to deal with. You come up with an idea, test it, and it works! Yay! But there's always some monkey in the wrench that makes life more complicated and more difficult. But the good news here is that the infrared observations certainly confirm that dust is made where stars die, and the high-resolution images even help astronomers understand how it happens.\n\nWe talk about the cycle of life on Earth, but it exists in the heavens as well. Stars are born, live out their existence, and then some explode. When they die, they scatter into the Universe the elements needed for planet formation and, eventually, for life to arise. As Carl Sagan was fond of saying, we are star stuff. It's literally true.\n\nPerhaps that statement resonates with you as strongly as it does in me; I sometimes get choked up thinking about it.

Featured were talks by Shapley and the aforementioned Heber Curtis, who were recognized as spokesmen for opposite views on the nature of spiral nebulae and the Milky Way Galaxy. This so-called debate has often been cited as an illustration of how revolutionary new concepts are assimilated by science. It is sometimes compared to the debate, centuries before, over the motions of the Earth (the Copernican revolution); however, though as a focal point the debate about Earth's motion can be used to define the modern controversy, the Shapley-Curtis debate actually was much more complicated.\n\nA careful reading of the documents involved suggests that, on the broader topic of the scale of the universe, both men were making incorrect conclusions but for the same reasons\u2014namely, for being unable to accept and comprehend the incredibly large scale of things. Shapley correctly argued for an enormous Milky Way Galaxy on the basis of the P-L relation and the globular clusters, while Curtis incorrectly rejected these lines of evidence, advocating instead a small galactic system. Given a Milky Way Galaxy system of limited scale, Curtis could argue for and consider plausible the extragalactic nature of the spiral nebulae. Shapley, on the other hand, incorrectly rejected the island universe theory of the spirals (i.e., the hypothesis that there existed comparable galaxies beyond the boundaries of the Milky Way Galaxy) because he felt that such objects would surely be engulfed by the local galactic system. Furthermore, he put aside the apparent faint novae in M31, preferring to interpret S Andromeda as an ordinary nova, for otherwise that object would have been unbelievably luminous. Unfortunately for him, such phenomena\u2014called supernovae\u2014do in fact exist, as was realized a few years later. Curtis was willing to concede that there might be two classes of novae, yet, because he considered the Milky Way Galaxy to be small, he underestimated their differences. The van Maanen rotation also entered into Shapley's arguments: if spiral nebulae were rotating so fast, they must be within the Milky Way Galaxy as he conceived it. For Curtis, however, the matter provided less of a problem: even if spiral nebulae did rotate as rapidly as claimed, the small scale of Curtis's universe allowed them to have physically reasonable speeds.\n\nThe Shapley-Curtis debate took place near the end of the era of the single-galaxy universe. In just a few years the scientific world became convinced that Shapley's grand scale of the Milky Way Galaxy was correct and at the same time that Curtis was right about the nature of spiral nebulae. Such objects indeed lie even outside Shapley's enormous Milky Way Galaxy, and they range far beyond the distances that in 1920 seemed too vast for many astronomers to comprehend"}

{"text": "Disruption of giant molecular clouds by massive star clusters\n\nJun 02, 2011 past, these new results show how, even before a single star explodes as a supernova, massive stars carve out huge bubbles and limit the star formation rates in galaxies.\n\nThe findings are being presented by Dr. Elizabeth Harper-Clark and Prof. Norman Murray of the Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics (CITA) at the 2011 meeting of the Canadian Astronomical Society (CASCA) in London, ON, Canada.\n\nGalaxies are the birthplace of stars. As the stellar population changes, so the galaxy evolves. Yet, the stately pace of this evolution remains unexplained. It is generally believed that the pace of star formation is regulated by the outflow of energy from other stars and possibly black holes.\n\nThe lifetime of a Giant Molecular Cloud (GMC, a large star-forming nebula) and the total mass of stars that form within it are crucial to the understanding of star formation rates across a galaxy. In particular, the stars within a GMC can disrupt their host and consequently quench further star formation. Indeed, observations show that our own galaxy, the Milky Way, contains GMCs with extensive expanding bubbles but without supernova remnants, indicating that the GMCs are being disrupted before any supernovae occur.\n\nRadiation from stars interacts with the gas in the surrounding GMC in two main ways: ionization and radiation pressure. Ionization works by forcibly ejecting electrons from atoms at high speed; these electrons then heat up the gas, increasing the gas pressure. Radiation pressure is more subtle and often ignored -- the momentum from the light is transferred to the gas atoms when light is absorbed. These momentum transfers add up, always pushing away from the light source, and produce the most significant effect, according to these simulations.\n\nThe simulations performed by Harper-Clark represent the first calculations of the effects of radiation pressure on GMCs and show that this pressure is capable of disrupting such clouds, the main star-forming units in galaxies. \"The results suggest that the slow rate of star formation seen in galaxies across the universe may be the result of radiative feedback from massive stars,\" says Professor Murray, Director of CITA.\n\nSimulating entire GMCs is challenging, due to the large variety of physics that needs to be included and the computational power required to accurately simulate a GMC over tens of millions of years. Using the radiative-magneto-hydrodynamic code Enzo, Harper-Clark ran multiple simulations of GMCs under different conditions.\n\nHarper-Clark robustly found that with only the light emitted by the stars (radiation) during their lifetimes the GMC could be completely blown apart, cutting off star formation after a percentage between 5% and 20% of the original cloud's mass had been converted into stars.\n\nInterestingly, when supernovae were included in the simulations they were found to be unimportant. Both with and without the light from stars, supernovae were not significant on the disruption of the GMC, nor did they alter the subsequent star formation. With no radiation feedback, supernovae exploded in a dense region leading to rapid cooling. This robbed the supernovae of their most effective form of feedback, hot gas pressure. When radiative feedback is included, the supernovae explode into an already evacuated (and leaky) bubble, allowing the hot gas to expand rapidly and leak away without affecting the remaining dense GMC gas. \"These simulations suggest that it is the light from stars that carves out nebulae, rather than the explosions at the end of their lives,\" says Dr. Harper-Clark.\n\nFound in the nearby Large Magellanic Cloud, 30 Doradus is one of the largest massive star forming regions close to the Milky Way. Enormous stars in 30 Doradus, also known as the Tarantula Nebula, are producing ...\n\nAstronomers have long known that young or \"open\" star clusters must eventually disrupt and dissolve into the host galaxy.

Thanks to new observations from Dutch ...\n\n(PhysOrg.com) -- Theorists have long wondered how massive stars--up to 120 times the mass of the Sun--can form without blowing away the clouds of gas and dust that feed their growth. But the problem turnslight from massive stars is, by itself, enough to blow apart the nebula\n\nAlthough this is only \"a computer simulation\", it may explain how a glowing ball of waste products (photosphere) can accumulate and be suspended above neutron stars to produce ordinary-looking stars like the Sun.\n\nWhat are galaxies if not a collection of a whole lot of stars? Where does the first stars come from? Are they implying that galaxies appear suddenly in one massive POP, spewing out stars at prodigious rates, before the birth of stars and supernovas can disrupt any further star formation by blowing the gas away? So then they don't really know where stars come from and hence by implication where galaxies come from. This means that the current theories of cosmology and cosmogony are really a lot of hot air as far as explanatory power is concerned. If you cannot explain where stars and galaxies come from or how they are created, you cannot explain anything else. But of course it doesn't mean they should stop trying, just stop pretending they know it all.\n\n@kevinrtrs The article clearly states that 5% to 20% of the GMC mass is converted into stars before the GMC is crippled by radiation. The remaining gass does not dissappear, some of it may condense into new clouds at later stages unless it is blown entirely out of the galaxy by some extreme star burst formation or perhaps an active galactic nucleus.\n\nAlthough this is only \"a computer simulation\", it may explain how a glowing ball of waste products (photosphere) can accumulate and be suspended above neutron stars to produce ordinary-looking stars like the Sun.\n\nCan't happen since there is no neutron star in the Sun. Now the churning idea is reasonable BUT since the heat reaching the surface of the Sun come from reactions that took place a million years ago, according to theory that actually follows known physics, it seems that there might be a bit of lag between the churning and the heat released from the photosphere.\n\nwaste products (H/He-rich photosphere\n\nShe didn't say that despite you spamming her.

Astronomers combined light from Spitzer's IRAC and MIPS cameras in this mosaic. (Photo: NASA/JPL/SSC)\n\nAstronomers using NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope have given the world a spectacular new picture of a star-forming region called the \"Christmas Tree Cluster,\" complete with first-ever views of a group of newborn stars still linked to their siblings.\n\nSpitzer's cameras are very sensitive to the infrared (heat), allowing astronomers to see through the obscuring gas and dust of the star-forming cloud that swaddles infant stars.\n\nThe Christmas Tree Cluster, also known as NGC 2264, is a well-studied region in the Monoceros (the Unicorn) constellation. The Christmas Tree Cluster was so named because it looks like a tree in visible light. The nebula is roughly 2,500 light-years away. That is, the nebula emitted the light in the new Spitzer image 2,500 years ago.\n\nFor astronomers studying the development of very young stars -- stars less than a few million years old -- \"This region has it all,\" said University of Arizona astronomer Erick T. Young.\n\n\"We see the dramatic-looking emission of cold gas -- clouds that look like thunderheads. We see when the massive molecular cloud breaks up and begins to condense into clumps of stars,\" Young said. \"And, for the first time, because of Spitzer's sensitivity, we can see individual stars roughly the size of our sun tightly packed within those clumps.\" The cluster of stars is so tightly packed that they must be less than 100,000 years old, he added.\n\nAstronomers are calling this compact collection of bright protostars within the Christmas Tree Cluster the \"Snowflake Cluster\" because of how they are spaced. The newborn stars are patterned like a single feathery crystal of snow, or geometrically spaced like spokes in a wheel.\n\nThe Spitzer observations show that just as theory predicts, the density and temperature of the initial star-forming cloud dictates the spacing between the protostars.\n\nYoung is deputy principal investigator for Spitzer's Multiband Imaging Photometer (MIPS), a UA-built camera that took the longest wavelengths of infrared light used in Christmas Tree Cluster mosaic.

{"text": "Friday, November 05, 2010 Cosmic Radio Beacons Because all cosmic objects evolve with time, astronomers sometimes have a difficult time deciding if two sources that seem different are actually related but just in different stages of life. A case in point: galaxies that emit strong radio emission. Since they were first studied over fifty years ago, it has been known that, broadly speaking, they tend to fall into two groups distinguished by their radio luminosities, either modest or very bright. The problems are in deciding whether they are intrinsically similar, but observed with differences due to their ages or perhaps to our viewing angle (since they are disk-shaped, obscuring material in the plane can block emission), and how they might be related to other, more famous, optically luminous galaxies like quasars.\n\nCfA astronomer Aneta Siemiginowska teamed with three colleagues to analyze a new sample of forty-four radio galaxies, selected from recent radio surveys, whose luminosity and other characteristics make them appear part of a uniform class of low luminosity radio sources. The sizes of the radio sources are all smaller than that of the host galaxy. By correlating the physical sizes with their luminosities, and by building on previous studies of classical radio galaxies, the astronomers find that as a group the new sources are faint for their sizes, and they argue this indicate that the emission is short-lived, and is the result of a interim period of activity.\n\nThe scientists argue that active events like these are characteristic of an early stage in the evolution of radio galaxies as they fragment -- but the reasons for fragmentation are still not clear. The fragments in turn, they suggest, evolve into the classical bright group of radio sources. The reasons this happens is still unclear, but the new work provides a large, homogeneous new sample of objects to probe the early stages in the development of these cosmic radio beacons. The relatively large sample size makes it possible to reach credible general conclusions even though the character of any one of the new radio sources might be ambiguous."}
{"text": "New Comets, Asteroids Discovered by NASA (PHOTOS)\n\nZeta Ophiuchi -- Runaway Star Plowing Through Space Dust\n\nThe blue star near the center of this image is Zeta Ophiuchi. Zeta Ophiuchi is actually a very massive, hot, bright blue star plowing its way through a large cloud of interstellar dust and gas.\nAstronomers theorize that this stellar juggernaut was likely once part of a binary star system with an even more massive partner. It's believed that when the partner exploded as a supernova, blasting away most of its mass, Zeta Ophiuchi was suddenly freed from its partner's pull and shot away like a bullet moving 24 kilometers per second (54,000 miles per hour).\nZeta Ophiuchi is about 20 times more massive and 65,000 times more luminous than the sun. If it weren't surrounded by so much dust, it would be one of the brightest stars in the sky and appear blue to the eye. It's already about halfway through its very short 8-million-year lifespan. In comparison, the sun is roughly halfway through its 10-billion-year lifespan. While the sun will eventually become a quiet white dwarf, Zeta Ophiuchi, like its ex-partner, will ultimately die in a massive explosion called a supernova.\nThe most interesting features in this image are related to the interstellar gas and dust that surrounds Zeta Ophiuchi. Another interesting feature is the bright yellow curved thing directly above Zeta Ophiuchi.\n\nPhoto: NASA\n\nDancing Galaxies\n\nThis image features two stunning galaxies engaged in an intergalactic dance. The galaxies, Messier 81 and Messier 82, swept by each other a few hundred million years ago, and will likely continue to twirl around each other multiple times before eventually merging into a single galaxy. The relatively recent encounter triggered a spectacular burst of star formation visible in both galaxies.\nMessier 81 (bottom of image) is a prototypical \"grand design\" spiral galaxy with its pronounced and well-defined arms spiraling into its core. Messier 82 (top of image) is also a spiral galaxy. However, it is seen edge-on from our point of view.\nA third, smaller galaxy, NGC 3077, can be seen at lower left. This spiral galaxy belongs to the same group as Messier 81 and Messier 82 -- a group that includes at least a dozen gravitationally linked galaxies. NGC 3077 is also experiencing a burst of new star birth, likely triggered by its interaction with Messier 81.\n\nPhoto: NASA\n\nGalaxy For Everyone\n\nNASA's Wide-Field Infrared Explorer, or WISE, the mission team has put together this image showing just a sample of the millions of galaxies that have been imaged by WISE during its survey of the entire sky.\nNGC 300 is seen in the image in the upper left panel. This is a textbook spiral galaxy. At about 39,000 light-years across, NGC 300 is only about 40 percent the size of the Milky Way galaxy.\nThe upper right image shows Messier 104, or M104, also known as the Sombrero galaxy. Although M104 is also classified as a spiral galaxy, it has a very different appearance than NGC 300. In part, this is because the dusty, star-forming spiral disk in M104 is seen nearly edge-on from our point of view. M104 also has a large, ball-shaped bulge component of older stars, seen here in blue.\nThe large, fuzzy grouping of stars at the center of the lower left panel is the galaxy Messier 60, or M60. This galaxy does not have a spiral disk, just a bulge, making it a massive elliptical galaxy. M60 is about 20 percent larger than the Milky Way galaxy, and lies in the Virgo cluster of galaxies. The brighter dense spot inside but off-center from the blue core of M60 is a separate spiral galaxy called NGC 4647.\nRecent evidence suggests there is a black hole at the center of M60 with a mass of about 4.5 billion times that of the sun, making it one of the largest black holes known.\nThe galaxy in the lower right panel is Messier 51, or NGC 5194, also frequently referred to as the Whirlpool galaxy. The Whirlpool is a \"grand design\" spiral galaxy. It is interacting with its smaller companion -- NGC 5195, a dwarf galaxy, which can be seen as a bright spot near the tip of the spiral arm extending up and to the right of the larger galaxy. The Whirpool's very bright spiral arms show areas of compressed dust and gas.\n\nPhoto: NASA\n\nExplosion of Infrared Light\n\nA circular rainbow appears like a halo around an exploded star in this new view of the IC 443 nebula from NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, or WISE.\nWhen massive stars die, they explode in tremendous blasts, called supernova, which send out shock waves. The shock waves sweep up and heat surrounding gas and dust, creating supernova remnants like the one pictured here. The supernova in IC 443 happened somewhere between 5,000 and 10,000 years ago.\nIn this WISE image, infrared light has been color-coded to reveal what our eyes cannot see. The colors differ primarily because materials surrounding the supernova remnant vary in density. When the shock waves hit these materials, different gases were triggered to release a mix of infrared wavelengths.\nIC 443 can be found near the star Eta Geminorum, which lies near Castor, one of the twins in the constellation Gemini.\n\nPhoto: NASA\n\nLagoon Nebula\n\nThis colorful picture is a mosaic of the Lagoon nebula taken by NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, or WISE. Normally, you would expect a lagoon to be filled with water, but this nebula is composed of clouds of gas and dust in which new stars are forming.\nAlso known as Messier 8, or simply M8, the Lagoon nebula is seen here as a large circular cloud in the center of the image, surrounded by innumerable stars.\nLagoon nebula can be found in constellation Sagittarius. Distance measurements to this nebula vary widely, from 4,000 to 6,500 light-years away from Earth. At the center of the Lagoon nebula is the star Herschel 36.\nM8 is a favorite target for amateur astronomers because it can be easily seen with binoculars or a small telescope. Astronomers have identified several different parts of the Lagoon nebula, including M8E, a young stellar object, and the star clusters NGC 6523 and NGC 6530.\n\nPhoto: NASA\n\nNeighbor Galaxy\n\nThis image shows of one of our closest neighboring galaxies, Messier 33. Also named the Triangulum galaxy (after the constellation it's found in), M33 is one of largest members in our small neighborhood of galaxies -- the Local Group.\nThe Local Group consists of about 30 galaxies that are gravitationally bound and travel together through the universe. M33 is the third largest member of the Local Group, dwarfed only by the Andromeda galaxy (M31) and our very own home galaxy, the Milky Way.\nM33 is extremely close as far as galaxies go, residing only 3 million light-years away. Star-forming regions are easy to spot in infrared (green and red areas in this image).\nThe bright yellow-orange 'blobs' scattered throughout M33 are areas where stars are forming at an especially intense rate. The largest one in the spiral arm to the upper left has its own name, NGC 604.\n\nPhoto: NASA\n\nChasing Chickens in Lambda Centauri Nebula\n\nThis infrared image from WISE shows the Lambda Centauri nebula, a star-forming cloud in our Milky Way galaxy, also known as the Running Chicken nebula. The nebula, cataloged as IC 2944, is about 5,800 light-years from Earth and is home to a new cluster of stars born from the cloud nearly 8 million years ago.\nThe hottest members of the cluster produce enough ultraviolet radiation and strong winds to convert the cloud into ions and excavate it. The ionized gas glows in visible light, but in infrared light we see the dust in the cloud warmed by the very same radiation. The red, glowing dust is the coolest material visible in this image and is composed of metallic dust grains.\nThe greenish components in the image are warmer dust grains composed of smog-like materials. The large green ring-like structure near the middle of the image is some 77 light-years across and was formed when materials that created the stars in the clusters were blown back by the combined winds of the stars.\nThe nebula gets its common name because in some visible light images it resembles a running chicken. It is also called the Lambda Centauri nebula because it appears to surround the bright star Lambda Centauri. Lambda Centauri is one of the brightest stars in the constellation Centaurus.\n\nPhoto: NASA\n\nCosmic Cocoon\n\nThe aptly named Cocoon nebula is featured in this image from NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, or WISE. This cloud of dust and gas, cataloged as IC 5416 and located in the constellation Cygnus, is wrapped in a dark cloud of dust called Barnard 168. Within this cocoon of dust and gas, new stars are forming and beginning to emerge into the wild.\nIn the heart of the nebula, which looks surprisingly like a Valentine's heart in WISE's view, massive new stars are emerging. The intense radiation from these stars heats up the cloud. The highest-energy light from the stars rips electrons from hydrogen atoms, which then recombine with the atoms and emit visible light.\nThe dusty cocoon extends over 45 light-years across, which is more than three times larger than the inner, glowing portion of the nebula.\n\nPhoto: NASA\n\nThe Dark Heart of the King\n\nWISE captured this image of a hidden star-forming cloud of dust and gas located in the constellation of Cepheus. Cepheus, father of Andromeda, was a mythological king in the ancient Greek world. This image of dark nebulae lies near the heart of the king, as imagined by ancient Greek astronomers.\nThe dust in these nebulae blocks visible light passing through, and the cloud and its contents are mostly hidden when viewed in visible light.\nThe central portion is known as IRAS 22298+6505. IRAS stands for Infrared Astronomical Satellite, a predecessor to WISE and an international satellite that mapped the sky in infrared light in the 1980s. Other portions of this cloud are called TGU H686 P2 and LDN 1213. As with IRAS, the first letters of these objects refer to astronomical catalogs.\nWhat looked like distinct nebulae in those surveys are revealed as a much larger cloud complex by WISE. This complex spans about 120 light-years across and is located about 2,500 light-years away at the edge of a spiral arm of the Milky Way galaxy, called the Orion spur.\n\nPhoto: NASA\n\nA Spiral Galaxy is Visited by a Trojan War Hero\n\nIt's a bird! It's a plane! Nope, it's an asteroid tracking its way across the sky with a beautiful spiral galaxy in the background. In the center of this new mosaic image captured by NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) is the galaxy Messier 74, with its spiral arms seen face-on.\nThe bright reddish object moving across the lower right part of the image is the much closer asteroid 3540 Protesilaos, seen at different points in its orbit around the sun.\nAlso known as NGC 628, the Messier 74 galaxy is between 24.5 and 36 million light-years away, and has a diameter of about 100,000 light-years. It is suspected to have a black hole at its center, with a mass equal to 10,000 suns.\nBy convention, Trojan asteroids are named after the heroes from the Trojan War. In this case, asteroid 3540 is named after the hero Protesilaos.\nAccording to Greek mythology, Protesilaos was the first Greek to set foot on Trojan land during the war. Unfortunately for him, there was a prophecy that the first soldier in the war to step onto land from a battle ship would die. The prophecy quickly came true and Protesilaos was killed."}
{"text": "Explanation: The Virgo Cluster of Galaxies is the closest cluster of galaxies to our Milky Way Galaxy. The Virgo Cluster is so close that it spans more than 5 degrees on the sky - about 10 times the angle made by a full Moon. With its heart lying about 70 million light years distant, the Virgo Cluster is the nearest cluster of galaxies, contains over 2,000 galaxies, and has a noticeable gravitational pull on the galaxies of the Local Group of Galaxies surrounding our Milky Way Galaxy. The cluster contains not only galaxies filled with stars but also gas so hot it glows in X-rays. Motions of galaxies in and around clusters indicate that they contain more dark matter than any visible matter we can see. Pictured above, the heart of the Virgo Cluster includes bright Messier galaxies such as Markarian's Eyes on the upper left, M86 just to the upper right of center, M84 on the far right, as well as spiral galaxy NGC 4388 at the bottom right.\n\nQuelle \n\nThe Virgo Cluster is extremely rich in member galaxies, with over 2000 large and small members. While most of them are very small and can only be detected with huge telescopes, there is still a very large number of promising targets for amateur astronomers, even with small telescopes, starting at 2 or 3 inch, or even binoculars; this fact is suggested already by the fact that Messier's catalog list 16 Virgo cluster members:Because of the huge gravity caused by the galaxy cluster's enormous mass, some of the Virgo Cluster members have been accelerated to high peculiar velocities, with respect to the cluster's center of mass, at least up to 1,600 km/sec. As the cluster is receding from us at only 1,100 km/sec, some of its members are moving toward us at considerably high blueshift rates, the highest measured for any extragalactic objects. Others happen to move into the direction away from us, and are thus receding at more than souble the velocity as the cluster. In the following, a list is given of extreme peculiar motions of Virgo Cluster member galaxies (from the Sky Catalog 2000); we give the radial velocity with respect to our Milky Way's Galactic Center"}
{"text": "Abstract:\n\nA simple scenario of cosmological reionization is presented. In hierarchical clustering models of structure formation, numerous nonlinear objects on small scales would collapse much earlier than a redshift z \u223c10. Our scenario assumes that such objects dissipate their kinetic energy efficiently into heat and eventually provide copious ionizing photons which reionize the universe almost instantaneously. We derive a simple estimate of the energy conversion efficiency required for the full reionization. Then we apply the formula to a specific hierarchical clustering model in which the power spectrum of density fluctuation obeys a single power-law P(k) \u221dkn approximately on scales of interest (at standard recombination epoch). After comparing the resulting production rate of ionizing photons with cooling rates of the relevant processes, we find that models with the spectral index n \u2265-1 can potentially reionize the universe at z \u226510. For flatter spectra, the universe remains effectively neutral. This index is somewhat larger than the conventional value around -2 on galactic scales in a cold dark matter universe, but is preferred phenomenologically in primordial isocurvature baryon models, for instance. Therefore it is possible to achieve a reionization of the universe naturally due to the energy release associated with the structure formation. We discuss briefly the implications of our scenario, in particular on the anisotropies and distortion of the cosmic microwave background, and on a characteristic mass of galaxies."}

{"text": "Galaxies have one job to do: Turn gas into stars. Dwarf galaxies\nare really bad at their jobs. Take Ursa Minor, for example.\nIt contains about half a million stars. However, in the past it\nprobably contained much more mass in gas than its present mass in\nstars. That's because it lost a great deal of gas over its\nlifetime.\n\nGalaxies lose gas in a variety of ways. The most common ways for\ndwarf galaxies to lose gas is \"stellar feedback\" and \"tidal\nstripping.\" Stellar feedback is the loss of gas from the galaxy\ndue to energy input from the stars. For example, when some stars\nend their lives, they blow up as supernovae. One supernova puts\nout as much energy in one second as the the Sun does in several billion\nyears! That much energy can expel a lot of gas from the\ngalaxy.\n\nTidal stripping is a mechanism of gas loss unique to\ndwarf galaxies, which are satellites of larger galaxies. When the\ndwarf galaxy gets close enough to its large host, the much stronger\ngravity of the larger galaxy can rip gas out of the smaller\ngalaxy. In the case of Ursa Minor and the other galaxies\nrepresented in the plot to the left, that large host galaxy is our\nGalaxy, the Milky Way.\n\nMassive stars are nuclear reactors, fusing hydrogen and helium into heavier\nelements like iron. To illustrate how much material is lost from\ngalaxies, let's again consider Ursa Minor. Over its lifetime,\nUrsa Minor synthesized a couple thousand times the Sun's mass in\niron. That number is represent by the hollow circled labeled\n\"UMi.\" My measurements show that Ursa Minor presently contains\nless than a thousand solar masses of iron. That's the filled\nblack circle. That means the puny galaxy lost 99.8% of the iron\nthat its stars produced. That's like getting a 0.2% on your\nperformance review.\n\nMore massive galaxies lost a slightly smaller percentage of their\niron. Fornax, which is about 35 times the mass of Ursa Minor,\nlost 96% of the iron that its stars produced. And it's not just\niron. The metals lost from the galaxy also include magnesium,\nsilicon, and calcium. Even a galaxy like NGC 1569, which is even\nmore massive than Fornax, lost nearly all of the metals that its stars\nproduced. That means that only the largest galaxies in the\nUniverse, like our Milky Way, do a good job of turning their gas into\nstars.\n\nSay\nhello to the newest member of the Local Group of galaxies, VV124.\nThe Local Group is a collection of mostly dwarf galaxies, but it also\nincludes big ones like the Milky Way and Andromeda. Until a few\nyears ago, a big catalog mistakenly listed VV124 as being about 10\ntimes more distant than it actually is. When the mistake was\nnoticed, the true distance confirmed VV124 as a member of the Local\nGroup.\n\nMy faculty contact at Caltech, Judy Cohen, and the Italian astronomer\nMichele Bellazzini, had the idea to look at VV124 with the Keck II\ntelescope. Judy and I observed this galaxy in January 2011 with\nthe amazing spectrograph called DEIMOS. We spent an entire night\nstaring at this galaxy, and our reward was beautiful stellar\nspectra. These spectra contain information about the individual\nstars that make up VV124. The information we're interested in\nincludes the velocities of the stars and their compositions.\n\nThe top panel of the figure to the left shows the distribution of iron\namong the stars of VV124. A pretty basic model of galactic\nchemical evolution describes this distribution pretty well. The\nblue line (overlapping exactly with the red line) is that simple\nmodel. Adding complexity to the model\ngives a slightly better description of the iron\ndistribution. The red and green lines represent more complex\nmodels, and the green line fits the data a little better than the blue\nline.\nTherefore, VV124 is a simple galaxy that started with pure\nhydrogen gas, and it turned some of that gas into stars. It may\nhave acquired a small amount of gas while it was forming stars.\n\nThe velocity distribution of the stars presents additional evidence\nthat VV124 is a simple galaxy. The velocities are distributed\naccording to a \"Gaussian,\" a bell curve. What's more is that the\nstars on one side of the galaxy don't show any different average\nvelocity than the stars on the other side of the galaxy. That\nmeans that the galaxy does not rotate. The stars move around\nrandomly without any ordered motion. That's typical of dwarf\ngalaxies.\n\nThe strange thing is that the gas\nin the galaxy does have velocity structure. Why the gas is ordered but the stars are not\nremains a mystery.\n\nLithium is a fairly simple element. It has just three protons,\none more than helium and two more than hydrogen. The Big Bang\nmanufactured\nnearly all of the lithium in the Universe. From there, the\nlithium content of the Universe has decreased because stars destroy lithium in the\ncourse of normal setllar evolution. In the plot to the left, the\ngray points show the amount of lithium in stars at different points in\ntheir lives. Stellar evolution moves stars to the right on this\ndiagram. At a certain point, when the star transitions from being\na dwarf star to a giant star, over 90% of the lithium is converted into\nhelium. Another episode of lithium destruction takes care of the\nrest of the lithium.\n\nAlmost all stars obey this simple picture. However, a few giant\nstars are renegades. A very small number of red giant\nstars--about 1%--have a lot lithium. Some of them have even\nmore lithium than they started with. That means that these stars\ndidn't just save their lithium from destruction. They created it.\n\nA master's student (Xiaoting Fu) and I found 14 red giants in dwarf galaxies that belong to this special\nclass of giants. I don't know how these stars get all that\nlithium, but I'm not alone. Some smart theorists have some good\nideas, but none of them is completely consistent with the data.\nRegardless, this new sample of 14 metal-poor, lithium-rich giants is\nlarger than all of the previous samples combined, and it will help\nthose theorists figure out what exactly is making all that lithium.\n\nThe\nmeasurement of alpha element abundances can reveal the history of star\nformation in a galaxy. I previously\nmeasured the alpha element distribution in the dwarf galaxy\nSculptor. Now I have devised a very basic model of chemical\nevolution to describe those measurements. The model is very\nsimple compared to some great models in the literature. However,\nI kept it simple intentionally so that it wouldn't take very long to\nrun on my computer. That way, I could quickly see the results of\nchanging the input parameters. That was important because I\nwanted to make a model that described my alpha element measurements as\nbest I could, so I had to try a lot of different input parameters.\n\nThe figure to the left illustrates the history of star formation and\ngas flow in Sculptor. This figure is one way to interpret the\nelemental distributions that I measured.\n\nThe top panel shows how Sculptor accumulated gas over the one billion\nyears that it formed stars. This information comes mostly from\nthe number of stars at different metallicites. That is, the\ninfall rate depends mostly on the [Fe/H] distribution, not [\u03b1/Fe].\n\nThe second panel shows the mass of Sculptor, separated into gas (blue)\nand stars (red). The peak gas mass is about ten times the final\nstellar mass. That means that Sculptor required a great deal of\ngas to catalyze the star formation of a relatively small mass of\nstars. The post above\ntalks about\ngalaxies having one job to do: Turn gas into stars. Sculptor was\nso bad at it that it had to go through tons and tons of gas to make\njust a few stars.\n\nThe third panel shows how fast Sculptor turned gas into stars.\nThis is another way to see that Sculptor was terrible at its job.\nAt its peak, its star formation rate was 0.026 solar masses per\nyear. For comparison, the star formation rate of the Milky Way is\nabout one solar mass per year.\n\nThe bottom two panels show the composition of the gas in Sculptor as a\nfunction of time. The steady decline of [Mg/Fe] with time\nindicates that Type Ia supernovae dominated the chemical evolution of\nSculptor. Those supernovae are big iron bombs that add a bunch of\niron (Fe) but no magnesium (Mg). As a result,those supernovae\nrapidly decrease [Mg/Fe].\n\nThis model isn't the only way to interpret the measured chemical\nabundances of Sculptor, but this model does roughly describe the\nobservations. In total, Sculptor formed stars for just one\nbillion years. That actually isn't that much. Consider that\nthe Earth has been around for over four billion years. The history\nof star formation in Sculptor is much shorter than Earth's geological\nhistory.\n\nThe\ndistribution of\ndifferent elements across the stars in a galaxy reveals the history of\nstar formation in the galaxy. The next\nsection explains the basic idea as it applies to one specific dwarf\ngalaxy. It is also enlightening to compare different dwarf\ngalaxies to each other. In particular, the trends in the\nelement abundance distributions may change with dwarf galaxy\nsize. In this case, \"size\" actually refers to the number of stars\nin the galaxy, which can equivalently be thought of as luminosity, or\nhow brightly the galaxy shines as a whole.\n\nThe legend in the plot on the left lists eight dwarf galaxies,\nsatellites\nof the Milky Way, in order from brightest (most stars) to faintest\n(fewest stars). As a point of reference, it also shows the trend\nin our own Milky Way galaxy, which is many times larger than the eight\ngalaxies I have included in my own study. It is clear that the\n[\u03b1/Fe] ratio drops more steeply with increasing [Fe/H] in the dwarf\ngalaxies than in the Milky Way. However, at low metallicity\n([Fe/H] < -1.5) [\u03b1/Fe] drops at about the same rate in the dwarf\ngalaxies, regardless of their final sizes.\n\nOne interpretation of the similarity in [\u03b1/Fe] at low [Fe/H] is\nthat the very first episodes of star formation in dwarf galaxies are\ninefficient. The galaxies' initially meager supplies of\ninterstellar gas, from which stars are formed, keep star formation at a\nlow level. As a result, the long-lived Type Ia supernovae have\nenough time to explode and depress the [\u03b1/Fe] ratio as the galaxies\nevolve and become enriched in iron (moving right along the x-axis).\n\nThat all of these galaxies show similar [\u03b1/Fe] at a given [Fe/H] is\nunexpected. Larger dwarf galaxies, like Fornax (dark red), are expected to have\nmore intense star formation than smaller dwarf galaxies, like Ursa\nMinor (dark blue).\nAs a result, the larger galaxies should have been able to keep their\n[\u03b1/Fe] high for a broader range of [Fe/H]. In fact, the average\nstar formation efficiency over the entire\ngalaxy lifetimes is certainly larger for the larger galaxies.\nHowever, the decline in [\u03b1/Fe] is manifest only for [Fe/H] < -1.5,\ncorresponding to the earliest epochs. Therefore, this plot shows\nthat the early star formation\nhistories of all eight galaxies was similar. At later times,\ncorresponding to [Fe/H] > -1.5, other methods of determining star\nformation histories show that the evolutionary paths of the galaxies\ndiverge.\n\nIn the process of\nstar formation, some stars explode as supernovae, releasing newly\ncreated elements into the interstellar gas. New stars form from\nthis gas, and the composition of those new stars incorporates the newly\ncreated elements. Some of the supernovae explode very quickly\nafter star formation begins. These are called Type II supernove,\nand they show a predictable pattern of elements. In particular,\nthe ratio of light \"alpha\" elements, like magnesium (Mg) and silicon\n(Si), to iron (Fe) in the ejecta is high. Other supernovae\nexplode only after a long time, perhaps as long as several billion\nyears. These are Type Ia supernovae, and the alpha-to-iron ratio\nin their ejecta is low. The difference in time to explosion means\nthat the timescale over which stars formed in the gaalxy is imprinted\nin the [\u03b1/Fe] ratio of the surviving stars in these galaxies.\n\nThis plot shows the [\u03b1/Fe] ratio for several hundred stars in the\nSculptor dwarf galaxy, a satellite of the Milky Way. The x-axis is the \"metallicity\" of the\nstar. You can think of metallicity as a proxy for the birth order\nof the star. Older stars have lower metallicity, or [Fe/H],\nwhereas younger stars have higher [Fe/H]. The y-axis, [\u03b1/Fe], is also a time\nindicator, but it is not strictly age. Rather, it indicates the\nfrequency of star formation. Galaxies that form stars quickly\nramp up [Fe/H] fast enough that Type Ia supernovae do not have time to\nexplode. As a result, [\u03b1/Fe] remains high over the full range of\n[Fe/H]. Galaxies that form stars at a leisurely pace over\nbillions of years have time for Type Ia supernovae to dilute the [\u03b1/Fe]\nratio.\n\nIn the case of Sculptor, a steady decline in [\u03b1/Fe] as a function of\n[Fe/H] means that the galaxy took its time in forming stars, at least a\nbillion years. The star formation age of Sculptor is important\nbecause dwarf galaxies like Sculptor are thought form part of our own\nMilky Way galaxy. In theory, dwarf galaxies are disrupted by the\nMilky Way and form a diffuse halo of stars around it. However,\nthe [\u03b1/Fe] patterns of Milky Way halo stars indicates that they formed\nvery quickly. Therefore, Sculptor is not representative of the\ngalaxies that may have built up the majority of the Milky Way\nhalo. However, galaxies like Sculptor may have a significant,\nongoing role in the continuing creation of the outer parts of the Milky\nWay halo.\n\nThis plot has been made possible by the techniques\nof my Ph.D. dissertation.\nSpecifically, I measured [Fe/H] and\n[\u03b1/Fe] from medium-resolution spectra obtained with the DEIMOS\ninstrument on the Keck II telescope. This plot has\nhelped to determine a more precise history of star formation in\nSculptor in a paper that I recently submitted to the Astrophysical\nJournal. The distribution of element abundances has helped us\nlearn how many stars formed in Sculptor at different\nhistorical epochs.\n\nA diffuse halo of stars and dark\nmatter surrounds the Milky Way. Most astronomers believe that\nsome of the oldest stars in the Universe\u2014nearly as old as the\nUniverse\nitself\u2014inhabit the stellar halo. Part of the reason to\nexpect these stars are so old is that they contain very little metals.\n(\"Metals\" means every element except hydrogen and helium.)\nMetals exist in the Universe because nuclear burning in stars\nprocessed hydrogen and helium into heavier elements. That\nmeans that the first generations of stars had no metals, or at least\nvery small amounts of metals.\n\nOne widely accepted theory of the formation of the\nMilky Way's\nstellar halo posits that small \"building blocks\" called dwarf\nspheroidal galaxies (dSphs) fell into each other by their mutual\ngravitational attraction. Those building blocks are no longer\ndistinct entities but instead a single enormous diffuse cloud of stars\nthat surrounds the Milky Way. However, some dSphs still exist\ntoday. In the hierarchical assembly model, these dSphs would\nbe the rare handful of latecomers to the Milky Way system which have\nnot yet suffered the gravitational interactions that pull the small\ngalaxies apart and melds them into the stellar halo.\n\nRecently, some astronomers claimed that the\nstars in the halo are different enough from the stars in the surviving\ndSphs to cast doubt on the hierarchical assembly model.\nSpecifically, a small fraction of stars in the halo are\nextremely metal-poor. Some have one ten\nthousandth the amount of metals that the Sun has.\nSome have even less. If dSphs built the stellar\nhalo, then even the surviving dSphs should also have some extremely\nmetal-poor stars. The claim is that, on the other hand, some\nsurviving dSphs\u2014specifically the large, luminous ones\u2014do not\ncontain stars that are quite so metal-poor.\n\nBy measuring the metal content of very tiny, very faint\nsurviving dSphs with a new\ntechnique, my group has discovered\nthat certain dSphs do in fact contain stars nearly as metal-poor as\nthose in\nthe stellar halo. The cumulative distribution of metallicity\n([Fe/H]) shown above demonstrates that the extremely metal-poor tail of\nthe\nfaintest surviving dSphs has a shape similar to that of the Milky Way\nstellar halo after all. The discrepancy at [Fe/H] >\n-2.3 is a result of excluding the more luminous surviving dSphs, whose\nstars are on average more metal-rich than the very faint dSphs\nrepresented by the black line.\n\nWhile the discovery of extremely metal-poor stars in some\nsurviving dSphs bolsters the hierarchical assembly model, it does not\nprove that all dSphs contain extremely metal-poor stars.\nTherefore, the claim that the luminous dSphs are devoid of\nvery metal-poor stars may be accurate. The discovery of very\nmetal-poor stars in the faint dSphs warrants a new look at the luminous\ndSphs with the same technique. Presently, it is unclear\nwhether the hierarchical assembly model depends on the\nexistence of extremely metal-poor stars in luminous dSphs. It\nis\npossible that the extremely metal-poor tail of the halo metallicity\ndistribution formed from tiny dSphs alone. Future work will\napply the same technique used to discover the extremely metal-poor\nstars in small, faint dSphs to the stars in large, luminous dSphs.\n\nDetailed tests of\ntheories of\nhierarchical structure formation require chemical abundances of many\nstars at large distances. In additional to overall metallicity, models\npredict the alpha enhancement of\ndifferent dynamical components of the Milky Way and M31. High\ndispersion spectroscopy can probe\nvery few stars in the Milky Way satellite galaxies and no stars in\nM31.\n\nMy dissertation employs a technique\nusing medium resolution spectroscopy and spectral synthesis to extract\nmetallicity and [\u03b1/Fe] for\nlarge samples of individual stars at large distances. I have\nfound that R ~ 6000 spectra\nreproduce high\nresolution [Fe/H] and [\u03b1/Fe] measurements of Galactic globular cluster\nstars. At signal-to-noise ratios for which Milky Way satellites are\neasily accessible, the typical error on metallicity is 0.15 dex, and\nthe typical error on [\u03b1/Fe] is 0.2 dex. Unlike empirical metallicity\nestimators, such as the equivalent width of the Ca II triplet, this\nsynthetic method does not depend on the metallicity range or alpha\nenhancement\nof calibrators.\n\nThis\nplot shows the mean metllaicities of nine Milky Way globular clusters.\nThe horizontal axis is the result from high dispersion\nspectroscopy, and the vertical axis is my result from DEIMOS spectra.\nThree clusters (NGC 2419, M79, and NGC 7492) have fewer than\nfive\nstars observed in high resolution spectroscopy. The\nmeasurements\nwith DEIMOS are based on 32, 16, and 21 stars, respectively.\nDespite the lower spectral resolution, the DEIMOS results may\nbe\nmore precise."}

{"text": "This blob of glowing gas and stars (shown in a false color image) is from roughly 13 billion years ago, a time shortly after the universe formed. In the bar shown for scale, 10 kly stands for 10,000 light-years.\n\nM. Ouchi et al., Astrophysical Journal\n\nUsing a telescope atop a Hawaiian mountain, astronomers recently caught sight of an enormous, newfound glowing object in deep, deep space. If you were an astronomer, what would you call such a thing?\n\nHow about a \"blob\"?\n\nTechnically, the object is called a Lyman-alpha blob, and scientists aren't exactly sure what it is. But they have a guess. Astronomer Masami Ouchi, of the Observatories of the Carnegie Institution for Science in Pasadena, Calif led the team that identified the blob. He and his colleagues think it may be a distant galaxy \u2014 a collection of stars, gas and dust \u2014 caught in the act of a feeding frenzy.\n\nAstronomers have different theories to explain how blobs like Ouchi's came into being. Some suggest that Lyman-alpha blobs are smaller galaxies merging together into one larger galaxy. Other theories suggest cold gas streaming into the galaxy is essentially \"feeding\" it. Still other astronomers suspect that the glowing blob is a cloud of gas heated by a nearby supermassive black hole.\n\nThe galaxy is 12.9 billion light-years from Earth. Light travels at about 186,000 miles per second, so one light-year is the equivalent of about 5.9 trillion miles. The giant blob is very, very far away, about 76.1 billion trillion miles away, in case you're counting. In fact, it's so far away that it's the fourth most distant object ever observed.\n\nWhen we see light from a distant object in the sky \u2014 say, a star \u2014 we're not seeing the object as it is. We're seeing the object as it was when it emitted the light we're seeing now. For example, light takes about eight minutes to travel from the sun to Earth, so when you see the sun, you actually see it as it was eight minutes ago.\n\nIn other words, to look into space is to look back in time. Because the newly discovered blob is 12.9 billion light-years away, it is at least 12.9 billion years old. The universe itself is believed to be about 13 or 14 billion years old, so this blob came into being not long after.\n\nThe blob is about 55,000 light-years across, or about half the diameter of our own galaxy, the Milky Way. To observe the blob, Ouchi and his team used a special telescope that is able to see infrared light coming from space. Infrared light is made of waves with wavelengths that we cannot see with the naked eye. We can feel these waves, though: \"Far\" infrared radiation feels like heat.\n\nAccording to Ouchi's infrared measurements, the number of stars in the blob is equivalent to 40 billion suns. And that number is likely to keep growing since the scientists think the blob is a young galaxy in a growth spurt.\n\n\nB. Urmston\n\nEver heard of Blood Falls? It's freezing cold, far away and hard to reach \u2014 probably not where you're headed on your family vacation this summer.\n\nBlood Falls is at the tip of a giant glacier in Antarctica. As its name suggests, the icy face of Blood Falls is red \u2014 but not from blood. Instead the water gets its hue because it's rich in iron. When the water trickles out from its underground beginnings, the iron is exposed to oxygen in the air and quickly forms the red rust.\n\nIt may not be a tourist hot spot, but Blood Falls is very interesting to scientists who study living creatures. A geomicrobiologist \u2014 someone who studies how tiny organisms affect or use minerals \u2014 recently studied the rusty water and came up with some surprising results.\n\nThe water that feeds Blood Falls probably comes from a salty underground lake. It's home to microbes that surprisingly don't need oxygen to survive. Microbes are tiny organisms, usually invisible to the naked eye. The microbes found in Blood Falls are similar to other microbes that live in the ocean.\n\n\"This briny pond is a unique sort of time capsule,\" says Jill Mikucki, the Dartmouth University geomicrobiologist who led the study of the water seeping from Blood Falls. \"I don't know of any other environment quite like this on earth.\"\n\nWhen she and her team studied the water, they found no oxygen but lots of dissolved iron. They suspect that the underwater reservoir formed when a giant glacier, now 1,300 feet thick, moved over the salty lake at least 1.5 million years ago. This trapped the water and everything in it in an oxygen-free, or anoxic, environment.\n\nUnlike human beings and most other forms of life, the microbes from Blood Falls don't need oxygen to live. Instead, they are able to exist using the iron and sulfates, chemical salts also found in the water. The microbes transfer particles called electrons from the sulfates to the iron.\n\nThe microbes at Blood Falls show that life can exist in even the harshest environments. In addition to giving us more information about our own planet, the study of these \"extremophiles\" may be useful in other scientific areas \u2014 like the search for life on other planets! If scientists find organisms on Earth that live on sulfur and iron, instead of oxygen, researchers might gain a better idea of where to look for life elsewhere in the universe.\n\nPower words: (Yahoo!

She had to go to the bathroom frequently in the middle of the night. She was always thirsty. Even her vision was blurry.\n\nAfter a few tests, the doctor pulled Albright's mother aside.\n\n\"I still remember it very vividly,\" says Ann Albright, now more than 40 years later. \"My mom left the room with the doctor and came back in with tears running down her cheeks.\"\n\nThe verdict: diabetes, a disease that affects the way people process food.\n\nAt the time, the 1960s, the diagnosis meant that young Ann would never have the carefree childhood her mother wanted for her. For the rest of her life, she would have to give herself shots several times a day. She would need to be very careful about what she ate. And she might not realize all of her dreams in life.\n\n\"In the era I was diagnosed, most people were told they'd have a shorter life span,\" Albright says. \"As a little girl with diabetes moving into adulthood, I wondered would I be able to have kids? Would I be able to have a life?\"\n\nScience has come a long way since then, says Albright, partly as a result of her own efforts: She's now a doctor and diabetes researcher at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. Since her diagnosis, researchers have developed better technologies, more effective medicines and a sharper understanding of how diabetes works.\n\nDespite the advances, though, scientists still can't answer a lot of basic questions about what causes diabetes. There still is no cure. And living with the disease remains difficult.\n\n\"Everything changes\" after a diabetes diagnosis, says Ali Reed, a pediatric endocrine fellow at the University of California, San Francisco. \"Life becomes more complicated.\"\n\nWhat's more, diabetes is on the rise \u2014 in both adults and kids. One version of the disease, called type 2 diabetes, is increasing at an especially alarming rate.\n\nDiabetes refers to a group of diseases, but there are two main kinds: type 1 and type 2. In both types, the trouble begins with the body's ability to deal with sugar.\n\nSugar is the body's main fuel source. When you eat, your digestive system breaks down your food into basic parts, including proteins, fats and a simple sugar called glucose. Glucose gets absorbed through the intestines. From there, it enters the bloodstream. Circulating blood delivers glucose to all the cells, which convert it into energy.\n\nAt least, that's what's supposed to happen. In people with diabetes, however, sugar can't get from the bloodstream into the cells. A hormone, or messenger molecule, called insulin is normally responsible for that transfer. But in diabetics, insulin doesn't do its job.\n\nAs a result, sugar builds up in the bloodstream. When levels of sugar in the blood stay high, the condition is called chronic. And for reasons scientists don't yet understand, chronically high blood sugar can lead to blindness, kidney damage, limb amputations, heart attacks and more.\n\n\"It's not a death sentence, but it's a very serious disease,\" Albright says.\n\nTwo types\n\nExactly how diabetes affects a patient's life depends in part on which type of diabetes a person has. There are important differences between the two main types.\n\nType 1 diabetes is the kind Albright has. In this version of the disease, the body stops producing insulin. Symptoms usually begin in kids or teenagers control blood sugar levels. So far, scientists don't know how to prevent type 1 diabetes.\n\nType 2 diabetics make insulin, but their bodies don't use the hormone properly. Type 2 diabetes is far more common than type 1, and most people who have type 2 are adults. These days, though, more and more kids are coming to their doctors with symptoms of type 2 diabetes.\n\nDoctors already know that adults who develop type 2 diabetes tend to be overweight or obese. And as kids have become increasingly overweight, the disease has started appearing at younger and younger ages.\n\nShorrocks/iStockphoto\n\nAs recently as a decade ago, type 2 diabetes was called \"adult-onset\" because kids just didn't get it.\n\n\"When this disease we used to only see in adults started happening in adolescents, it was just shocking to people,\" Albright says. \"Pediatricians just didn't know what to do.\"\n\nHealthy living\n\nDoctors already knew that adults who develop type 2 diabetes tend to be overweight or obese. (Scientists can't yet explain why.) And as kids have become increasingly overweight, the disease has started appearing at younger and younger ages.\n\nIn the United States, two out of three adults are now overweight, according to the CDC. Nineteen percent of kids between the ages of 6 and 11 are overweight, compared with 7 percent just 20 years ago. Over the same period, the proportion of overweight teens rose from 5 percent to 17 percent.\n\n(You can find out whether you are overweight by plugging numbers into a calculator at an online site. Also, see the sidebar \"Understanding Body Mass Index\" at the bottom of this article.)\n\nLike their type 1 peers, type 2 diabetics have to monitor blood sugar levels. But they often rely on drugs instead of insulin shots. Frequently, they can get the disease under control by simply exercising more and eating reasonable portions of healthy foods.\n\n\"We now know that we can prevent or postpone type 2 diabetes by having [adults] at very high risk lose 5 to 7 percent of their body weight,\" Albright says.\n\nScientists don't yet know whether the same is true for overweight kids. The trend is so new that CDC researchers are still working to gather basic information about how the disease works in young people.\n\n\"There's no harm in having healthier lifestyle habits,\" Albright says. \"Get to know what's going into your body. Make it fun.\"\n\nSeeking answers\n\nWeighing more than you should doesn't mean you're doomed to develop diabetes. The disease is far more complex than that. And while research has come a long way, plenty of questions remain.\n\nDoctors don't know, for example, why certain ethnic groups have particularly high rates of diabetes, including American Indians, Hispanics and African Americans. Nor can doctors say for sure why the chances of getting diabetes go up if your parents or siblings have it.\n\nBoth relationships suggest that genes play a role in setting people up for diabetes. But something in the environment has to push those genes into action, and scientists aren't sure what those triggers are. It's also not clear which genes are involved.\n\nIf you learn you have diabetes, don't despair. There's plenty you can do to live a long and healthy life. Also, know you're not alone.\n\nReed encourages all newly diagnosed kids to go to one of the nation's many diabetes camps. It can be hugely reassuring, she says, to be surrounded by other kids who feel like you do.\n\n\"It's really amazing,\" Reed says. \"It's a very supportive and tolerating environment for kids who are often the only ones at their school with diabetes. At diabetes camp, everyone is going through it together.\"\n\nBrown fat (black) shows up in a PET-CT scan of a man after exposure to cold (right) but is not as apparent in a scan at room temperature (left).\n\nW. Van Marken Lichtenbelt\n\nThe human body hides more than one\nkind of fat. White fat cells, which we usually think of when we think of fat,\nstore energy. But brown fat is different: It's a type of fat that burns energy\nand gives off heat.\n\nWhen you were born, you had a pad\nof brown fat on your back, and it helped you control your body temperature.\nMice also have brown fat on their backs. Until now, scientists suspected human\nadults don't have brown fat \u2014 or if they do, the brown fat is not important.\n\nThree recent studies show that\nhuman adults do have brown fat, and it may be important for controlling body\nweight. And unlike babies, adults store brown fat in the neck, abdomen, above\nthe collarbone and along the spine.\n\nIn the first study, researcher Ronald Kahn of the Joslin Diabetes Center and Harvard Medical School\nin Boston looked at the medical records of nearly 2,000 people who had received a PET-CT scan. To get a PET, or\npositron emission tomography, scan, a person is injected with a chemical that\nemits particles called positrons. Inside the person's body, these positrons\ncreate radiation called gamma rays, which pass through the body and are\ndetected by special machines outside the body. This type of scan provides a three-dimensional\npicture of what's going on inside the body. PET scans are often used to\ndiagnose cancer. A CT scan uses\nX-rays to see inside a body.\n\nKahn and his team found brown fat\nin the scans of 3.1 percent of the men studied and 7.5 percent of the women.\nPeople younger than 50 and lean people were more likely to have brown fat.\n\n\"It is now without dispute that\nbrown fat is present in adult humans,\" Kahn says.\n\nWhen the researchers checked the\nscans against the weather records, they found that brown fat was more likely to\nshow up when the temperature outside was cold. This comparison suggests brown\nfat burns more energy in colder temperatures.\n\nThe connection between brown fat\nand temperature was explored in the second study. Dutch researchers took scans\nof lean and overweight men at two temperatures, 72 degrees Fahrenheit (room\ntemperature) and 61 degrees Fahrenheit. At the higher temperature, brown fat\nbarely appeared on the scans. But when the temperature dropped, brown fat\nappeared on the scans of the leaner men. The more overweight the man, the less\nbrown fat appeared. The third study, conducted by Swedish scientists, also\nfound evidence of brown fat in adults.\n\nThese studies suggest that brown\nfat may burn more energy in people who are lean. The connection between brown\nfat and being overweight is less clear. Scientists wonder: Does having less\nbrown fat cause a person to become overweight, or does being overweight reduce\nthe amount of brown fat in a person?\n\nIn other words, overweight people\nmay be overweight partially because they don't have enough brown fat to help burn\nenergy. On the other hand, their excessive amount of white fat may keep the\nbrown fat from burning energy.\n\nPower words: (from Britannica.com and the Yahoo!

Hagadorn\n\nMany modern animals, like crabs, live in shells and carry their homes around with them. Picture one of these animals in your mind, and you may have some idea of what the first land-dwelling animals looked like. After studying strange marks that accompany some sets of ancient fossil footprints, scientists recently suggested that the oldest creatures to crawl out of the ocean probably wore shells.\n\nScientists have long known that life on Earth began in the sea. The first vertebrates \u2014 animals with backbones \u2014 came crawling out of the water between 385 million and 376 million years ago. But those animals weren't the first creatures to come ashore, says paleontologist James W. Hagadorn of Amherst College in Massachussetts.\n\nHagadorn and Yale University paleontologist Adolf Seilacher say that a different group of animals, called arthropods, probably beat the first land vertebrates by more than 100 million years. Arthropods are animals that lack a backbone and have a hard exoskeleton. Examples include modern-day scorpions and insects. These ancient arthropods may have dragged themselves out of the ocean 500 million years ago.\n\nThese ancient arthropods had the right kind of bodies to survive out of the water, says Hagadorn. Their hard exoskeletons would have kept them from drying out too quickly. And though these creatures breathed through gills, which require water, a shell would have trapped humid air. This handy gear would allow the animals to keep their gills moist.\n\nThe paleontologists found evidence for the shells by studying fossilized, or preserved, tracks discovered in central Wisconsin. The tracks were left by the ancient arthropods as they walked around on soft ground. Over time, this soft ground hardened, and the tracks remained as etchings in stone.\n\nWhen the scientists looked at the fossilized tracks, they found something strange. Some of the tracks included an extra mark alongside the footprints. Whenever the tracks turned, to the right or to the left, the extra mark swung out a little wider, always to the left. The scientists realized this mark could not have been made by a tail, because a tail would swing out wider on both sides. If the animal turned left, a tail\nwould have swung right; if the animal turned right, a tail would have swung left.\n\nBecause the mark swung out on one side only, the scientists believe it was made by a shell that dragged on the ground. Furthermore, they suspect the shell was coiled, probably in a right-hand spiral.\n\n\"This is an exciting find,\" says Sally E. Walker, a paleobiologist at the University of Georgia in Athens. Now, she says, scientists can approach these ancient arthropods from a different direction. They can study ancient shells to look for scratch marks on the outside that might have been made as the shells were dragged through the sand. Or, she says, researchers can look for scratch marks on the inside \u2014 which may suggest that another animal took over a shell, after the original animal that lived there died.\n\nPower words: (from the Yahoo!

The ship dumped about 11 million gallons of crude oil into the freezing water, creating the largest spill in U.S. history \u2014 and a disaster for animals that lived in or near the water.\n\nNow, 20 years later, the area still has not fully recovered. At the time of the spill, two groups of orcas, or killer whales, were swimming in the area. One of these groups of whales appears to be headed for extinction, and the other is recovering more slowly than scientists had predicted.\n\nThe first group, called AT-1, wasn't large to begin with: When the spill happened, the group had 22 whales. Nine of these whales died during the spill, and since then, no baby whales have been born in the group. The older males \u2014 who can live to be 60 \u2014 have been dying off. Now, only seven whales remain.\n\nThese orcas may look like and live in the same areas as other killer whales, but orcas in the AT-1 group are genetically different and communicate with a different set of sounds. They are transient orcas, which have larger home ranges than the other kind of killer whales, called resident orcas. Transient orcas eat mammals, such as harbor seals, sea lions, porpoises and other whales; resident orcas eat fish. These two types of killer whales don't breed with each other.\n\nLingering effects from the oil spill are not the only threats to orcas. The whales are swimming in polluted waters, and scientists have found these pollutants in the whales' blubber (or fat). These toxic substances may keep the whales from reproducing successfully. The pollution probably originated in plumes of air that wafted across the Pacific from China and Southeast Asia, says Craig Matkin, a marine mammal biologist who studies the whales.\n\n\"I don't want to make it sound like the oil spill is solely responsible for [this group of whales'] decline,\" Matkin says. \"It just exacerbated an already bad situation.\"\n\nThis male from the AT-1 population of transient orcas exhibits a curiously stunted, or small, dorsal fin.\n\nMatkin/NGOS\n\nThe other group of endangered whales eats fish and squid. These are resident killer whales, and their group is called AB. After the spill, 13 whales in this group died. Scientists predicted the population would recover \u2014 that is, return to its original size \u2014 within 12 years. But they were wrong. The whales that died were mostly females and juveniles. Now, 20 years later, scientists think the AB group of whales will not recover for another 10 years.\n\nThe oil spill also broke up the family structure of the whales. Groups of orcas live in matriarchal communities, where a female acts as the head of the family. The matriarch of the AB group apparently died in the oil spill, and afterward many whales left to join a different group.\n\nWhen the AB group does eventually recover, it won't be the same. And the AT-1 group may become extinct. Other scientists are finding that certain other major species affected by the oil-spill \u2014 like otters, clams, herring and certain birds \u2014 have also failed to fully recover. And in many cases, they're surprised about why, 20 years after the spill, so many effects of the Exxon Valdez disaster still persist.\n\nPower words: (from the Yahoo!

The deep black color tells researchers that the rock is rich in carbon.\n\nNature\n\nOn October 7, 2008, an asteroid the size of a car blazed through the atmosphere and crashed into the Nubian Desert in the African nation of Sudan. Eyewitnesses who were looking up at the sky at the time reported seeing a fireball over the desert when the asteroid, named 2008 TC3, exploded into pieces.\n\nSome people weren't surprised by all the fireworks though. For the first time in history, scientists were able to watch the asteroid as it flew through space, then entered Earth's atmosphere and crashed into the desert. 2008 TC3 is the first asteroid to be observed both in space and on Earth. Before this asteroid's arrival, scientists have had to rely on data from one place or the other.\n\nAsteroids the size of 2008 TC3 are not uncommon, and fragments from one usually strike Earth every year. Because they are so small, Earth-bound asteroids usually remain unseen until they enter our atmosphere. Larger asteroids are easier to see, but are more rare.\n\n\"It's like when bugs splatter on the windshield. You don't see the bug until it's too late,\" says Mark Boslough, a physicist at Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque, N.M., who has studied the asteroid's collision. \"You'd see a baseball coming towards the windshield much sooner.\"\n\nIn the case of 2008 TC3, the astronomers who first observed it got lucky. They didn't know they were going to see it. \"It just so happened that the asteroid was coming from the direction that the telescope was pointed in,\" says astronomer Peter Jenniskens of the SETI Institute in Mountain View, Calif. The astronomers first saw the asteroid on October 6, through a telescope on a mountain near Tucson, Ariz.\n\nAs they watched 2008 TC3 move across the sky, the scientists studied its mineral composition by observing how the asteroid reflected sunlight. They also used tracking equipment to correctly predict when the asteroid would impact Earth. Shortly after the collision, Jenniskens and a team of astronomers and students from Sudan headed out into the desert to look for meteorites, pieces of the asteroid that survived the fiery trip through the atmosphere and landed on Earth. The team brought back about 47 meteorites from 2008 TC3.\n\nOnce they were able to study the fragments in the laboratory, the scientists quickly realized that the 2008 TC3 meteorites were unlike anything they had seen or studied before. More research on the pieces gave the scientists new information about the characteristics of different kinds of meteorites.\n\nIn addition to helping scientists understand more about asteroids, 2008 TC3 may prove to be helpful to humankind in the future. If a larger and more dangerous asteroid ever comes crashing toward Earth, scientists might see it coming.\n\nPower words: (Adapted from the Yahoo!

Primack, anonymous\n\nIt's not just Daylight Savings Time that came early this year. All around the world, spring seems to be coming sooner than it used to. It hasn't moved up on the calendar \u2014 but many cycles in nature are telling us that spring just can't wait to be sprung.\n\nDandelions push through the soil and bloom weeks earlier than they did decades ago. Robins who migrated for the winter are shortening their stays down south. In some places, butterflies usually not seen until July have been flitting about since January. That's great, right? After all, nearly everyone looks forward to spring's arrival after a long, cold winter.\n\nNot so fast, say many scientists. A growing body of evidence suggests these shifts in timing are coming about because of climate change. And these changes might spell trouble for the countless species of plants and animals that depend on one another.\n\nTiming is everything\n\n\"The timing of life cycles in nature really matters a lot,\" says Abe Miller-Rushing, a scientist at the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory in Crested Butte, Colo. Miller-Rushing is one of a growing number of scientists investigating how climate change affects the timing of events in nature.\n\n\"Many organisms time their life cycles with the seasons,\" he says. \"Relationships between species could be disrupted as a result of changes in timing.\"\n\nClimate change, however, is a long-term phenomenon. To confidently say that climate change affects natural cycles, such as the date when maple trees first unfurl their leaves, scientists need to document what day the event occurs over many years. Then, they need to compare those dates with climate factors such as average temperature or rainfall over long periods of time \u2014 ideally decades. Finally, they need to figure out if changes in the timing of natural events are connected to changes in climate patterns.\n\n\"One of the big limitations to understanding how climate change affects plants and animals is you need data from a long time, and there just isn't a lot of that out there,\" Miller-Rushing says.So scientists need to be creative in their hunt for data.\n\nTurning to history\n\nMiller-Rushing turned to a long-dead figure in American history and literature for help. Henry David Thoreau, a writer and naturalist who lived in suburban Boston during the mid-1800s, kept detailed diaries of the natural cycles in his surroundings. In these diaries, he recorded the flowering times of hundreds of plants in eastern Massachusetts.\n\nKids in Arizona inspect plants for hints of early flowering.\n\nD. Amber\n\nTo compare Thoreau's observations with today's cycles, Miller-Rushing and his colleague at Boston University tracked the first flowering date for 43 of those species during the years 2004, 2005 and 2006.\n\nThey found that plants like violets and buttercups are blooming on average seven days earlier than they did in Thoreau's time. And some species, such as wild blueberries, bloom three weeks earlier than they did 150 years ago.\n\nSeven days might not seem like that much time. But many plants rely on insects to move their pollen from one flower to another \u2014 a crucial step in plant reproduction. And some plants only produce flowers for about a week, says Richard Primack, a conservation biologist at Boston University.\n\n\"If flowering shifts a week or two earlier and the insects that pollinate it are not coming out, it's possible that the species won't be pollinated, and it won't set fruit,\" Primack says.\n\nThat's significant for two reasons. First, when a plant \"sets fruit,\" it makes the seeds that will become the next generation of plants. If a plant doesn't set fruit, it doesn't reproduce.\n\nSecond, many birds rely on fruit as a food source \u2014 especially in the fall when they are building up their energy stores to migrate south for the winter. If plants aren't pollinated in the spring, this food resource won't exist in the fall.\n\nBut scientists are still learning how climate change may affect communities of plants and animals. \"Right now, we only know the relationships are changing,\" Primack says. \"Now we're actively researching the effect these changing relationships will have on species.\"\n\nIt's not only wildlife that's feeling the effects of these shifting cycles, says Christine Rogers. She is a biologist at the University of Massachusetts Amherst who studies how pollen, fungal spores and bacteria in the air affect people. She says kids with allergies might be sniffling and sneezing earlier than ever before.\n\n\"We know that the spring seasons are coming earlier, and that means the pollen people are allergic to is coming out earlier,\" she says. \"The timing of the allergy season is shifting to an earlier time period.\n\nCitizen scientists\n\nUnderstanding how nature responds to climate change will require monitoring key life cycle events \u2014 flowering, the appearance of leaves, the first frog calls of the spring \u2014 all around the world. But ecologists can't be everywhere so they're turning to non-scientists, sometimes called citizen scientists, for help.\n\nA group of scientists and educators launched an organization last year called the National Phenology Network. \"Phenology\" is what scientists call the study of the timing of events in nature.\n\nOne of the group's first efforts relies on scientists and non-scientists alike to collect data about plant flowering and leafing every year. The program, called Project BudBurst, collects life cycle data on a variety of common plants from across the United States. People participating in the project \u2014 which is open to everyone \u2014 record their observations on the Project BudBurst website.\n\n\"People don't have to be plant experts \u2014 they just have to look around and see what's in their neighborhood,\" says Jennifer Schwartz, an education consultant with the project. \"As we collect this data, we'll be able to make projections about how plants and communities of plants and animals will respond as the climate changes.\"\n\nThat data will help scientists predict not only how natural communities may change but also how these changes will affect people, says Jake Weltzin. He's the executive director of the National Phenology Network.\n\nWeltzin says scientists monitoring lilac flowering in the western United States reported that in years when lilacs bloomed early \u2014 before May 20th \u2014 wildfires later in the summer and fall tended to be larger and more severe. Lilac blooming, then, could serve as an alarm bell, he says.\n\n\"If we had a network of people collecting this information, scientists could use that information to come up with a nationwide tool for predicting fires in the west,\" Weltzin says.\n\nDown the road, he says the National Phenology Network plans to coordinate with other monitoring programs, such as the Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology's Great Backyard Bird Count, the University of Kansas' Monarch Watch or the National Wildlife Federation's FrogWatch USA. Closer coordination will help scientists recognize new patterns, such as whether a change in the timing of flowering affects insect population levels.\n\nImproved monitoring is an important step toward predicting how natural communities will respond to climate change, Miller-Rushing says.\n\n\"The best way for us to increase our knowledge of how plants and animals are responding to climate change is to increase the amount of data we have,\" he says. \"That's why we need citizen scientists to get as much information from as many places on as many species over as long a time period as we can.\"\n\n\nOne of the most important ways that scientists group stars is by size. In the early 20th century, just before World War I, astronomers began to put stars into two main size groups: dwarfs and giants.\n\n\"Once they discovered that there was a class of stars really big, called giants, they carved the universe up into dwarfs and giants,\" says Jim Holberg, a scientist who studies dwarf stars at the University of Arizona in Tucson. \"The giants are enormous stars, and dwarfs are stars like the sun.\"\n\nDespite their name, most dwarf stars are not unusually small. Or unusual at all: Most stars, in fact, are dwarfs of one kind or another. But within the large category of dwarf stars are other groups of stars. Keeping track of the different kinds of dwarfs can be difficult, but that's all in a day's work for astronomers.\n\nA brown dwarf mystery: planets, stars or neither?\n\nThe tiny dot on the right side of this picture is the first verified image of a brown dwarf. This image was taken in 1995 by a camera onboard the Hubble Space Telescope. The brown dwarf shown here is orbiting a much larger, brighter star called Gliese 229\n\nS. Durrance and D. Golimowski (JHU), NASA\n\nSome objects are so strange that even astronomers aren't sure what to call them. One of these kinds of objects behaves like a star, but it's not very hot \u2014 and it's too small. Plus, through a telescope, it resembles a planet \u2014 but it's too big to be called one. What would you call it? A star-net? A planet-ar?\n\nAn American astronomer named Shiv Kumar first predicted these strange objects might exist in 1963, and he called them black dwarfs. That name didn't stick, and ten years later another astronomer suggested the name brown dwarfs. That name stuck.\n\nBut there was another problem: Even though astronomers like Kumar could use information to imagine how brown dwarfs should behave, no one had ever seen one. It wasn't until 1995 \u2014 just 14 years ago \u2014 that astronomers first saw one of these brown dwarfs. Since that first discovery, astronomers have found hundreds more brown dwarfs.\n\nThanks to more scientists looking for these stars, and better telescopes to see them with, astronomers now know more about brown dwarfs. As it turns out, they aren't even brown. They are almost totally dark in the sky, producing no visible light. Instead, they emit infrared light, which is so faint it can only be detected by sophisticated telescopes.\n\nWhen you see a star in the sky, it looks like a calm, twinkling light. Your eyes deceive you, however. A star is anything but calm: What you are really looking at it is a giant, fiery ball of burning gas. For most stars, that gas is hydrogen, the lightest element in the universe. Hydrogen is the fuel for stars, just as gasoline is the fuel for most modern cars.\n\nStars are powered by a process called fusion, where hydrogen atoms join together to form helium \u2014 and give off a lot of energy. Like stars, brown dwarfs have a lot of hydrogen. But unlike other stars, brown dwarfs don't have enough mass to start the fusion process. So instead of burning bright and hot their whole lives, brown dwarfs smolder slowly and don't technically qualify as stars.\n\nThis illustration of a brown dwarf studied by Phan Bao Ngoc and other scientists shows jets of gas shooting out. These jets tell astronomers that the brown dwarf formed more like a star than a planet.\n\nDavid A. Aguilar (Harvard Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics)\n\nIn December 2008, astronomer Phan Bao Ngoc, who studies brown dwarfs at the Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics in Taiwan, and a team of scientists solved one mystery about brown dwarfs. They showed that brown dwarfs shoot out a stream of gas into space \u2014 like stars. Thus, the strange objects seem to form more like stars than like planets. But, Ngoc cautions, that doesn't make them stars. \"It is still too early to say this settles all debate. We need to observe more young brown dwarfs,\" he says. \"This opens a new window and provides an important clue for the brown dwarf formation theory.\"\n\nRed dwarf stars: the most popular stars you'll never see\n\nIn April 2007, astronomers introduced a planet circling a red dwarf called Gliese 581 c, illustrated here. The planet is only a little larger than Earth, and though it probably could not sustain life, the discovery gives hope to scientists who are looking\n\nESO\n\nObjects in space that have just a little more mass than brown dwarfs are called red dwarf stars. Red dwarfs may not be much larger than brown dwarfs, but that small increase in size makes a big difference. Red dwarf stars are massive enough to support hydrogen fusion, like the sun. And they're also technically stars.\n\nBut unlike the sun, red dwarfs don't shine in the sky. \"They're less massive, and they don't produce as much energy,\" says Holberg. \"They don't have a strong energy source, so they're burning at a low rate.\" Most of the energy red dwarfs produce is invisible to the naked eye but visible to high-powered telescopes.\n\nDespite the difficulty in finding these stars, astronomers believe that most of the stars in our galaxy are red dwarfs. The sun's nearest neighbor, Proxima Centauri, is a red dwarf more than 20 trillion miles away. Most of our nearest star neighbors are red dwarfs.\n\nAstronomers who are looking for life on distant planets are particularly interested in red dwarfs. Some of the planets that have been found outside our solar system are in orbit around red dwarfs. If the planets are enough like Earth, then they may support life. In April 2007, a planet in orbit around a red dwarf was discovered to be only slightly bigger than Earth, but astronomers later determined that life could probably not exist there.\n\nWhite dwarf stars: the end of the line\n\nThe white dwarf in this picture is not the giant star in the center \u2014 it's the tiny dot in the lower left-hand corner. Called Sirius B, it is the closest white dwarf to Earth. The star in the center is Sirius, the brightest star in the night sky\n\nNASA, ESA, H. Bond (STScI) and M. Barstow (University of Leicester)\n\nAfter a long life of burning hydrogen, a star eventually runs out of fuel. At this point, the star grows and grows and grows into something called a red giant. These giant stars can be hundreds of times as large as the sun, and when theyburn up, all that's left is the hot core of the star. This hot core is yet another kind of dwarf star.\n\n\"The star shrinks to something the size of the planet Earth,\" says Holberg. There is no more fuel to burn, but the star is so hot that it blazes as it cools down. Over billions of years, he says, the heat leaks out. \"Because the star is so small, it's like pushing all the water at a dam through a small hole.\"\n\nHolberg says that nearly all the stars in our galaxy \u2014 about 97 percent \u2014 are destined to become white dwarfs. Even among dwarfs, white dwarfs go against expectations. Oddly, the smallest white dwarfs actually have the most mass, and the largest white dwarfs have the least. So the more mass, the smaller the dwarf. For comparison, imagine that you had a magic balloon that deflatedas you blew into it. When a white dwarf cools down, it becomes a black dwarf, a dense, cold object in the sky that astronomers have never seen.\n\nMukremin Kilic, who started studying astronomy after watching a solar eclipse, says that white dwarfs can help scientists determine the age of one part of the galaxy. But there's an even more exciting reason to study these stars, says Kilic, at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Mass. He is most interested in studying the planets that orbit white dwarfs because, he says, these planets might help scientists figure out how Earth will end.\n\nAt the end of its life, the sun will become a white dwarf. But before this happens, the sun will expand, like a balloon of fire, into its red giant phase. \"The sun will become a giant one day and swallow planets,\" he says. \"What's going to survive?\"\n\nAs a giant, the sun will absorb and disintegrate the closest planet, Mercury. Then, as the sun gets bigger, it will absorb our nearest neighbor, the planet Venus. Bye-bye, Venus. But astronomers aren't sure what happens then \u2014 will the sun finally destroy Earth before becoming a small white dwarf?\n\nDon't worry, says Holberg, we've got plenty of time to figure that out: \"The sun won't go through this phase for another 5 billion years or so.\"\n\nA recent study suggests that some children may be able to beat back their allergic reactions to peanuts by gradually introducing trace amounts of the nut into their diets.\n\nScott Bauer/USDA-ARS\n\nPeanut allergies are among the most common and most dangerous food allergies. A tiny exposure to peanuts can mean big trouble for a person with a peanut allergy, with symptoms ranging from sneezing or coughing to the constriction, or narrowing, of airways. Some people die from the exposure.\n\nBut a tiny exposure may help scientists find a cure. A recent study suggests that some children may be able to beat back their allergic reactions to peanuts by gradually introducing trace amounts of the nut into their diets. It's too early to say for certain, so if you have a peanut allergy, do not try this at home. But the first results look promising.\n\nTwo teams of scientists have been experimenting on a group of 29 children, with an average age five years old, who are allergic to peanuts. At the beginning of the study, each kid received less than 1/1,000th of a peanut per day. (Imagine splitting a peanut into 1,000 parts!) Over the course of the study, the children gradually increased the amount of peanuts in their diets. At home, their parents sprinkled peanut powder on their food, and in the laboratory, the children drank solutions with peanuts dissolved inside.\n\nNine of the children have been receiving the treatment for two years. Five of those nine now appear to be free of their peanut allergies, says Wesley Burks, a pediatric allergist and immunologist at Duke University Medical Center in Durham, N.C. These five kids can eat peanuts with no problem. \"They are putting peanuts in their diet,\" Burks says.\n\nOf those nine, the other four have not benefited as much from the therapy. Burks and his team will release data from the other 20 children in the study later this year.\n\nThe two teams of scientists are now doing a follow-up study on two groups of children with the allergy. Children in one group will receive the gradual peanut therapy, and the others will not. Burks and the other researchers hope this study will help them learn if the therapy truly works or not.\n\nThe study raises many questions, both from parents of children with the allergies and from other doctors. Scott Sicherer, an allergist at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York City, asks, \"Have we really cured the allergy, or are [the patients] just desensitized while they are getting the treatment?\"\n\nScientists don't understand why some people get peanut allergies and others don't, but they're scrambling to find a way to help people with the allergy. Because of the severity of a peanut allergy, scientists want to know as soon as possible. \"This is very encouraging, but it's not something you try at home,\" says Sicherer.\n\nPower words: (from the Yahoo!

{"text": "Saturday, May 16, 2009\n\nDoes the universe actually look like that?\n\nOkay, I'll admit it, the last post had a lot of math. For those who are less inclined to slog through equations, let's talk about all those astronomical pretty pictures we see.\n\nKarl asks:\n\nI always hear that photos of cosmological objects (like that photo of the Ring Nebula in your previous post) have been enhanced in some way. What would those things look like if we just saw them exactly as the telescope or camera picked them up? And when the photos are enhanced, are they always enhanced the same way, or does the formula vary?\n\nFinally, does the enhancing serve some scientific purpose, or is it done basically to make the pictures prettier? (I suppose that's a scientific purpose too, in the long view, since pretty pictures make it easier to get funding. Don't worry, I won't tell!)\n\nSo, it's totally true, the final images given out for press releases have usually been heavily processed from the original raw images. Just like the pictures you took at a party where you throw them into photoshop and remove your friends' red-eye, there are a set of \"standard\" processing steps for astronomical images.\n\nThat said, there's usually not outright deception the way advertisers airbrush images - no astronomer is going to try and make their planet look skinnier or add lolcat tags. To understand this a little better, let's talk about how modern astronomical images are actually taken.\n\nFirst off, almost all optical images are taken with a Charged Coupled Device (CCD) mounted to the back of a telescope. This is the same kind of chip that's in the back of your ordinary digital camera, albeit more sensitive and more expensive. Essentially, it's just a thin piece of silicon divided into a narrowly-spaced grid of cells. Each cell in the grid can hold electrons which might get excited when a photon hits them. At the end of an exposure, each cell reports how many energetic electrons it contains. Our image just translates each cell into a pixel, and the brightness of that pixel is just how many electrons it contains.\n\nNow, notice there's absolutely no color information here. The CCD just reports the number of excited electrons, and doesn't know anything about whether it was a red photon or a blue photon which excited it...so this just produces a black & white photo. This means we have to use filters if we want to get any color information. If we put, say, a red filter on our CCD before taking the image, then we know only red photons can get through.\n\nSo, first we take an exposure with a red filter, then another with a green filter, and then another with a blue filter. We combine them all at the end to produce our fancy color image.\n\nOkay, you're probably already asking, \"then how does my digital camera takes color photos all at once without any color filters?\" The answer is that it uses filters all the time - here's a schematic of the filter mosaic used in most digital camera CCDs. By filtering alternating pixels with different colors, in only one exposure the camera can get an image in each filter...albeit at lower resolution than the entire grid. The fancy camera software then interpolates these separate staggered color images to produce a single color image.\n\nSo with all this said, let's take a look at an actual single raw image of a galaxy:\n\nYou'll want to click on the image above to look at the original with all its glorious artifacts. Let's also take a look at close-up with some artifacts highlighted:\n\nSo, there's several issues we have to contend with to make this into a \"pretty picture\".\n\nIn red, I've highlighted a particularly annoying cosmic ray trail (though they're all over the image). Unlike digital camera photos which only open the shutter for a fraction of a second, astronomical images - particularly of faint objects - can be upwards of an hour long. During this time, high-energy particles known as cosmic rays - which are always whizzing around - have a much greater chance of interacting with your CCD and exciting electrons completely independent of any photons coming through the telescope. The annoying ones come in at an oblique angle to the CCD, leaving a trail of excited electrons across the chip. The even more annoying ones do this directly over the CCD cells you're using to capture an image of your object. Thankfully, there are some pretty good cosmic ray removal packages out there which use sophisticated image detection algorithms to remove this...so that's a processing step right there.\n\nIn blue, I've highlighted pixel bleed. We're going for a long exposure of a pretty faint galaxy here, so any bright stars in the field will become oversaturated. In essence, the CCD cell containing the image of the bright star begins to overflow with energetic electrons, pouring them out into adjacent cells.\n\nIn green, I've highlighted a row of bad pixels. With millions of cells across the entire chip, statistically many are eventually going to fail. For earth-based observatories, it's untenable to keep throwing out CCDs which cost many thousands of dollars whenever some pixels go out...so you work around it. For spacecraft, meanwhile, there's really nothing you can do about bad pixels even if you had the money to replace it.\n\nThere's a couple other artifacts noticeable in the original image, as well. Notice the steady gradient of dark-to-light in the background. Unfortunately, not all the pixels have the same sensitivity. Send 100 photons to one cell, and you might get 50 excited electrons...send them to another cell, and you might only get 40.\n\nYou have to account for this by taking \"flat fields\". Essentially, you take images (ideally just before or just after taking your astronomical images) of a uniformly lit surface with each color filter. The idea is that the surface should be sending out a constant number of photons to each cell, so the only signal you'll see will be the change in sensitivity across the CCD. You then divide the astronomical image by the flat field on a pixel-by-pixel basis to remove this sensitivity effect. Finding a truly flat field, though, can be a chore in itself...often times the best flat field you'll get is an image of the twilight sky before the stars come out.\n\nAnother artifact you may notice in the original is the weird wavy pattern, particularly noticeable on the left. Ideally you want your CCD chip to be as thin a piece of silicon as possible - this makes it more sensitive. However, particularly for longer wavelengths of light, photons reflecting off the back surface of the CCD can interfere with photons hitting the front surface and produce thin film interference - very similar to the wavy colored patterns you'll see in soap bubbles or with oil on water. Hopefully this too will be removed by flat-fielding.\n\nFinally, as for the purpose of enhancing images, all of the above steps are necessary to get good science. Otherwise, you're just measuring your signal buried in a whole lot of noise. If you're going to take an image this far, though, you might as well go one step further to make a press release photo.\n\nThis serves several purposes, but not least of which is to share your own fascination of an astronomical object with the general public. Imagine if the Hubble Space Telescope *never* made press release photos available and only was used for hard science in the journals...public support wouldn't be nearly what it is today. Besides, it's the taxpayer's dollar which goes to fund it - the least we can do is give them some pretty pictures in return.\n\nSo, if you want to make a pretty picture, there's one more step you'll have to take - and this is a big one - because the above image was taken through an infrared filter. By definition, the human eye can't see this wavelength of light, so if we were to represent it in \"true-color\", the entire image should be black.\n\nCreatively mapping various single filtered images to RGB space as well as some tweaking of colors needs to happen to for this to be visible - and aesthetically pleasing - for human vision. This color manipulation doesn't have the same tried-and-true formula as the above sequence of processing steps, and is often just manipulated until one gets something that just \"looks good\".\n\n37 comments:\n\nI agree with Lluvia, I'm learning so much from you. What kinda urks me a bit is that based on this information, I really can't trust the \"picture\" I get from my camera. Is it an industry thing to give us what we want to see instead of what's really there?\n\nThank you, Planetary Astronomer Mike! What a terrifically detailed answer -- once again, I learn even more than I expected to.\n\nA couple of questions:\n\nDoes per-pixel sensitivity change over time? In other words, is there some reason not to take the baseline flat field on Earth, using some kind of specially-built uniform lamp, before launching the CCD into space? Or would the data gathered by that artifically perfect flat field just become obsolete as pixel sensitivities change over time anyway?\n\nAnd as for color-mapping down into RGB space: it's interesting that you used the word \"creatively\" :-). Is there some reason just uniformly upshifting (or downshifting, in the case of ultraviolet) wouldn't do the trick? I'd somehow feel that's more \"accurate\", since it's just a straight multiplication or division, but maybe that's naive...\n\nBy \"can't trust the picture\" you mean that your camera interpolates separate color images from a lower-resolution grid of filters?\n\nI don't think it's the industry getting us down so much as an issue that if you did take a picture first with red, then green, then blue filters, in that time your subject would probably have moved in the frame.\n\nThis isn't too much of a problem for astronomy since stuff doesn't move that quickly...except for transient events. High-res images of Jupiter can have color blurring since the planet rotates so quickly (only 10 hours).\n\nThe other option for digital cameras is the new Foveon CCD:\n\n\n\nIt's technically 3 CCDs stacked on one another. The top CCD only detects blue light and allows green and red light to pass through. The next CCD detects green light and allows red light through. The bottom one detects red light. So, you can get full resolution images in each color with a single exposure and no need for interpolation algorithms.\n\nHowever, you can expect to pay an arm and quite possibly a leg for this technology.\n\nIt really depends on the specific CCD, but in general, pixel sensitivity changes a lot over both time and temperature. When observing from Earth-based observatories, you almost always want to take flat fields each night, and ideally throughout the course of the night as the temperature changes (if you're really want to calibrate your images well(.\n\nThat said, the recently-removed WFPC2 instrument on Hubble is surprisingly stable. Still, getting occasional flat-fields is still necessary...they do this by actually pointing the Hubble back at Earth. Because the Hubble is moving around the planet so quickly, the images are smeared out, producing a pretty uniform field.\n\nAs for color upshifting/downshifting, that's generally what's done. However, a lot of observations might be done in, say, 6 different filters including both UV and IR...mapping that to only 3 visible color channels may require some creativity.\n\nIt gets even more complicated when some of those filters are extremely narrow for the sake of detecting some property other than just color. For example, the narrow near-IR filter at the 889 nanometer absorption line of methane ultimately probes vertical height in the giant planets. Having only one color dedicated to vertical height seems a little wonky, so scientists will often favor a mapping which is decidedly \"false color\", e.g. this image of Jupiter:\n\nUniverse that's my passion my favorite topic, I'm totally surprised with those images, when I get into those topics I feel like in a viagra online travel around the space and galaxies, I feel flying and get inspiration.\n\nQuestion 2: When (if ever) do you guys plan on bringing back the switch characters button?

{"text": "The interstellar medium, composed primarily of gas and dust, occupies the regions between the stars. On average, it contains less than one atom in each cubic centimetre, with about 1 percent of its mass in the form of minute dust grains. The gas, mostly hydrogen, has been mapped by means of its 21-cm emission line. The gas also contains numerous molecules. Some of these have been detected by the visible-wavelength absorption lines that they impose on the spectra of more-distant stars, while others have been identified by their own emission lines at millimetre wavelengths. Many of the interstellar molecules are found in giant molecular clouds, wherein complex organic molecules have been discovered.\n\nIn the vicinity of a very hot O- or B-type star, the intensity of ultraviolet radiation is sufficiently high to ionize the surrounding hydrogen out to a distance as great as 100 parsecs to produce an H II region, known as a Str\u00f6mgren sphere. Such regions are strong and characteristic emitters of radiation at radio wavelengths, and their dimensions are well calibrated in terms of the luminosity of the central star. Using radio interferometers, astronomers are able to measure the angular diameters of H II regions even in some external galaxies and can thereby deduce the great distances to those remote systems. This method can be used for distances up to about 30 megaparsecs. (For additional information on H II regions, seenebula: Diffuse nebulae (H II regions).)\n\nInterstellar dust grains (seenebula: Interstellar dust) scatter and absorb starlight, with the effect being roughly inversely proportional to wavelength from the infrared to the near ultraviolet. As a result, stellar spectra tend to be reddened. Absorption amounts typically to about one magnitude per kiloparsec but varies considerably in different directions. Some dusty regions contain silicate materials, identified by a broad absorption feature around a wavelength of 10 \u03bcm. Other prominent spectral features in the infrared range have been sometimes, but not conclusively, attributed to graphite grains and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.\n\nStarlight often shows a small degree of polarization (a few percent), with the effect increasing with stellar distance. This is attributed to the scattering of the starlight from dust grains that have been partially aligned in a weak interstellar magnetic field. The strength of this field is estimated to be a few microgauss, very close to the strength inferred from observations of nonthermal cosmic radio noise. This radio background has been identified as synchrotron radiation, emitted by cosmic-ray electrons traveling at nearly the speed of light and moving along curved paths in the interstellar magnetic field. The spectrum of the cosmic radio noise is close to what is calculated on the basis of measurements of the cosmic rays near Earth.\n\nCosmic rays constitute another component of the interstellar medium. Cosmic rays that are detected in the vicinity of Earth comprise high-speed nuclei and electrons. Individual particle energies, expressed in electron volts (eV; 1 eV = 1.6 \u00d7 10\u221212 erg), range with decreasing numbers from about 106 eV to more than 1020 eV. Among the nuclei, hydrogen nuclei are the most plentiful at 86 percent, helium nuclei next at 13 percent, and all other nuclei together at about 1 percent. Electrons are about 2 percent as abundant as the nuclear component. (The relative numbers of different nuclei vary somewhat with kinetic energy, while the electron proportion is strongly energy-dependent.)\n\nA minority of cosmic rays detected in Earth's vicinity are produced in the Sun, especially at times of increased solar activity (as indicated by sunspots and solar flares). The origin of galactic cosmic rays has not yet been conclusively identified, but they are thought to be produced in stellar processes such as supernova explosions, perhaps with additional acceleration occurring in the interstellar regions. (For additional information on interstellar matter, seeMilky Way Galaxy: The general interstellar medium.)\n\nThe central region of the Milky Way Galaxy is so heavily obscured by dust that direct observation has become possible only with the development of astronomy at nonvisual wavelengths\u2014namely, radio, infrared, and, more recently, X-ray and gamma-ray wavelengths. Together, these observations have revealed a nuclear region of intense activity, with a large number of separate sources of emission and a great deal of dust. Detection of gamma-ray emission at a line energy of 511,000 eV, which corresponds to the annihilation of electrons and positrons (the antimatter counterpart of electrons), along with radio mapping of a region no more than 20 AU across, points to a very compact and energetic source, designated Sagittarius A*, at the centre of the galaxy (seeSagittarius A). Sagittarius A* is a supermassive black hole with a mass equivalent to 4,310,000 Suns"}
{"text": "Molecules\n\nCourse: AST 871, Fall 2009 School: National Taiwan University Rating:\n\nWord Count: 12337\n\nDocument Preview). The Copernicus satellite detected Far-UV absorption bands of H2 (the Lyman & Werner electronic transition bands) and HD in the early 1970s, and Lyman FUSE (launched in 1999) has detected diffuse H2 along nearly every line of sight it has looked (where it often gets in the way of lines from the extragalactic sources of interest to the observations!). Infrared observations beginning in the 1970s detected H2 in emission from forbidden rotational-vibrational transitions in the Near-IR, with advances in IR array detectors in the late 1990s greatly expanding studies of these transitions. It was in the 1980s, with the development of new millimeter receiver technology, that the study of interstellar molecules blossomed. Many molecular species were identified, and the field has grown sufficiently in depth that we can only give it the most basic treatment here. This section will focus on the basic physics of molecular line formation in the interstellar medium, and on the properties of giant molecular clouds. These notes assume a familiarity with basic molecular structure (electronic, vibrational, and rotational quantum states) as was covered in the Astronomy 823 course (Theoretical Spectroscopy). Persons using these notes outside of OSU can refer to standard texts (like Herzberg) for the necessary background information. While the dominant molecular species in the ISM is H2, because it is a homonuclear linear molecule with no permanent dipole moment all of the low-lying energy levels are quadrupole transitions with small transition probabilities (A-values) and relatively high excitation energies. The high excitation energies mean that these transitions are only excited at high temperatures or in strong UV radiation fields (i.e., fluorescence). Thus the most abundant molecule in the ISM, carrying most of the mass and playing a key role in excitation, thermal balance, and gas-phase chemistry, is virtually invisible to direct observation. As a consequence, most of what we know about interstellar molecules comes from observations of socalled tracer species, primarily CO which is observed in its J=10 rotational transition at =2.6 mm. This and other molecular species are observed as emission lines from pure rotational transitions at centimeter to millimeter wavelengths. Like we saw in the case with the HI 21-cm line, we must account for stimulated emission as well as collisional and radiative effects when deriving the line properties. Since the formation of molecular species like CO occurs under conditions favorable for H2 formation, we will try to estimate the amount of H2 from the observed amount of CO with the assistance of a few simplifying assumptions. A final aspect of the physics of molecular clouds is chemistry, both gas-phase and on the surfaces of dust grains. This is a rich topic that is sadly beyond the scope of this course.\nV-1\nInterstellar Molecules\nSpectrum of Orion Molecular Cloud 1 (OMC1) in the 1.3mm band [Blake et al. 1987, ApJ, 315, 621] showing many of the 29 molecular species detected in this region.\nV-1 Interstellar CO & Other Tracer Molecules\nRadiative Transfer (yet again!)\nIn our discussion of the HI 21cm line our treatment of radiative transfer included the effects of stimulated emission. We were assisted in this analysis by the fact that the 21cm wavelength of the transition is in the long wavelength Rayleigh-Jeans limit of the background radiation field. For the rotational transitions of interstellar molecules like CO1 that occur at shorter wavelengths, this simplifying assumption is no longer true the analysis become more involved. In general, the background radiation field has a blackbody spectrum:\n2h 3 1 I = B (TR ) = 2 h / kTR 1 c e\nwhere TR is the brightness temperature of the background radiation field, which at millimeter wavelengths (e.g., for the CO J=10 transition at 2.6mm) is dominated by the cosmic microwave background radiation with TR2.725K. We know from COBE and WMAP observations that the cosmic microwave background is the most perfect blackbody yet observed.\nI will follow the usual convention of denoting the principal isotopic species of atoms in a molecule without giving the atomic weights explicitly. For example, CO means 12C16O. The isotopic species will be given explicitly when comparing different isotopic forms (e.g., when discussing the 12CO/13CO ratio in the standard CO analysis). V-2\n1\nInterstellar Molecules\nAt millimeter wavelengths, the observed brightness temperature of a line Tb is often expressed in terms of an effective antenna temperature:\n* TA = TA /\nwhere is the receiver efficiency. A molecular line source is usually observed by chopping the telescopes beam between on- and off-source positions and measuring the difference in antenna temperatures. In general, the difference in brightness temperatures is\n* TA = (1 e )\nh 1 1 e h / kTexc 1 e h / kTR 1 k\nThe excitation temperature Texc for a given transition is defined as: nu gu h ul / kTexc =e nl gl For pure rotational transitions the excitation temperature is often called the rotation temperature, whereas for vibrational transitions it is called the vibration temperature. This nomenclature is analogous to the spin temperature defined for the HI 21cm hyperfine transition. The absorption optical depth is:\n= ds = (nl Blu nu Bul ) I ds\nOn the right-hand side the first expression of the integrand is the pure absorption term, and the second is the stimulated emission term. Integrating the optical depth over the line profile and eliminating the Bs as we did previously in our treatment of atomic gas line transfer gives\nh ul c2 ( Nl Blu Nu Bul ) = 2 Aul Nu eh / kTexc 1 8 ul c line where Nu is the column density of the molecules in the given upper excited state, and Aul is the transition probability for the line. There are three regimes of excitation temperature:\nd =\n(\n)\n* Texc = TR : TA = 0; no line is visible * Texc > TR : TA > 0; line appears in emission * Texc < TR : TA < 0; line appears in absorption\nThe excitation temperature will depend on the relative importance of radiative processes (which drive Texc towards TR) and collisional processes (which drive Texc towards the kinetic temperature of the gas). Collisions between the molecular species in question (CO etc.) and HI and/or H2 are the most important. Considering only a single collider for simplicity, the excitation temperature is: 1 Aul + Tkin nqul 1 = Texc Aul 1 + nq ul where: T* = h ul / k and nqul = collisional de-excitation rate TR 1 T* TR TR T*\nV-3\nInterstellar Molecules\nWritten this way, the excitation temperature is a harmonic mean between the radiation and kinetic temperatures weighted by the relative collisional and radiative de-excitation terms. The ratio of the radiative and collisional rates is just the ratio of the density to the critical density for the transition: A ncrit = ul qul as we have seen previously for UV, optical, and near-infrared forbidden lines. In the low-density limit (n < ncrit), the excitation temperature is driven towards the radiation temperature and no line will be visible. In the high-density limit (n>>ncrit), the excitation temperature is driven towards the kinetic temperature, and we see an emission line since Tkin > TR for most cases.\nCritical Density and Line Visibility\nAt low densities, below the critical density, the excitation temperature will be only slightly above the radiation temperature and the emission line will be practically invisible. This is why you often read in the molecular line literature that a particular line is only visible at or above its critical density. At high densities, well above the critical density, the excitation temperature is at (or very near) the kinetic temperature of the gas, we often say that the line is thermalized. Because different molecular lines have different critical densities, line visibility can serve as an approximate density diagnostic. This rule of thumb is not without qualifications. Previously we noted that the weighting factor in the harmonic mean was the ratio of the density to the critical density. However, note that in the equation for 1/Texc, this factor is multiplied by an additional factor of (TR/T). If stimulated emission is important, T<<TR, and the density must be much larger than ncrit to produce visible emission lines. For example, the graph below shows the excitation temperature as a function of density for two molecular lines: the CS J=32 147 GHz line and the NH3 (J,K)=(1,1) 23 GHz line. This CS line has a critical density of 1.5106 cm3, and reaches an excitation temperature of 0.9Tkin at n=2106 cm3. However, the NH3 line has a critical density of 2103 cm3, but the excitation temperature does not approach the kinetic temperature until n>105 cm3, nearly 3 orders of magnitude larger. The reason is the greater importance of stimulated emission at low frequencies compared to at high frequencies. In general, if T=h/k<<Tkin, the density must be much larger than the critical density in order for the line to be visible. As such, the density must be very large compared to the critical density to thermalize lines at centimeter wavelengths (like the NH3 transition noted above), while at millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths, the lines of species like CO and CS are essentially thermalized at or near their critical densities. By the time you get to Infrared and Visible wavelengths stimulated emission becomes negligible and all collisionally excited lines thermalize at ncrit.\nTexc vs. density for NH3 and CS transitions from Evans (1989)\nV-4\nInterstellar Molecules\nTotal Column Densities\nOnce the total optical depth and kinetic temperature have been measured, this only gives an estimate the column density for molecules in that particular rotational state. To convert this into a total column density, we can exploit the fact that in order for the line is visible at all it must be nearly thermalized. In the LTE approximation, the fractional population of a given rotational state, J, is given as:\ng J e EJ / kT Q(T ) where Q(T) is the partition function, defined as the sum over rotational states. fJ =\nQ(T ) = gi e Ei / kT\ni\nFor rotational states in simple linear molecules like CO or CS, the statistical weights and energies of the Jth rotational state is: g J = (2 J + 1) EJ = J ( J + 1)hB (v) Here B(v) is a function of the moment of inertia associated with vibrational quantum number v of the molecule (rotational transitions come in ladders within a given vibrational state) B (v) = h 8 I (v)\n2\nwhere I(v) is the moment of inertia of the molecule when it is in vibrational quantum state v. The summation is relatively straightforward to perform as it can be truncated at a high J level because transition probabilities increase with increasing J, and transitions out of these higher states occur fast enough that they will be heavily depopulated and contribute negligibly to the partition function. At low density, the sum for Q(T) can be approximated as an integral:\nQ(T ) (2 J + 1)e EJ / kT dJ As the system approaches LTE, the partition function is approximately Q (T ) kT hB (v) For example, for the CO J=10 transition, the LTE partition function is: T Q(T ) 2.76 K Strictly speaking, LTE is not always a valid assumption, and explicit non-LTE calculations are performed to solve the equations of statistical equilibrium to evaluate the partition functions. When you see a conversion between the observed CO J=10 flux to a total CO column density being computed in the LTE approximation, you will know that theyve followed the simple treatment described above.\nRadiative Trapping\nThe preceding analysis has assumed that only photons from the background radiation field (TR) are used to compute the stimulated emission term, ignoring contributions from line photons. This assumption is only strictly true in an optically thin cloud. For strong lines in abundant molecular species, like the CO J=10 line, the cloud will be optically thick in these lines, and we will have to include stimulated emission from these emission-line photons in the radiative transfer treatment.\nV-5\nInterstellar Molecules\nIn an optically thick molecular cloud, line photons scatter around and are effectively \"trapped\". If the cloud is thick enough, the local density of line photons can greatly exceed the density of photons from the cosmic microwave background. These extra photons result in greater stimulated emission, driving the excitation temperature above the kinetic temperature of the gas. Further, the velocity field becomes important as we often observe that the widths of emission lines are larger than the expected thermal Doppler widths, either due to turbulent motions within the clouds or large-scale motions (e.g., velocity gradients or outflows). There are a number of ways to calculate the effects of radiative trapping, the most common is the escape probability treatment of Scoville & Solomon [1974, ApJ, 187, L67]. The details are beyond the scope of these notes, but the basic idea is that radiative trapping causes line photons to scatter many times about the cloud, enhancing the subsequent emergent line flux due to stimulated emission. Each emission-line photon emitted by normal downward radiative transitions can effectively multiply itself by stimulated emission before escaping the cloud. The result is that you can get a larger excitation temperature at a lower density than in an optically thin cloud, thus lowering the effective density at which the line appears to thermalize and become visible. Since CO J=10 line is always extremely optically thick in molecular clouds, some kind of radiative trapping treatment must be performed. For most Giant Molecular Clouds, the observed optical depths in the J=10 line are >10, lowering the effective density at which TexcTkin from 3000 cm3 to as low as 300 cm3.\nDensity & Temperature Diagnostics\nDensity Diagnostics\nThere are a variety of ways to estimate the density of a molecular cloud from observations of molecular lines, all of which come with various assumptions and caveats. Goldsmith gives a relatively complete list of the most common diagnostics in his review in Interstellar Processes along with citations to the key papers. The most basic way to estimate density is from the observed column density by assuming a path length through the cloud: n N tot L1 Ntot is the total column density along the line of sight, and L is the path length. A second way that is commonly encountered in the literature is to set lower limits on the density by noting which molecular lines of different critical densities are visible in a cloud. Some of the common emission lines (among many others) that are used in this way are: Transition\n12\nCO J=10\nFrequency 115 GHz 23.7 GHz 49 GHz 4.3 GHz\nncrit(10K) ~1000 cm3 1800 cm3 4.6104 cm3 1.7105 cm3\nNH3 (1,1) CS J=10 HCO+ J=10\nIf many lines from a given molecular species (e.g., H2CO) can be observed, a better method is to measure the ratios of lines that are not yet thermalized (n<ncrit). These line ratios will be density sensitive and may be used to estimate densities in roughly the same way that we used the [SII] and\nV-6\nInterstellar Molecules\n[OII] doublet ratios at visible wavelengths in HII regions. Such ratios tend to have limited ranges of applicability, for example: Lines CO J=10 and J=23 CS J=76 and J=43 Applicable Range 10 < n(H2) < 104 cm3\n2.5\n105.5 < n(H2) < 107.5 cm3\nThe main limitation of using molecular line ratios as a density diagnostic is that detailed quantum mechanical calculations are required to work out the density dependence, and this has been done for only a few species with the sufficient precision. A final way of estimating densities that is sometimes used to assume that the cloud is in virial equilibrium, with turbulent motions holding the cloud up against self gravity. Interpreting the observed line width as the virial velocity, you estimate the virial mass and divide by the volume of the cloud to estimate a density. Crude, but it can give a robust mean density for the cloud.\nTemperature Diagnostics\nThe most important thermometers in molecular clouds are the rotational transitions of 12CO. The low-J levels are very optically thick, and if the lines are thermalized, measuring the line strength gives the excitation temperature, and hence the kinetic temperature of the H2. In most molecular clouds without additional heating sources (i.e., away from regions of massive-star formation), the observed kinetic temperatures are in the range of 1020K. In these regions, the thermal balance is between heating by cosmic rays and collisions with warm (T=3040K) dust grains, and cooling by molecular line emission, with CO as one of the primary coolants. Near the edges of molecular clouds, heating by photoelectrons ejected by Interstellar Radiation Field photons becomes important. In clouds associated with massive-star formation (e.g., in Orion or M17), the cloud temperatures range from 4070K, and localized regions with heating sources can be as warm as a few 100K. For a few molecular line species, we can estimate the kinetic temperature directly, along with an estimate of the density, using line ratios of optically thin transitions. Emission lines of NH3, for example, are often used this way, in conjunction with detailed models. Again, the principal limitation of line ratio methods is the necessity of having using quantum mechanical models to predict the run of line ratios with density and temperature. Such data are known with sufficient precision for only a few molecular species.\nAnomalous Excitation\nBriefly, but not to diminish its importance, the complex quantum structure of molecules makes many of them susceptible to a variety of non-thermal excitation sources like radiative and collisional pumping. This can lead to anomalous under- or over-population of excited states if the combination of selection rules and transition probabilities works out just right. If a molecule can be pumped so that the population of an excited state greatly exceeds the population of the ground state (population inversion), the excitation temperature can greatly exceed the background radiation temperature, and the additional population of the excited state enhances the effect of stimulated emission. Under the right circumstances, this can lead to the production of an astrophysical maser or laser (in laboratory spectroscopy, you get a maser if the wavelength is longer than 1mm, and a laser if shorter than 1mm). The most common astrophysical masers are OH, H2O, and NH3 masers powered by either radiative or collisional pumping. These masers are usually\nV-7\nInterstellar Molecules\nassociated with regions of star formation, and in dusty outflows around AGB stars. This is an entirely separate field of endeavor beyond the scope of these notes, but the interested reader should consult Moshe Elitzurs review article in Interstellar Processes, or recent Annual Reviews articles on astrophysical masers. If the anomalous excitation leads to significant underpopulation of an upper level relative to the lower level of a molecular transition, the resulting excitation temperature can become lower than the background temperature, causing the line to appear in absorption as against the cosmic background. An example of this is the anomalous absorption seen in formaldehyde (H2CO), in which the upper level of the transition in question is depopulated by photon pumping into even higher levels. Collisional refrigeration mechanisms have also been proposed.\nThe Standard CO Analysis\nAs we saw before, the observed antenna temperature is (on-off) is: h * TA = (1 e ) [ f (Texc ) f (TR ) ] k where 1 f (T ) = h / kT e 1 Since the observed intensity depends on the excitation temperature, Texc, and the optical depth, , observations of a single line will not allow you to derive both [i.e., you have two unknowns but only one observable].\nBecause the energy of a rotational transition E(J) is inversely proportional to the moment of inertia of the molecule I(v), changes in the isotopic species of one (or both) atoms will change the line frequency sufficiently to distinguish the two isotopic forms. For the CO molecule, the isotopic ratio is 13 12 C/ C1/90, so that one expects the relative optical depth in the 13CO lines to be smaller than in the 12 CO lines. This expectation is at the heart of the standard CO analysis: in most cases the 12CO line is optically thick, while its isotopic partner 13CO is optically thin. Observations show that the typical relative brightnesses of the J=10 line is I(13CO)/I(12CO)~0.050.4, in agreement with this expectation. A further assumption is that 13CO and 12CO both arise in the same regions, and so share the same excitation temperature. If there are significant chemical fractionation effects, this assumption could be invalid (e.g., if local chemistry affects the creation/destruction of 13CO differently than that of 12CO). In the limit of large optical depth for the 12CO line, the excitation temperature is\nh k h k ln 1 + * 12 TA ( CO) + TR Inserting the numbers for the J=10 line (h/k=5.53K): Texc =\nTexc = 5.53 K 5.53 K ln 1 + * 12 TA ( CO) + TR\n12\nHere\n* TA = observed effective line intensity of\nCO\nTR = background radiation field temperature (2.725K)\nV-8\nInterstellar Molecules\nFor 13CO, we assume that it is optically thin, and substitute in the Texc derived from the 12CO observations into the equation for the intensity of 13CO and solve for the optical depth in 13CO, (13CO). Because we expect that Texc>TR, the optical depth of the 13CO line is\nT * ( 13 CO) ( CO) ln 1 A 12 * TA ( CO) Otherwise, we would have to solve the equations using the full form for the effective antenna temperature, which would need to be done numerically.\n13\n1\nThe optical depth in 13CO is then converted into a column density as follows: dv 1 e 5.53/Texc The integral is taken over the line profile expressed as a function of line-of-sight velocity v. This column density is often written as N(13CO), as one assumes that if the line is visible it must therefore be thermalized, and so TexcTkin and N is thus an LTE column density. N ( CO) = 2.85 10 cm\n13 14 2\n( 13 CO) [1 + Texc ]\nN(12CO) is then derived by assuming an isotopic ratio for 13CO/12CO, usually the locally determined cosmic ratio of ~1/90.\nV-9\nInterstellar Molecules\nV-2 Molecular Hydrogen (H2)\nMolecular Hydrogen (H2) is the most abundant molecular species in the ISM, and plays a crucial role in cooling and molecular chemistry. Despite its importance, it is also the most difficult species to observe directly. The reason is that H2 is a simple, homonuclear molecule. Because it consists of two atoms of identical mass, the center of mass and the center of charge coincide, resulting in no permanent dipole moment. With no dipole moment, only quadrupole rotational transitions can occur. This means that only the J=0 and J=2 rotational transitions occur, while the J=1 (dipole) rotational transitions are strictly forbidden. This means that unlike other molecules we have studied, H2 emits no lines long-wavelength rotational lines. The small mass and small size of the H2 molecule gives it a low moment of inertia. This means that the first pure rotational transition, J=20, occurs at 28m, a part of the spectrum unobservable from the ground due to water-vapor absorption in the atmosphere. Further, h/k =514K for this transition, very large relative to typical temperatures in giant molecular clouds (1020K). The next pure rotational transition is J=42 at 12m, which has h/k 1200 K. The generally high energies of the first excited states of H2 means that we expect negligible H2 emission unless we are looking at unusually warm (500-1000K) H2 gas in proximity to hot stars or in regions of active star formation within or at the fringes of giant molecular clouds. Contrast this situation with the CO J=10 line at =2.6mm where h/k=5.53K and the molecule, which is easily excited by H2 or HI collisions at temperatures of T=1020K more typical of the cores of giant molecular clouds. In general, H2 is only directly observable as 1. Absorption at Far-UV wavelengths in the diffuse ISM along sight lines toward nearby stars in the Lyman and Werner band electronic transitions. These lines arise in both cold and warm H2. This is our only direct probe of the cold H2 gas that makes up most of the ISM. 2. Emission by Infrared rotational-vibrational transitions in the electronic ground state of H2 at wavelengths between 1 and 28m in relatively warm regions. The molecular gas must be warm (500-2000K), excited either by shocks, outflows, or UV fluorescence from nearby stars. We will examine each of these below.\nUV Lyman & Werner Bands\nH2 consists of 2 hydrogen atoms linked by a covalent bond (i.e., sharing electron pairs between the atoms). The lowest energy states of H2 are shown in the figure below from Field, Somerville, & Dressler [1966, ARAA, 4, 207]. Subject to the usual selection rules for permitted electronic transitions (=0,1; S=0) and symmetry constraints on H2, there are two sets of allowed transitions out of the H2 ground state:\nLyman Bands: E>11.2eV, <1108 (first band head)\n+ X 1 + B 1 u g\nWerner Bands: E>12.3eV, <1008 (first band head)\nX 1 + C 1 u g\nExcitation into higher electronic states of H2 requires photons with wavelengths shortward of 800. Since these photons are more likely to ionize HI (<912), these higher electronic transitions are generally suppressed. A complete list of transition probabilities and oscillator strengths for these\nV-10\nInterstellar Molecules\nbands is given by Morton & Dinerstein 1976 [ApJ, 204, 1]. In all, the Lyman and Werner bands arising from the J=07 rotational levels in the ground vibrational state comprise nearly 400 absorption lines between 912 and 1120. An analogous set of HD (Deuterated Molecular Hydrogen) bands, shifted in wavelength, are also observed in this part of the spectrum. These, together with the HI and DI Lyman-series absorption lines, are potentially powerful diagnostics of atomic and molecular Hydrogen in the diffuse interstellar medium, a potential which until recently has gone unrealized.\nElectronic states of H2, from Field, Somerville & Dressler (1966)\nThe electronic absorption bands of H2 occur in the Far-UV part of the spectrum inaccessible with either IUE or HST. Interstellar Lyman and Werner bands were first observed with the Copernicus satellite in 1974 (cf. Spitzer & Jenkins 1975, ARAA, 13, 133). Copernicus had very low sensitivity and could only detect these bands along relatively diffuse (e.g., AV<1) lines of sight (e.g., towards Puppis), although it did provide exceptional data. Later short-duration missions (IMAPS and ORFEUS) in the 1990s used small telescopes and their observations of the H2 bands were limited to bright stars with relatively low line-of-sight extinction, and only a few targets due to their short mission times. Sounding rockets were used to study specific targets for very brief times. This all changed with the launch of the FUSE satellite in June 1999. FUSE is ~105 times more sensitive than Copernicus in the Far-UV band, and has produced must of the best data on the H2 Lyman and Werner band absorption to date. This sensitivity has also allowed extension of these observations to so-called translucent line of sight, those with AV>1 mag (e.g., Snow et al. 2000, ApJ, 538, L65, Rachford et al. 2001, ApJ, 555, 839 & 2002, ApJ, 577, 221). This particular study was one of the key projects for the FUSE mission.\nV-11\nInterstellar Molecules\nFUSE spectra of H2 Lyman/Werner absorption bands along a translucent line of sight [From Rachford et al. 2002]\nThese absorption lines are the only way at present to directly detect the cold H2 gas that makes up most of the ISM. The limitations of these bands as ISM diagnostics are the same as for the UV atomic absorption lines, namely that information is confined to particular lines of sight back lit by strong UV sources (e.g., OB stars or AGNs) with sufficiently low extinction that the UV light from the background source can be detected. However, because these absorption lines of H2 are so strong, the H2 Lyman/Werner bands have been seen along every line of sight where FUSE has observed, in fact they are often a foreground nuisance when observing extragalactic lines of sight, and in choosing targets one must take care not to pick sight lines where the strongest H2 lines are expected to be saturated, as the redshifted lines of interest in, for example, an AGN have been known to fall into these bands. The FUSE translucent cloud study produced direct measurements of the H2 column densities from the J=0 and J=1 transitions along lines of sight to more than 40 early-type stars with AV>1. Combined with earlier Copernicus data for diffuse lines of sight, the following general conclusions can be made: 1. The kinetic temperature of the H2 gas range between ~50100K, with a mean value around 70K. This temperature is uncorrelated with the amount extinction along a line of sight, but hotter H2 gas can be found among diffuse lines of sight (i.e., there is greater scatter in Tkin, extending to higher temperatures), with cooler temperatures prevailing in regions where the H2 column density becomes large enough for self shielding to become important. 2. The molecular fraction f H 2 = 2 N H 2 /(2 N H 2 + N HI ) is low (<104) for sight lines with\nE(BV)<0.08, then it increases abruptly to >0.01 because of the onset of self-shielding, and rises to as high as 0.8 with considerable scatter in translucent sight lines. Nowhere, however, does the molecular fraction get as large as 90% as expected by earlier theoretical models. 3. While there is no detailed correlation between the molecular fraction and color excess or RV, the available data show that f H 2 is well correlated with the density-sensitive fractional CN abundance, the width of the 2175 bump, and the slope of the far-UV extinction, and a\nV-12\nInterstellar Molecules\ngeneral trend for f H 2 to be anticorrelated with the kinetic temperature (hotter H2 gas has a smaller molecular fraction). The relations with temperature and density are unsurprising: colder, denser clouds are expected to have a higher molecular fraction. The H2 electronic bands can, in principle, be seen in emission from the radiative cascade that would follow absorption of photons in the Lyman- and Werner bands. This would be most observable near regions with strong UV fluorescent excitation of H2 (see below). In particular, there have been observations of emission-lines from high-lying Werner bands in the 1150-1950 region accessible with IUE by Witt et al. 1989 [ApJ, 336, L21] towards a cold molecular cloud (the reflection nebula IC63), and by Schwartz et al. towards warm H2 in Herbig-Haro objects (shocks associated with jetlike outflows from young stellar objects).\nNear-Infrared Vibrational Rotational Emission Lines\nWithin the electronic ground state of H2, all of the vibrational and rotational transitions are forbidden by the dipole selection rules. This means that the P- (J=1) and R- (J=+1) branches of H2 do not occur, but transitions in the O- (J=2), Q- (J=0), and S- (J=+2) branches can occur and are observed in the near- and mid-infrared. The first vibrational-rotational transition in the H2 ground state is the v=00S(0) transition, which is the J=20 transition at =28.2m. All other vibrational-rotational transitions in the ground state have increasing energy (and shorter ). Pure rotational lines (vu=vl) span the 3.4 to 28m region, while v=1 vibrational-rotational transitions have typical energies of ~0.5eV and are found in the 14m region clustering around 2m. Typical transition probabilities are ~107 108 sec1, so these lines are strongly forbidden.\nISO spectrum of Orion H2 Peak 1 from 2-40m showing a wealth of H2 vibrational and rotational emission lines [Rosenthal et al. 2000, A&A, 356, 705]\nThe notation used for these lines is: vu vl O(J l ); for J= 2 vu vl Q(J l ); for J=0 vu vl S(J l ); for J= + 2\nV-13\nInterstellar Molecules\nFor example, the 10S(1) emission line at =2.1218m in the Near-IR arises from a transition between the (v,J)=(1,3) upper level and the (v,J)=(0,1) lower level in the electronic ground state of H2. H2 has two spin isomers: Para-Hydrogen with the proton spins anti-parallel, corresponding to the even-numbered J states, and Ortho-Hydrogen with the proton spins parallel, corresponding to oddnumbered J states. The ortho-to-para ratio is 3.0 for thermalized level populations (75% ortho-H2 and 25% para-H2). Because only J=0,2 radiative transitions can occur, radiative transitions between the various rotational-vibrational levels in the ground state will preserve the ortho- or parastate of the molecules, and so one speaks of separate ortho and para energy ladders within the ground electronic state. Deviations from the predicted ortho-to-para ratio of 3 are primarily caused radiative de-excitation from the excited Lyman- or Werner-bands into ortho or para ladders in the ground state, and thus observations of different ortho-to-para ratios is taken as a sign of fluorescent excitation by UV photons. Because the rotational-vibrational states have typical transition energies of 0.5eV, they require excitation temperatures of ~1000 K. Since the kinetic temperature of typical cold molecular clouds is at most a few 10s of Kelvins, this means that you will only see these lines in regions that are unusually energetic. There are three basic mechanisms for exciting the NIR rotational-vibrational emission lines of H2 in nebulae: 1. Collisional Excitation: This primarily affects the low-J levels of H2. Hydrodynamic shocks with velocities of >6 km/sec are the principal cause of strong collisional excitation, but if the velocity is >25 km/sec, the shock will destroy (dissociate) H2. 2. UV Fluorescence: Radiative excitation of the Lyman and Werner bands by UV photons is followed by radiative de-excitation into excited states of the ground level which pumps the populations of the excited states. 3. Formation Excitation: Excitation of low-lying states as a by-product of molecular formation on grains due to the redistribution of binding energy between heating of the grain surface, kinetic energy of the ejected molecule, and internal excitation of the newly-formed H2. We shall consider each of these in turn.\nCollisional Excitation\nH2 molecules are subject to collisions in a variety of astrophysical environments, particularly in regions with hydrodynamic shocks such as jets from young stellar objects, stellar winds impinging upon interstellar clouds, or shocks in supernova remnants. Because the first (v=1) vibrational excited state of H2 lies ~0.5eV above the ground state (corresponding to E/k6000K), temperatures above ~1000K are required to collisionally excite the low-lying vibrational levels of H2. Because the dissociation rate of H2 increases very rapidly with temperature, molecular gas hotter than 4000-5000K will either rapidly dissociate into HI or cool dramatically (H2 dissociation is a very efficient cooling mechanism). As such, most collisional excitation of H2 will occur for molecular gas in a very narrow range of a few thousand Kelvins. Models of shocks show that the excitation of the low-J states responsible for the observed rotationalvibration levels occurs if the shock speed is faster than ~6 km/sec, with an excitation efficiency that scales roughly like n0v3, where n0 is the pre-shock density and v is the shock speed. At shock speeds >25 km/sec, the shock heating results in dissociated into atomic Hydrogen, but one may still get excitation due to re-formation behind the shock as the post-shock gas and dust grains cool off.\nV-14\nInterstellar Molecules\nBecause of the narrow range of excitation temperatures between the lower threshold and the upper dissociation/cooling threshold, collisionally excited H2 is characterized by strong lines of low vibrational levels (v<4), with rapidly decreasing level populations with increasing energy levels. In the high-density limit where collisional excitation and de-excitation will dominate, the relative H2 vibrational-rotational level populations nv,J are characterized by a thermalized Boltzmann population:\nE exp v, J gJ kT where gJ is the statistical weight of the level, Ev,J is the energy of the upper level, and T is the kinetic temperature of the gas. For odd-numbered J-levels (ortho-H2), the statistical weight is:\nnv , J\ng J = 3(2 J + 1) while for the even-numbered J-levels (para-H2), the statistical weight is gJ = 2J +1 The standard analysis for the rotational-vibrational states of H2 is to create an Excitation Diagram that plots the emission line data as ln(nv,J/gJ) as a function of (Ev,J/k). The line strengths are usually expressed relative to a strong H2 line like the v=10S(1) 2.1218m line. If the level populations are thermalized, they will all lie along a straight-line locus in this diagram with a slope inversely proportional to the excitation temperature of the gas. An example excitation diagram for a collisionally excited region in the starburst galaxy NGC6240 is shown below.\nExcitation diagram for near-IR H2 lines in NGC6240 (unpublished OSIRIS data)\nIf a range of temperatures occurs along the line of sight (e.g., your sight line integrates through the cooling region behind a shock), the diagram will show a smoothly curving locus of points, with lower energy levels lying along a steeply sloped (lower T) curve, with more highly-excited levels lying along a flatter-sloped curve because these levels are only excited at higher temperatures. An example of this is shown below for the bright near-IR H2 peak in the Orion Molecular Cloud (OMC Peak 1) from Everett, DePoy & Pogge 1995 [AJ, 110, 1295]. The curves are fits assuming a power-law cooling function responsible for the range of temperatures observed. As advertised, the low-lying levels have a steeper slope (lower excitation temperature) than the high-lying levels (shallower slope, hence higher excitation temperature).\nV-15\nInterstellar Molecules\nExcitation Diagram for near-IR H2 emission lines in Orion H2 Peak 1 [Everett et al. 1995]\nAt lower densities, radiative de-excitation from excited rotational-vibrational states becomes important for determining the relative H2 level populations. Because each energy level has a different critical density, you to need specify both the density and temperature to estimate the equilibrium H2 populations. Such level populations will not be thermalized per se, and the temperature derived from the slope of the data in the excitation diagram is more correctly an excitation temperature rather than a reasonable approximation of the kinetic temperature. Which colliding species dominates (atoms or other molecules) determines the densities at which the observed relative level populations will deviate from the predicted high-density thermalized (nearLTE) populations. This is because each different collider has a different critical density associated with it. In purely molecular regions where H2-H2 collisions dominate, the critical densities are relatively high: 1056 cm3. In partially atomic gas, H0-H2 collisions begin to dominate when the atomic fraction is H0/H2>0.01 because the critical densities for H0-H2 collisions are about 2 order of magnitude lower than for H2-H2 collisions. In this case, the level populations will fall below the LTE predictions at densities of ~103 cm3. In either case, where a sufficient number of Near-IR H2 lines have been observed to make these subtle deviations evident, detailed level calculations are required to fully understand them (see Martin, Schwarz & Mandy 1996 ApJ, 461, 256, and Everett 1997, ApJ, 478, 246).\nFluorescent Excitation\nIn the interstellar medium, H2 in the electronic ground state can be excited into the first or second electronic excited states by absorption of a UV photon in the Lyman or Werner bands, respectively. Excitation is followed by radiative de-excitation back into the electronic ground state. On average, ~12% of the excited H2 molecules will de-excite into the dissociation bands (v>13) of the ground state, destroying the molecule (see below). The remaining, however, de-excite into bound levels of the ground electronic state which at low densities will cascade downwards into the v=0 level by radiative de-excitation through the forbidden rotational-vibrational transitions described before. At very high densities (>105 cm3, the critical densities of the rotational-vibrational states), the populations of these excited states can be redistributed by collisions before de-excitation into the v=0 level. Similarly at high UV flux densities multiple fluorescent excitations can redistribute the excited ground-level populations.\nV-16\nInterstellar Molecules\nIn addition to fluorescence by absorption of Far-UV continuum photons, the 12R(6) and 12P(5) transitions in the H2 Lyman band are in near-resonance with the HI Lyman- line at Doppler shifts of +15 and +100 km/sec respectively. Strong shocks can produce significant Lyman- emission, which in turn can fluorescently pump H2. This has been implicated as a possible source of warm H2 emission at the working surfaces of jets emerging from Young Stellar Objects (e.g., Wolfire & Knigl 1991 ApJ, 383, 205). Because the rotational state of the molecule changes very little during excitation and de-excitation (only J=0,2 transitions can occur), the rotational level populations will reflect the rotational state of the original gas being illuminated by UV radiation, whereas collisions can result in rotational mixing. In general, the spectral signatures of low-density fluorescent excitation of H2 are threefold: 1. Significant population of high-lying (v>4) vibrational levels that are rarely populated by collisions as they have sufficiently small Boltzmann factors that make these higher vibrational states relatively inaccessible. 2. Excitation temperatures for rotational states within a given vibrational level (rotation temperatures) are lower than the excitation temperatures among vibrational levels at a given rotational state (vibrational temperatures). In collisionally excited systems, rotational and vibrational temperatures are the same. The effect of this is to split the simple locus in the excitation diagram into separate curves by vibrational level. 3. The populations of even-numbered rotational states (para-H2) are enhanced relative to oddnumbered states (ortho-H2), in the sense that the observed ortho-to-para ratio will be smaller than the value of 3 expected for a thermalized population. An example of an excitation diagram for fluorescently-excited H2 gas in the reflection nebula NGC 7023 from Martini et al. 1997 [ApJ, 484, 296] is shown below.\nExcitation diagram of fluorescent H2 lines in NGC 7023 (adapted from Martini et al. 1997)\nThe effects of fluorescent excitation are most dramatic among the high vibrational levels (v=5, 6, and 7) that occur primarily in the 11.8m region (J and H-bands) and are unlikely to be significantly populated by collisions. The spectral signature of fluorescently excited H2 emission has been observed in reflection nebulae (Hayashi et al. 1985 MNRAS 215, 31P, Sellgren 1986 ApJ, 305, 399; Martini, Sellgren & Hora 1997, ApJ, 484, 296; Martini, Sellgren, & DePoy 1997, ApJ, 484, 296), and planetary nebulae (Dinerstein et al. 1988 ApJ 327, L27).\nV-17\nInterstellar Molecules\nThe signatures of fluorescent excitation, however, can be effectively erased at high densities when collisions start to become important. If the density is high enough (>1045 cm3), collisions can thermalize the level populations, resulting in excitation diagrams that more closely resemble shockheated H2, even when UV fluorescence is important. The effect of collisions is to quickly de-populate the high vibrational levels whose lines are usually an unambiguous signature of fluorescent excitation. The converse, however, does not occur: there is no convincing combination of effects that will cause a collisionally excited region to emit like a fluorescently excitation region. In any case, the detailed predictions of fluorescent excitation models depend sensitively on the density, temperature, UV radiation field intensity & spectrum, H2 formation/reformation processes etc. Classic fluorescent models are those of Black & van Dishoeck (1987 ApJ, 322, 412) and Draine & Bertoldi (1996, ApJ, 468, 269). These are the ones that are most often compared with observations.\nFormation Excitation\nH2 molecules form most efficiently on the surfaces of dust grains. Upon formation, the 4.5eV binding energy must be distributed into kinetic energy (after breaking the bond with the grain surface), heating of the dust grain at the formation site, and internal energy in the form of excitation of rotationalvibrational states within the electronic ground state. The exact distribution of energy depends on the details of formation that are fundamentally unknown, and so formation excitation is difficult to assess observationally. An example is higher-than-expected excitation temperatures in H2 Lyman-Werner bands observed in absorption towards stars (e.g., Spitzer & Zweibel 1974, ApJ, 191, L127). Some models have tried to include formation excitation in an ad-hoc way. For example the models of Black & van Dishoeck (1987) considered three different distribution functions in which (1) 1.5eV was distributed among the rotational-vibrational levels following the Boltzmann distribution, (2) all H2 molecules from in the v=14, J=0,1 levels, and (3) all H2 molecules form in the v=6 level with low-J states. These are then used as inputs in computing the emergent spectrum (see Black & van Dishoeck 1987 and Le Bourlot et al. 1995 ApJ, 449, 178 for examples).\nFormation of H2\nThere are two primary ways that H2 can be formed in the gas-phase. The first is Direct Radiative Attachment in which two H atoms collide to form H2 followed by radiation of the excess 4.5eV binding energy as photons:\nH 0 + H 0 H2 +\nAfter the H0-H0 collision the binding energy is converted into internal energy (excitation of rotationalvibrational levels of the ground state) in newly-formed H2 molecule. Because these transitions are highly forbidden, with small Einstein A coefficients, radiation of the binding energy very inefficient, and the molecule is much more likely to dissociate before it relaxes. The rate coefficient for radiative attachment is <1023 cm3 s1, so this mechanism is much too slow and inefficient to form H2 in sufficient quantities to be important in the ISM. Three-body processes, in which three H0 atoms collide and the third H0 atom carries off the excess binding energy, are similarly unlikely at ISM densities, though they have been proposed as a way to form H2 in protoplanetary disks. The second gas-phase mechanism is Associative Detachment, which was first proposed by McDowell [1961, The Observatory, 81, 240] and given its classic treatment by Dalgarno & McCray [1973, ApJ, 181, 95]. H 0 + e H + h\nH + H 0 H 2 + e\nV-18\nInterstellar Molecules\nThe first reaction, Radiative Association, is slow, having a temperature-dependent rate coefficient of ~1018 T cm3 s1. The second reaction, Associative Detachment, is much faster with a nearly temperature-independent rate coefficient of ~1.3109 cm3 s1, though this step will have to compete with photodissociation of H which has a rate of ~2.4107 s1 for diffuse clouds exposed to the ISRF. The combined volumetric H2 formation rate for this mechanism is approximately\ndnH 2 dt\nxe T n n cm 3 s 1 7.5 1023 4 H H 0 100K 1.4 10\nOverall, this mechanism is also very inefficient at forming H2 in the ISM, especially at low temperatures (though it is about an order of magnitude faster than direct radiative attachment). While too slow to explain the observed abundances of H2 in the present-day ISM, it may be important in the early universe when no metals, and hence no dust grains, were present, but the gas was hotter (larger T) and there were copious electrons present from partial ionization of H0 (larger xe) The currently favored H2 formation mechanism is Grain-Surface Catalysis, first described by McCrae & McNally [1960, MNRAS, 121, 238] and given its classic treatment by Gould & Salpeter [1963, ApJ, 138, 393]. An H atom colliding with a dust grain will have a certain probability of sticking to the surface, provided that it is not moving too fast (e.g., as in a hot HI gas) and that the grains themselves are not too hot, which makes the surfaces energetically less sticky. Once the H atom has been adsorbed by the grain surface, it will migrate around until it reaches a site on the grain surface where it is more tightly bound by either chemisorption (i.e., bound by valence forces with surface materials) or physisorption (i.e., bound by intermolecular van der Waals forces). Such sites act as sinks for H atoms. It is while trapped in this site that the atom is likely to encounter another H atom, and the two can react to form H2, distributing the 4.5eV of binding energy into (1) heating of the dust grain, (2) breaking the activation barrier at the formation site and ejecting the newly-formed H2 molecule from the surface (desorption), and (3) internal vibrational energy (excited ground states) that is later radiated away by the molecule as rotational-vibrational emission lines. The volumetric rate of dust-catalyzed H2 formation is given by:\ndnH 2 = Rd nH nH 0 dt where nH is the total density of hydrogen of all forms (nH=nH0+2nH2), nH0 is the density of neutral atomic hydrogen, and R is a rate coefficient with units of cm3 s1 that depends on the temperature of the atoms and grains and the fraction of atoms that can adhere to the grain:\n1 8kT Rd = m 2 H\n1/2\nda n\n1 dngr 2 a (a) H da\nHere (a) is the probability of sticking to a grain of size a. In general, it appears that all H atoms will stick to grains if their speeds are <2km/sec, provided that the grain temperatures are between ~20100K. If the grains are too hot, the adsorbed atoms will evaporate off the grain surface before they can find another H atom and form H2. From observations of the fraction of H2 towards nearby stars using Far-UV measurements of the Lyman-Werner bands, the H2 formation rate coefficient is estimated to be Rd131017 cm3 s1, implying a mean sticking fraction of 0.06 for typical interstellar conditions and the observed dust/gas ratio. Draine & Bertoldi [1996, ApJ, 468, 269] quote Rd=61018T1/2 cm3 s1. Thus while very small grains have most the total grain surface area, they are expected to be less effective as H2\nV-19\nInterstellar Molecules\nformation sites, and most molecular formation thus occurs on larger grains. In some sense this is not surprising, as the smaller the grain becomes, the longer the timescale between H-atom collisions. The H-atom impact timescale\na tHI 810 s 0.01m\n4\n2\nnH 30 cm3\n1\nT 100K\n1/ 2\nFor typical interstellar conditions, tHI is of order the photon absorption time. As we saw in the previous section on Dust, the absorption of a single photon by a small grain can cause rapid stochastic heating of the grain. Thus in the time it takes 2 H atoms to collide with and stick to a small grain it is very likely that a photon will be absorbed with enough energy to kick off the one or both of the hydrogen atoms, effectively suppressing H2 formation on tiny grains. Such photons have a less dramatic effect on the temperatures of large grains, and so photosuppression of H2 formation will be less effective. The corresponding timescale for H2 formation on grains, tH2 is:\nt H 2 109 nH1 years\nFor typical interstellar cold interstellar clouds where densities are of order 104 cm3 it is possible to convert most of the HI into H2 in as little as 105 years. Interstellar shocks may speed up this process by making the gas warmer and denser, provided the shocks are not so strong as to destroy the grains or the newly formed molecules. Some other important papers on H2 formation on grains are Hollenbach & Salpeter 1971 [ApJ, 163, 155] and Hollenbach & McKee 1979 [ApJS, 41, 555], and discussion in Draine & Bertoldi 1996 [ApJ, 468, 269].\nDestruction of H2 Molecules\nH2 molecules can be destroyed collisions and by UV photons (photodissociation). Collisional dissociation occurs at temperatures >4000 K, when collisions with HI can excite H2 into the unbound v>13 vibrational states. Photodissociation of H2 occurs when UV photons (either from a nearby star of the ISRF) are absorbed with sufficient energy to unbind the molecule. There are two possible processes for photodissociation:\nDirect Photodissociation from the electronic ground state: An H2 molecule in the X1g+ ground state should dissociate if it absorbs a photon with an energy >14.7eV (<850). The problem with this mechanism is that there are two processes competing for these photons. The first is HI ionization (threshold of 13.6eV, =912), which has a higher cross-section, so such photons are more likely to photoionize HI than dissociate H2. Second, the threshold for photoionization of H2 to H2+ out of the ground state is h>15.5eV (<804), which also has a larger cross-section than photodissociation. Thus while direct photodissociation can occur, it is very inefficient. UV Fluorescent Photodissociation This is a two-step process in which absorption of Lyman- or Werner-band UV photons is followed by radiative de-excitation into ground state vibrational continuum bands which have vibration quantum numbers v>13. These high vibrational levels are unbound and the molecule dissociates, converting binding energy into the kinetic energy of the now free H0 atoms. On average ~12% of all radiative decays following absorption in the Lyman- and Werner-bands\nV-20\nInterstellar Molecules\nresults in fluorescent dissociation of H2. This is the dominant mechanism for H2 photodissociation in the ISM. Classic papers describing these H2 destruction are Dalgarno & Roberge [1979, ApJ, 233, L25 for collisional dissociation] and Black & Dalgarno [1976, ApJ, 203, 132 for photodissociation]. The rate of photodissociation via Lyman/Werner band fluorescence is\ndiss = 4 J k d\nwhere 4J is the strength of the radiation field (e.g., the ISRF in the diffuse ISM), k is the fraction of Lyman/Werner band excitations that are followed by de-excitation into the vibrational continuum band and lead to dissociation of H2 (k0.12 for the ISRF), and is the cross-section for LymanWerner fluorescence\n= i i\ni\nwhere the sum is over all Lyman/Werner bands with h <13.6eV (i.e., absorptions arising from photons less energetic than the HI ionization potential). The rate of H2 destruction via this process is dnH 2 dt\n= diss nH 2\nIn the diffuse ISM, equilibrium between grain formation and fluorescent photodissociation occurs when Rd nH nH 0 diss nH 2 For typical values of the rate coefficients in the diffuse ISM, diss5.51011 s1, and so the fraction of H2 relative to Hydrogen of all forms in the diffuse ISM is roughly nH 2 nH\n1.1 107 T 1/2 nH\nIn the diffuse ISM, the time to achieve equilibrium should be of order 1/diss, which is ~600 years for typical conditions. We thus expect that in the diffuse ISM, the fractional abundance of H2 that we observe along virtually all sightlines is in equilibrium.\nSelf-Shielding\nAt H2 column densities >1014 cm2 the Lyman/Werner UV absorption line bands start to become optically thick, and H2 becomes self-shielding in the sense that all of the photons that could lead to UV fluorescent photodissociation are absorbed by H2 in the outer layers of the cloud, effectively shielding the H2 within it. The rate of H2 photodissociation thus depends on the abundance and state of excitation of the H2 as you go into the cloud. Self-shielding occurs in diffuse clouds exposed to the ISRF or in dense clouds in proximity to sources of UV photons (e.g., reflection nebulae around earlytype stars or HII regions and PNe). Dust can also absorb UV photons, further limiting the process, but as we will see it dominates only when the local UV radiation field is unusually intense relative to the density of the cloud. Self-shielding makes H2 a very robust molecule, allowing it to exist even in the UV radiation field of the diffuse ISM.\nV-21\nInterstellar Molecules\nThe H2 photodissociation rate in the presence of dust opacity and H2 self-shielding is\ndiss = 0e\ngr\nf shield ( N H 2 )\nwhere 0 is the dissociation rate at the cloud surface, gr is the dust grain optical depth, and fshield is the self-shielding factor, which Draine & Bertoldi [1996, ApJ, 468, 269] estimated as\n1 = N H 3/4 2 N0 for N H 2 < 1014 cm 2 for 1014 N H 2 < 1021 cm 2\nf shield\nBelow the threshold column density of N0=1014 cm2 there is no self-shielding, whereas above it selfshielding scales as the H2 column density to the 3/4 power. The strong dependence on column density means we expect there to be a very sharp-edged transition between atomic and molecular gas regions as we go into a molecular cloud, much in the same way that we saw an abrupt transition between ionized and neutral gas in HII regions. This can be seen as follows. In steady state, H2 destruction is balanced by H2 formation\ndiss nH = Rd nH nH\n2\n0\nAssuming low dust opacity and recalling that nH=nH0+2nH2, the steady-state density of H2 is\nnH 2\n3/4 0 N0 = nH + 2 3/4 Rd nH N H 2 1\nSince column density (N) and total density (n) are related by dN=n ds, we can rewrite this to solve for the approximate H2 column density: N H2 and the H2 abundance, XH2 X H2 = dN H 2 dN H R n N = 4 d H H 4 0 N 0\n4 3\nR n N = d H H N0 4 0 N 0\n4\n4\nThe result is that there is a very sharp transition between neutral atomic hydrogen (H0) and molecular hydrogen (H2) going into a region of steady-state photodissociation because of the effect of selfshielding. The mid-point of the transition will occur when the gas is half atomic and half molecular which occurs when XH2=1/4. This transition point occurs at a column density of N diss\nG 3.7 10 0 nH\n22\n4 /3\ncm 2\nwhere G0 is the mean intensity of the ISRF and taking Rd=31017 cm3 s1, the upper end of the range quoted above. Dust opacity starts to become important when A11001 hence NH21020 cm2. This means that the onset of H2 self-shielding will determine the location of the H2/H0 transition for (G0/n)<0.02 cm3, which is generally true of molecular clouds illuminated by the ISRF. Near OB starforming regions or reflection nebulae in proximity to UV-bright stars, however, (G0/n)~1 cm3, and dust opacity, not self-shielding, determines the location of the molecular/atomic transition which works out to be a depth where AV=2 going into the molecular cloud.\nV-22\nInterstellar Molecules\nV-3 Observed Properties of Molecular Clouds\nIn this section we will briefly review some of the properties of giant molecular clouds as derived primarily from observations of tracer molecules like CO. This is a research area that has become increasingly active as new and better millimeter techniques; especially millimeter interferometry and sub-millimeter imaging (e.g., SCUBA) have come into use. A thorough review of the current literature would be beyond the scope of this course, but this should give you an idea of some of the more common results quoted in recent and previous papers.\nCloud Structure\nLocal density estimates using line ratios often give larger densities than global mean densities found by averaging the observed molecular column densities along the line of sight. The interpretation of this is that the clouds are very clumpy, with the dense cores having typical sizes of <1 pc or smaller, and densities >106 cm3. The overall cloud itself extends for 320 pc on average, with a mean density of 1034 cm3. Some molecular clouds (most?) have a number of discernable cores. These are often detected as sources of molecular lines with high critical densities (e.g., CS), while the general cloud is mapped using lines of lower critical density (chiefly CO). Within the galaxies, molecular clouds are most often seen organized into complexes with sizes from 20 to 100pc, and overall H2 masses of 1046 Msun. The distinction between clouds and complexes in terms of sizes and masses is somewhat artificial. A more precise statement is that we see a wide range of structures, from single small clouds to large complexes of clouds, with many complexes arrayed along the spiral arms of the Galaxy.\nCloud Masses\nOne way to estimate the mass of a molecular cloud is to integrate the column density across the face of the cloud by mapping it with millimeter interferometry. A common alternative that is used is to assume that the cloud is only supported against its own gravity by internal thermal pressure. In this case the characteristic length scale within the cloud is the Jeans Length:\nkT RJ 2 Gn\n1\n2\nAssuming that the clouds are spherical, the mass will be the Jeans Mass: 4 3 RJ C 18M sunT 1.5 n 0.5 3 where T is the kinetic temperature in K, and n is the density in cm3. If the cloud is supported against gravity by random turbulent velocities with a characteristic velocity dispersion of v, you can define a Virial Mass for the cloud R M vir v 2 G Where R is the radius of the cloud, and v is the velocity dispersion of an optically thin emission line (e.g., the 13CO J=10 line). The assumption here is that the observed velocity dispersion is just the amount needed to virialize the cloud. Computation of a virial mass requires that you can resolve the cloud (measure R). A more sophisticated analysis assumes that the cloud has a radial density profile, rathe 871, Autumn 2008, Problem Set 3Due Thursday, October 30Problem 1 A radiation-bounded nebula is one in which all of the ionizing photons are absorbed within the ionized volume, and the ionization equilibrium is found by balancing the total\n\nNotes on the NotesThese lecture notes have been distilled from hand-written notes compiled while teaching Astronomy 871, Physics of the Interstellar Medium, during 4 quarters between 1993 and 1999, and recently revived for teaching it again during S\n\nI Introduction to the Interstellar MediumThe Interstellar Medium is anything not in starsDonald Osterbrock [1984 Jan 13 authors UCSC course notes].

{"text": "The phenomenon of black holes is one of the stranger consequences of General Relativity. The interest in these objects originates from two quite distinct perspectives.\n\nMassive black holes in context\n\nFrom the perspective of basic theoretical physics, black holes are essentially elementary macroscopic objects, since their internal structure is causally disconnected from us. They can be fully characterized by three ``quantum'' numbers: mass, angular momentum and electrical charge. Black holes serve as ``gedanken-laboratories'' in attempts to reconcile quantum mechanics and General Relativity (e.g. Hawking radiation) and to explore the fundamentals of statistical mechanics and information theory (e.g. black hole entropy). Such thought experiments frequently require a microscopic black hole, where quantum effects are significant, or an isolated black hole in vacuum, where adiabatically slow thermodynamic processes can occur. Unfortunately, Nature does not appear to provide us with such black holes. All black holes that have been discovered so far are very massive, and are surrounded by, and interacting strongly with a hot radiating plasma (which also neutralizes any electric charge they may have). Thus, there is little hope of making an experimental connection between actual black holes and these fundamental questions of interest.\n\nThe questions of interest from the astrophysical perspective are very different from those of the fundamental physics perspective. Two classes of black holes are known to exist. The first consists of stellar black holes of roughly 10solar masses, which emerge from the collapsing core of massive stars (>30 solar masses) that have exhausted their nuclear fuel. The second consists of super-massive black holes with masses in the range of 106to 109solar masses, which are found at the centers of galaxies, one in each galaxy. It is not exactly clear how super-massive black holes are formed. A third class of yet undiscovered intermediate mass black holes is also thought to exist. These may be the missing link between the stellar black holes and the super-massive ones. This web essay will focus on super-massive black holes, and specifically on the one in the center of our home galaxy, the Milky Way. Black holes play a wide range of roles in current astrophysical research.\n\nMassive black holes as extreme energy sources\n\nThe accretion of mass into black holes powers many astrophysical phenomena. It is a seeming paradox that black holes are in fact the most efficient persistent sources of energy in the universe (second in efficiency only to direct matter-antimatter annihilation). The source of the energy is the gravitational potential energy of the matter falling into the black hole. Since the matter reaches the speed of light as it crosses the event horizon (the ``edge'' of the black hole--the point of no return), its kinetic energy is of the order of its rest-mass energy. The effective friction of the inflowing gas on itself as it is squeezed into the small ``drain'' of the event horizon converts a significant fraction of the kinetic energy into radiation and energetic particles. Up to 42% of the gas rest-mass energy can be extracted until the gas finally reaches the point (close to the black hole but still outside the event horizon) where the orbits become unstable due to General relativistic effects and it plunges straight in and disappears forever inside the black hole. This high efficiency far exceeds the <1%efficiency of nuclear fusion that powers the Sun.\n\nThe more massive a black hole is, the faster it can accrete before the radiation pressure of the accretion luminosity becomes so high that it wins over gravity and blows the gas away. Therefore of all black holes, it is the super-massive ones that achieve the highest luminosities. The most spectacular persistent accretion-powered phenomenon in the universe are quasars, which are super-massive black holes in the centers of distant galaxies. Quasars produce so much light that they outshine their entire host galaxy (Figure1). Understanding the complex magneto-hydrodynamics of accretion flows and understanding why only a minority of massive black holes are luminous while the majority are dim is an important subfield of theoretical astrophysics.\n\nFigure 1:Left: A Hubble Space Telescope image of a disk of gas and dust in the inner 1000 light-years of active galaxy NGC4261. The gas is illuminated by an accreting massive black hole in the center. Right: The accretion also powers strong radio jets that extend well into intergalactic space.

See Hubble Space Telescope press release.\n\nMassive black holes, galactic dynamics and galaxy formation\n\nA super-massive black hole was found in every galactic center that was observed with high enough precision. It is now widely assumed that all galaxies contain one. The mass of the black hole is always about 0.1% of the mass of spheroidal component of the host galaxy (the galactic bulge in disk galaxies like our own, or the entire galaxy in elliptical galaxies like the one shown in Figure1) (Magorrian et al. 1998; H\u00e4ring and Rix 2004). This relation between the central black hole and its host galaxy suggests a causal connection between the formation of the two. However, the physical mechanism behind this correlation is still unknown. The connection likely involves the feedback effect of the intense radiation from the accreting black hole on the star-forming gas in the galaxy around it. Galaxies grow by successive collisions and mergers with other galaxies, and the massive black holes in them must also eventually merge, while somehow preserving the black hole--bulge correlation. There is at present little direct evidence that black holes mergers actually occur. The next generation of space-borne gravitational wave observatories will hopefully detect the energetic bursts of gravitational waves that are emitted in the course of such mergers.\n\nMassive black holes as astrophysical research tools\n\nIrrespective of the unanswered questions about the formation mechanisms of the massive black holes, or the physics of accretion, massive black holes can serve as tools to study various other astrophysical questions. Two well-established techniques use quasar light to trace the distribution of matter in the universe. In one technique quasars serve essentially as lamps in a ``shadow theater'', which illuminate from behind filaments of inter-galactic gas, the leftover material from the epoch of galaxy formation. The gas is detected then by the absorption features it imprints in the quasar's spectrum. A second technique probes the gravitational potential of intervening galaxies, clusters of galaxies and the dark matter associated with them by the effects of gravitational lensing, where gravity causes light rays to bend. As a result, instead of seeing the actual quasar, several distorted images of the quasar are observed. A massive black hole, specifically the Galactic one, can also serve as a tool for studying stellar physics and stellar dynamics, since it is essentially a ``stellar collider''. This is further discussed below.\n\nInfrared observations of the Galactic center\n\nLike all galaxies, the Milky Way harbors a massive black hole. It is the lowest mass black hole discovered to date, with ''only'' ~ 106 solar mass (Eisenhauer et al. 2005; Ghez et al. 2005), in keeping with the atypically small bulge of the Milky Way. Like central black holes in many other galaxies, the Galactic black hole is very dim. What makes this black hole unique is its proximity. It is about 100 times closer than the black hole in the nearest large galaxy, Andromeda, and about 2000 times closer than those in the galaxies of the nearest cluster of galaxies, the Virgo cluster. For this reason it is possible to observe the environment of the Galactic black hole at a level of detail that will not be possible for any other galaxy in the foreseeable future.\n\nFigure 2:Composite infrared image of the Milky Way and its center. Large scale: COBE/DIRBE satellite image (1.25, 2.2 and 3.5 micron). Small scale: a 2MASS survey (1.25 and 2.17 micron) image combined with one from the MSX/SPIRIT satellite (6-11 micron).\n\nThe first hint of its existence was provided by the discovery, 30 years ago, of the unusual radio source Sagittarius A (SgrA*) at the dynamical center of the Galaxy (Balick and Brown 1974). It took almost three decades to obtain decisive observational evidence that SgrA*is indeed a massive black hole. There were several reasons for the long wait. The faint radio luminosity of SgrA*could be easily explained in terms of other, less exotic alternatives. Accreting massive black holes typically emit most of their luminosity in the UV to soft X-ray range of the spectrum (the more massive the black hole, the less energetic the typical wavelength). However, most of this spectral range is not accessible to observations, since the line of sight to the Galactic center is completely opaque to optical to UV light (Figure2) due to the large amount of intervening interstellar dust (smog-like micron-sized particles made of graphite and silicates). To see anything, it is necessary to observe in either longer or shorter wavelengths. It is only recently that the Galactic black hole was observed in the IR (Genzel et al. 2003a) and X-ray (Baganoff et al. 2001) bands. Unfortunately, even these impressive observational achievements are insufficient determine the nature of SgrA*--the physics of accretion are still not understood well enough for the detection of this emission to be considered strong evidence of the existence of a black hole.\n\nFigure 3: Adaptive optics-assisted infrared images of the the central light year taken by the Very Large Telescope (Genzel et al., 2003a). The false colors correspond to temperature. Blue stars are hot and short-lived (therefore must be young). Red stars are old, less massive giant stars at the last stages of their lives. It should be emphasized that what seems to be the size of the stars is just an artifact due to light ``leaking'' around bright sources. At a distance of about 24000 light years all the stars are actually point-like sources well below the telescope's angular resolution.\n\nMost of the light emitted by the stars that orbit the black hole is also obscured by the inter-stellar dust. However, stars can be observed in the infrared, albeit with more difficulty (Figure3). Recent technological advances in infrared astronomy enabled deep and precise observations of these stars as they orbit the black hole (Eisenhauer et al. 2005; Ghez et al. 2005). It was these observations that finally delivered the most convincing evidence for the existence of the massive black hole. This is because the stars are clean, direct probes of the gravitational potential, whereas gas can be affected by other forces, such as radiation pressure, thermal pressure and magnetic fields.\n\nFigure 4: Stellar orbits around the massive black hole in the Galactic center, observed in the infrared (2.2 micron) with the Very large Telescope (Sch\u00f6del et al. 2002; Eisenhauer et al. 2005). The actual measurements (points with error bars) are shown only for the star named ``S2''. S2 has the shortest orbital period (15.2 years) of the stars detected to date. Its distance of closest approach to the black hole is only 17 light-hours, at which point it is traveling at almost 2% of the speed of light. For more information see MPE's Galactic Center web page.\n\nFigure4 shows the reconstructed orbits of several of the stars near SgrA*that were monitored over about a decade. The stars appear to be in orbit around an empty spot in space. The one star with the shortest period, S2, (15.2 yr) singly provided enough information to resolve several key questions about the mysterious dark mass in the center of the Galaxy (Figure5).\n\nFigure 5:\n\nWhat is the dark mass?\n\nor\n\n?\n\nWhere is the dark mass?\n\nHow far is the dark mass?\n\nWhat is the dark mass?\n\nCan it be a compact, but non-singular distribution of dark objects? Any spherical distribution of mass will affect the motions of the stars as if it were all concentrated in the center, as long as they do not pass through it. Possible candidates range from dark stellar objects: stellar black holes, neutron stars, white dwarfs or planets to particle dark matter, perhaps the same dark matter that is indirectly detected on cosmic scales. The good fit of the orbit of S2 to a Newtonian (Keplerian) orbit--a closed ellipse--implies that all the mass that is pulling on S2 (3.6 x 106solar masses, as derived from the orbital solution) is entirely enclosed inside the point of closest approach, 17 light-hours from the center. If it were not so, the orbit of S2 would have displayed signs of retrograde precession (rosette-like orbits) because the gravitational force on it would have deviated from exact r^-2 dependence. Such a tight upper limit on the volume containing the central mass rules out any dense cluster made of stellar mass objects on the grounds of dynamical stability (Maoz 1998). S2's orbit also rules out some elementary particle alternatives, such as the ``universal Fermi ball'', where all dark matter is explained by heavy fermionic particles, and where the central massive objects are in fact dense concentrations (``balls'') of fermions held against gravity by quantum degeneracy pressure (Munyaneza et al. 1998).The only remaining viable explanation for the dark central mass is that it is a black hole (Sch\u00f6del et al. 2002).\n\nWhere is the dark mass?\n\nUntil very recently there was no sign of accretion emission from the black hole in any other band apart for the radio. A blind search for the faint infrared emission that is expected to accompany the radio emission is very difficult because there are so many faint stars at the center. Stellar orbits can pinpoint the position of the black hole, since the measured projected acceleration vectors should all point to the central mass. The close proximity between the dynamically detected center of acceleration and the position of the recurrent infrared flares (Figure6) that were discovered a few years later was key evidence in confirming that the flares are indeed coming from an accreting massive black hole (Ghez et al. 2000).\n\nHow far is the dark mass?\n\nBecause we observe our Galaxy from the inside (Figure2), it is actually harder to reconstruct its structure than it is to reconstruct the structure of other galaxies seen from the outside. The distance of the solar system from the center of the Galaxy is a key parameter for Galactic cartography and for calibrating the luminosities of bright stars that can be used as ``standard candles'' to measure distances on cosmological scales. Stellar orbits can measure the distance to the MBH by a classical method long-used for measuring distances to binary stars (Salim and Gould 1999). The essence of the idea is that the motion of the star on the plane of the sky (the ``apparent motion'') is measured in terms of radians/year, whereas the line-of-sight velocity is measured via the Doppler shift of the stellar spectrum in terms of km/s. The orbital solution ties the angular and true velocities together through the distance to the black hole. The latest orbital determination fixes the distance to the Galactic center at 25000 +1000 light years (Eisenhauer et al. 2005).\n\nOne of the prime motivations for exploring the Galactic black hole is to observe General relativistic phenomena close to a super-massive object. The accretion luminosity is emitted by gas at distances only a few times larger than the event horizon (the strong-field limit). Not long after the center of acceleration was pinpointed, the black hole was finally revealed when it flared in the infrared (Figure6). Such flares are now known to be fairly frequent, occurring a few times per day, and typically lasting about an hour. It is thought that the flares are triggered by temporary peaks in the mass supply rate to the black hole, perhaps due to the presence of a denser than average clump of gas in the accretion flow. Two of these flares displayed an almost periodic fluctuation in their luminosity while the flare lasted (Figure7). The quasi-period of about 17 minutes is almost half as short as would be expected for gas orbiting at the last stable circular orbit of a 3.6 x 106 MO, non-spinning black hole. The black hole's spin affects the structure of space-time around it in a way that draws the last stable circular orbit closer and shortens its period. Thus, if indeed the flares arise from gas orbiting for a few periods close to the last stable orbit, and if the quasi-periodicity indeed reflects the orbital period, it is possible to translate the 17 minutes period to a lower limit the spin of the black hole, which must be spinning at half of its maximal possible value (Genzel et al. 2003a). This is not surprising; since the black hole absorbs the angular momentum of the matter that falls in it, it is expected to spin quite substantially. Thus, it is possible that the temporal structure of the flares is probing how space-time is twisted by the spinning black hole.\n\nFigure 6: First observed infrared (2.15 microns) flare from the Galactic black hole, as detected by the Very Large Telescope. The animation is looped: one cycle corresponds to half an hour (Genzel et al. 2003a). For more information see MPE's Galactic Center web page.\n\nFigure 7:A 17 minute quasi-period in the flux during an accretion flare, possibly originating in a hot clump of gas that orbits right at the last stable orbit for a few times before finally falling into the black hole. The period at the last stable orbit of a non-rotating black hole with the mass of the Galactic black hole is predicted by theory to be 27 minutes. The shorter 17 minutes period is explained by the fact that spacetime warps differently when the black spins, resulting in a smaller last stable orbit and a shorter orbital period. (Genzel et al. 2003a)\n\nTypical stars cannot approach the Galactic black hole as close as the emitting gas without being destroyed by the tidal field of the black hole. Thus, stars can mostly probe the weak-field limit of General relativity. Though less spectacular than the strong-field limit, stars orbiting a million solar mass class object at up to a few percents of the speed of light nevertheless probe a virtually unexplored regime of relativistic celestial mechanics. One effect that will be hopefully detected with continued monitoring is the slow-down of time near the black hole (gravitational red-shift), as expressed by the Doppler shift of the stellar spectra. This effect is substantially larger at the orbits' point of closest approach than it is on the surface of a white dwarf. Another effect that may be eventually detected is the advancing rosette-like orbits that are predicted by General Relativity (Figure7) as a consequence of the deviation from the Newtonian g-2 gravitational force law.\n\nFigure 8: A schematic comparison of a classical Newtonian orbit around a point central mass (red) and a General Relativistic one (blue). In Newtonian physics the gravitational force falls exactly as the distance squared, and the orbital ellipse closes on itself. Close enough to the central black hole General Relativistic effects deviating from Newton's law of gravitation cause the point of closest approach to advance, leading to a rosette-shaped orbit (blue).\n\nFigure 9: Gravito-hydrodynamic simulations of fast stellar collisions in the dense stellar cusp near a massive black hole. Left: two equal mass stars (orange) in a grazing collision are momentarily deformed and evaporate a few percents of their mass (yellow clouds). Right: A neutron star (blue) in a penetrating collision with a normal star.\n\nDynamical studies of the way stars respond to the growth and presence of a massive black hole in a galactic center all predict that the stellar density will grow toward the center and settle into a (formally) diverging, high density ``stellar cusp''. The observed stellar density near the black hole is about a billion times higher than near the Sun, and the stars move up to a 100 times faster relative to each other than they do elsewhere in the Galaxy (Alexander 1999; Genzel et al. 2003b). Such extreme and unique conditions effectively make the inner stellar cusp into a ``stellar collider'', where stellar properties can be probed when stars closely interact with each other or with the black hole. Many theoretical ideas involving stellar dynamics and stellar physics have been proposed to explain various aspects of the unusual stellar population that are observed near the Galactic black hole. The picture is still far from clear. We conclude this article by briefly mentioning just three of the many possible processes.\n\nTidal destruction\n\nStars that approach too close to the black hole are destroyed. They are either swallowed whole, or, as is more typical of the relatively small massive black hole in our Galaxy, first disrupted by the strong tidal field and then get accreted. Figure10 show a Gravito-hydrodynamic simulation of an extreme case of tidal disruption where the tidal ``squeeze'' raises the central density of the star by so much that the resulting accelerated nuclear reactions may cause the star to explode as a supernova (Carter and Luminet 1982).\n\nCollisional destruction\n\nPhysical star-star collisions (Figure9) are predicted to be frequent in the high-density cusp. Such destructive collisions may be responsible for the absence of bright, large giant stars in the very central region around the black hole (Figure3) (Alexander 1999).\n\nExchange interactions\n\nOne of the consequences of the steep gravitational potential around the black hole is ``mass segregation'', a dynamical process whereby massive stars tend to ``sink'' to the bottom of the potential well, whereas the light stars ``float'' out. As a consequence, the inner light-year of the Galaxy is expected to contain a large, dense cluster of stellar black holes (of about 10 MO). Such black holes may be responsible for the presence of young stars of about 10 MO very close to the black hole (S2 is one of them), by capturing there via the dynamical process of ``3-body exchange'' (Figure11), where the young star ``knocks out'' a stellar black hole of a similar mass and takes it's place (Alexander and Livio 2004).\n\nClick to see the animation in full size: Figure 10: A gravito-hydrodynamic simulation of an extreme tidal interaction between a star and a massive black hole, that may lead to a nuclear run-away and a supernova explosion. Top left: a view of the stellar trajectory (orange) around the black hole (red dot) from above the orbital plane. Top right: An edge-on view of the orbit. Note how the star (black blob) is squeezed into a two-dimensional pancake as it passes through the point of closest approach. Bottom: a plot of the changes in the central density as function of time. The higher the central density, the faster the nuclear reaction rate.\n\nFigure 11: A schematic depiction of a celestial billiards ball game. The orbit of a hot young star (blue dot following dashed trajectory) approaching close to the black hole (big central black dot) intersects with the tight orbit of a stellar mass black hole (small black dot following solid trajectory) of roughly the same mass. As a result of a 3-body exchange, the young star ``knocks'' the stellar black hole away (the interaction is gravitational--the two don't actually touch each other) and takes its place in a tight orbit very close to the massive black hole.\n\nThe Galactic black hole provides a uniquely accessible laboratory for studying in detail a massive black hole in its interactions with its environment: how it feeds and grows by accreting gas and stars and how the extreme density, high velocity and strong tidal fields affect the stars near it. The gas and stars probe the nature of the central dark mass and probe post-Newtonian gravity in the weak- and strong-field limits. These issues are relevant for understanding the massive black hole phenomenon in general. The wealth of observed phenomena near the Galactic black hole provides the impetus to study the physics of gas and stellar processes in such an extreme environment. These studies prove to be very fruitful, yielding valuable insights even in cases where they do not fully succeed to explain the observations (Alexander 2005). Many questions remain--the most exciting science still lies ahead.\n\nAbout the Author\n: Dr. Tal Alexander is a theoretical astrophysicist.

{"text": "Scientists have pieced together the key elements of a gamma-ray burst, from star death to dramatic black hole birth, thanks to a \"Rosetta stone\" found on March 29, 2003.\n\nThis telling March 29 burst in the constellation Leo, one of the brightest and closest on record, reveals for the first time that a gamma-ray burst and a supernova -- the two most energetic explosions known in the Universe -- occur simultaneously, a quick and powerful one-two punch.\n\nThe results appear in the June 19 issue of Nature. The burst was detected by NASA's High-Energy Transient Explorer (HETE) and observed in detail with the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope (VLT) at the Paranal Observatory in Chile.\n\n\"We've been waiting for this one for a long, long time,\" said Dr. Jens Hjorth, University of Copenhagen, lead author on one of three Nature letters. \"The March 29 burst contains all the missing information. It was created through the core collapse of a massive star.\"\n\nThe team said that the \"Rosetta stone\" burst also provides a lower limit on how energetic gamma-ray bursts truly are and rules out most theories concerning the origin of \"long bursts,\" lasting longer than two seconds.\n\nGamma-ray bursts temporarily outshine the entire Universe in gamma-ray light, packing the energy of over a million billion suns. Yet these explosions are fleeting -- lasting only seconds to minutes -- and occur randomly from all directions on the sky, making them difficult to study.\n\nA supernova is associated with the death of a star about eight times as massive as the Sun or more. Its core implodes, forming either a neutron star or (if there is enough mass) a black hole. The star's surface layers blast outward, forming the colorful patterns typical of supernova remnants. Scientists have suspected gamma-ray bursts and supernovae were related, but they have had little observational evidence, until March 29.\n\n\"The March 29 burst changes everything,\" said co-author Dr. Stan Woosley, University of California, Santa Cruz. \"With this missing link established, we know for certain that at least some gamma-ray bursts are produced when black holes, or perhaps very unusual neutron stars, are born inside massive stars. We can apply this knowledge to other burst observations.\"\n\nGRB 030329, named after its detection date, occurred relatively close, approximately 2 billion light years away (at redshift 0.1685). The burst lasted over 30 seconds. (\"Short bursts\" are less than 2 seconds long.) GRB 030329 is among the 0.2 percent brightest bursts ever recorded. Its afterglow lingered for weeks in lower-energy X-ray and visible light.\n\nWith the VLT, Hjorth and his colleagues uncovered evidence in the afterglow of a massive, rapidly expanding supernova shell, called a hypernova, at the same position and created at the same time as the afterglow. The following scenario emerged:\n\nA bluish Wolf-Rayet star -- containing about 10 solar masses worth of helium, oxygen and heavier elements -- rapidly depleted its fuel, triggering the Type Ic supernova / gamma-ray burst event. The core collapsed, without the star's outer part knowing. A black hole formed inside surrounded by a disk of accreting matter, and, within a few seconds, launched a jet of matter away from the black hole that ultimately made the gamma-ray burst.\n\nThe jet passed through the outer shell of the star and, in conjunction with vigorous winds of newly forged radioactive nickel-56 blowing off the disk inside, shattered the star. Meanwhile, collisions among pieces of the jet moving at different velocities, all very close to light speed, created the gamma-ray burst. This \"collapsar\" model, introduced by Woosley in 1993, best explains the observation of GRB 030329, as opposed to the \"supranova\" and \"merging neutron star\" models.\n\n\"This does not mean that the gamma-ray burst mystery is solved,\" Woosley said. \"We are confident that long bursts involve a core collapse, probably creating a black hole. We have convinced most skeptics. We cannot reach any conclusion yet, however, on what causes short gamma-ray bursts.\"\n\nShort bursts might be caused by neutron star mergers. A NASA-led international satellite named Swift, to be launched in January 2004, will \"swiftly\" locate gamma-ray bursts and may capture short-burst afterglows, which have yet to be detected.\n\nThe VLT is the world's most advanced optical telescope, comprising four 8.2-meter reflecting Unit Telescopes and, in the future, four moving 1.8-meter Auxiliary Telescopes for interferometry. HETE was built by MIT as a mission of opportunity under the NASA Explorer Program, with collaboration among U.S. universities, Los Alamos National Laboratory, and scientists and organizations in Brazil, France, India, Italy and Japan."}

Most of the elements heavier than iron are made by a process called neutron-capture nucleosynthesis.\n\n\"Although neutrons have no charge, they can decay into protons after they're in the nucleus, producing elements with larger atomic numbers. One of the ways that this method can work is by exposure to a burst of neutrons during the violent supernova death of a star. We call this process the rapid process (r-process). It can produce elements at the middle and bottom of the periodic table\u2014from zinc to uranium\u2014in the blink of an eye.\"\n\nRoederer, with co-author James Lawler, looked at an ultraviolet spectrum from the Hubble Space Telescope public archives to find arsenic and selenium in a 12 billion year-old halo star dubbed HD 160617.

In addition to arsenic and selenium, they found rarely seen cadmium, tellurium, and platinum, all of which were produced by the r-process. This is the first time these elements have been detected together outside the Solar System. Astronomers cannot replicate the r-process in any laboratory since the conditions are so extreme. The key to modeling the r-process relies on astronomical observations.\n\n\"What I find exciting is that arsenic and selenium can be found in other stars, even ones like HD 160617 that we've been studying for decades,\" remarked Roederer. \"Now that we know where to look, we can go back and study these elements in other stars.

Kalirai, an assistant astronomer at the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) in Baltimore, has developed a new technique for measuring the age of stars in the Milky Way's halo. The halo is the spherical space around the flatter disk of the galaxy, which contains dense clusters of stars called globular clusters and older stars.\n\nKalirai's technique makes use of newly formed white dwarf stars to determine the age of their parent stars in the halo to within 0.7 billion years. This is much more precise than the two other techniques available to measure stellar ages in the halo, which are accurate to between 1 and 3 billion years, depending on the technique.\n\nSo why do we want to know how old stars in the Milky Way's halo are? The more precisely astronomers can determine those stars' ages, the more precisely they can determine the age of the galaxy itself, which in turn informs the theories of our galaxy's formation and evolution"}
{"text": "Source of Space Fireworks Discovered\n\nAn infrared image of the region in the Scutum constellation where the massive star cluster containing the red supergiants (inset) was discovered. CREDIT: Don Figer et al./NASA/JPL-Caltech\n\nAstronomers have traced the source of mysterious high-energy X-rays and gamma rays in space to a little known star cluster in the Milky Way.\n\nThe cluster sits about 19,000 light-years away from Earth in the constellation Scutum. It contains about 20,000 stars, most of which are hot, young blue stars.\n\nAstronomers had known about the star cluster before, but it was only recently that they confirmed the number of stars it held.\n\nIn the late 1990's, several observatories detected very high-energy X-rays and gamma rays coming from the region but astronomers were uncertain about their source. It was thought the blasts might have originated from distant galaxies or from pulsating stars known as pulsars, which typically emit radio waves but can send out other wavelengths of energy as well.\n\nA team of researchers is now proposing that the blasts are the result of massive stars known as red supergiants in the cluster that exploded cataclysmically as supernovae.\n\nSupergiants\n\nSupporting their hypothesis is the presence of 14 red supergiants within the cluster. Red supergiants are massive stars at the ends of their lives that can bloat up to about 100 times their normal size before exploding.\n\nBecause the red supergiant phase for stars lasts only about half a million to a million years--very short in astronomical terms--only a few red supergiants have ever been seen. Supernovae are even more difficult to detect, because even though they are billions of times brighter than normal stars when they explode, they remain visible only for several weeks or months.\n\n\"This observation is a rare chance to study huge stars just before they explode,\" said Don Figer, an astronomer at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore who led the study. \"Normally, we don't get to see stars before they pop off.\"\n\nOnly about 200 red supergiants have been spotted in the Milky Way and these are typically scattered far apart, so finding more than a dozen clustered together is highly unusual. Previous to this discovery, the record-holder for the star cluster containing the most red supergiants was NGC 7419, which had five.\n\nStars that become red supergiants are typically between 6 million to 15 million years old and about 8 to 25 times more massive than our Sun.\n\n\"If a red supergiant were situated where our Sun is, it would envelop Jupiter,\" Figer said.\n\nBecause the red supergiants in this cluster are still relatively bright, Figer's team estimates that the star cluster is relatively young, between 8 and 10 million years old. The idea is that stars in the cluster have to be young enough for astronomers to see them before they go supernova, yet old enough for some of them to have evolved to the red supergiant phase in the first place.\n\nHiding place\n\nThe reason the cluster has been largely overlooked until now is because of the interstellar dust that blankets much of the Milky Way.\n\n\"This cluster isn't too far away but there's a certain amount of dust between us and it,\" Figer said. \"At optical wavelengths, the stars are so faint that no telescope can see them.\"\n\nBut using NASA's infrared Spitzer Space Telescope, the researchers were able to pierce through the dust cover and see the cluster in detail for the first time.\n\nThe cluster is the first in a survey of 130 potential massive star clusters in our galaxy that the team has targeted for study over the next five years.\n\nThe findings were presented last week at the 207th meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Washington, DC."}
{"text": "Microlensed stars in the Galactic bulge\n\nThe central regions of our Galaxy are dominated by the crowded stellar bulge. Although stars in the bulge are typically observed to be almost as abundant in metals as the sun, the bulge is generally considered to have been one of the earliest parts of the Galaxy to form.\n\nThis project is on microlensed stars in the Galactic bulge. Microlensing occurs when a \"lens\" object (typically a low-mass star) becomes closely aligned with a more distant \"source\" star, whose image it magnifies and brightens. In the case of the bulge, the source stars are dwarfs which become bright enough while they are being microlensed (typically for a couple of weeks) to allow high resolution spectroscopy. So far, about 48 examples have been observed in this way, and some of them appear to be quite young. This does not fit into the usual picture of an old bulge.\n\nThe geometry of microlensing suggests that at least some of these stars may lie in the Galactic disk, on the far side of the bulge. That would be more consistent with the young ages. The aim of this project is to use the best available models of the bulge and inner disk of the Galaxy to calculate where the microlensed dwarfs are most likely to be located - do they belong to the bulge, or do they preferentially lie in the disk on the far side of the bulge?"}

{"text": "This post is the fourth in a series that accompanies the publication of my book 'Gravity's Engines: How Bubble-Blowing Black Holes Rule Galaxies, Stars, and Life in the Cosmos' (Scientific American/FSG).\n\nTen years ago the universe was in trouble.\n\nOr rather, our puny human theories about the nature of all the stars and galaxies in the universe were in trouble. At this time we had managed to discover a number of remarkable things about our cosmic surroundings. We had detected minute non-uniformities in the remains of the primordial radiation field known as the cosmic microwave background, and we had ever more convincing evidence that normal matter \u2013 the stuff we are made of \u2013 amounts to barely a fifth of the total raw mass of the universe. The rest is dark matter, a shadowy stuff that seldom interacts particle-to-particle but is massive enough that its gravity dictates much of the motion of stars in galaxies and the colossal structures of galaxy clusters and superclusters.\n\nA virtual cosmos. The predicted distribution of stars and galaxies across tens of millions of light years (Credit: Millenium Simulation)\n\nArmed with these observations, and with our models of how these features would translate into the seeding and gravitational growth of structure in the universe, we could build virtual realities in which galaxies and stars would arise and populate an imaginary cosmos. These simulations could then be compared to our great cosmological maps and our statistical counts of all the bright and dark places around us. It was a way to confirm our ideas, compare virtual universes to the real one. And this was the problem, because most of these models did not look quite like the real thing.\n\nThe fact was that the simulations overproduced stars and they overproduced big bright galaxies. They didn't produce a cosmos that looked like ours. Debate raged over the possible cause. It was possible that the computer algorithms used to simulate the production of stars in the virtual galaxies were deeply flawed. It was also possible that we were missing a critical component, a source of additional energy that would dampen down the process in the real universe, stunting galaxies and regulating stellar births from virtual nebula. But what could it be? It might be the energy of the stars themselves \u2013 massive suns burning through their nuclear fuel quickly and exploding as supernova could impose a speed-limit on the formation of subsequent generations. It might also be something else that was lurking in the dark alleys and back rooms of the cosmos.\n\nSupermassive black holes had long been suspected of being a disruptive element. As I wrote in the last piece in this series, when they consume matter they can be incredibly noisy, casting energy back out into the surrounding universe. Inside clusters of galaxies we see them blowing bubbles and generating waves in intergalactic gas, phenomena that slow down the condensation of that gas into cool nebula and new stars. In other places we see the wash of radiation and particles flooding galaxies, a sporadic but potent force. It looked like a promising solution, but was still incomplete.\n\nI was personally convinced of the role that these giant holes play in 'pruning' galaxies and stars when my colleagues and I stumbled across a great clue in the deep cosmic past. For black holes to provide the missing link, they needed to have helped stunt the growth of the very largest galaxies. And that meant that they needed to have been involved from the very outset, something that was unconfirmed. Luckily, we had discovered just such a situation in a place some 12 billion light years away, in the early morning of galactic evolution.\n\nThe birth of a galaxy. An overlay of the X-ray light (blue) and ultraviolet light (red) coming from a system 12 billion years ago (with thanks to Wil van Breugel and Ian Smail)\n\nIt has a dreadfully boring name of 4C 41.17. A source of intense radio waves so far away that its light is stretched, redshifted, by a factor of 3.8 due to the expansion of the universe. Using the giant Keck telescope in Hawaii, a seven hour exposure allowed us to make an image of what was originally the ultraviolet light flooding from this system \u2013 revealing a tumultuous scene of gas ebbing and flowing. Deep infrared images also showed a colossal mass of star dust, 600 million times the mass of our Sun in carbon-rich grains, a fingerprint of an orgy of stellar birth and death. And then we used NASA's orbiting Chandra X-ray Observatory for 40 hours to gather the barest whisper of X-ray light, a total of only 150 twelve billion year-old photons. But this was all we needed, because they revealed the whole story.\n\nDeep inside this teenage galaxy was a supermassive black hole. As it consumed matter it was spewing forth electrons at close to the speed of light. As these particles sped away they were meeting the cosmic background radiation, primordial photons. But 12 billion years ago the universe was more compact, the background radiation was warmer than it is today, and so when these encounters happened the exchange of energy was far more efficient than it is today. Black hole accelerated electrons boosted primordial photons into X-rays, and the X-rays were penetrating through the murk of this youthful galaxy, modifying its production of new stars.\n\nIt was an exciting discovery. A vivid demonstration that we did indeed need black holes, that they were not mere bystanders in the game of cosmic evolution but central players, today, yesterday, and all the yesterdays before that.\n\nThe number of stars in the universe, and the very nature of the galaxies, owes an enormous debt to the behavior of these most extreme and fantastical of astrophysical phenomena. Ten years ago they helped solve part of a mystery, who knows what we'll learn about them next.\n\nThe whole story of our modern view of black holes is told in Gravity's Engines, available today!11 Comments\n\nCaleb \u2013 Nicely put! Is it correct to say then that supermassive black holes were removing material and energy from galaxies that would have otherwise resulted in the production of additional stars?\n\nAlso, perhaps you can explain how it was determined \"\u2026 that normal matter \u2013 the stuff we are made of \u2013 amounts to barely a fifth of the total raw mass of the universe\" and \"The rest is dark matter\u2026\" Was this proportion arrived at the amount of additional mass required to generally make galactic models produce their observed non-Keplerian rotation curves, or was is the amount necessary for cosmological simulations to produce some observed characteristic? Thanks in advance\u2026\n\nAuthor is attributing the missing mass of stars and galaxies when compared to simulations to the presence of super massive black holes at the center of galaxies. He is also stating that for the black holes to stunt the growth of galaxies, super massive black holes should be associated with the galaxies right from outset.\n\nIn support of above, he has presented a study of an intense radio source nicknamed 4c 41.17 located some 12 billion light years away from earth and having a mass of about 600 million solar masses. An object of such a supermass equivalent to 600 million solar masses should be either a super massive black hole or a highly dense condensed stellar object. This happened some 12 billion years ago.\n\nAge of universe is normally taken at 13.72 billion years. In view of this, a pertinent question which arises is how within a span of about 1.72 billion years ( 13.72- 12), a super massive black hole having mass as high as 600 million solar masses could have been formed?\nA black hole is normally considered the end stage of a massive stellar object when it exhausts all its fuel by burning.. Within this span of 1.72 billion years, all the intermediate stages in the formation of a super massive black hole having 600 million solar masses viz coalescing of a very massive nebula of gas, formation of star, burning of fuel, formation of black hole have to be completed. I request author and readers to join their heads to discuss and examine if the above long sequence in the formation of a supermassive BH having mass of 600 solar masses is realistic within a period of 1.72 billion years?\n\nSecondly, author is stating that electrons accelerated to very high speeds, due to presence of SMBH, boosted the primordial CMB photons to X-rays. These X-rays modified \u2014 stunted the growth of new star formation. This straightforward means around a supermassive BH, a large nos. of CMB photons in radio frequency were converted to X-ray frequencies and this conversion took place some 12 billion years ago. If this is true, it implies around the vicinity of such supermassive BH, intensity of CMB photons ( in radio range) should be either NIL or much lesser compared to other regions away from SMBH. I do not know if this aspect has been examined or not? As far as I know COBE and WIMP studies have indicated uniform pattern in the intensity of CMB photons in all the parts of sky.\n\nYou should at least check such easily available sources as Wikipedia before questioning others?\n\nThe are several theories as to how SMBHs form. See \n\"Currently, there appears to be a gap in the observed mass distribution of black holes. There are stellar-mass black holes, generated from collapsing stars, which range up to perhaps 33 solar masses. The minimal supermassive black hole is in the range of a hundred thousand solar masses. Between these regimes there appears to be a dearth of intermediate-mass black holes. Such a gap would suggest qualitatively different formation processes.\"\n\nAlso keep in mind that the mass-energy density of the early universe was necessarily greater than in more recent times. Exceedingly dense conditions might have affected the processes of accretion to either directly produce supermassive black holes or produce hypermassive stars that then produced supermassive black holes via hypernovae.\n\nI too have to wonder how electrons ejected from SMBHs ingesting galactic matter through the relativistic jets of active galactic nuclei could have directly increased the energy of primordial photons (as I understand, thought to have been originally emitted as infrared spectra, now redshifted to microwaves) to produce x-rays. See \n\nSince AGNs produce multi-waveband emissions (thought to depend on the observer's viewing angle of accelerated particles being ejected), I don't understand how the x-ray emissions of AGN could have anything to do with any direct interactions with CMD photons. I suspect the x-rays have everything to do with interactions between the ejected particles accelerated in relativistic jets from SMBHs and hydrogen gas in the dense early intergalactic medium\u2026\n\nYou seem uncertain of what had a mass of 600 million solar masses. You first seem to believe it is the entire galaxy 4C 41.17 (see your 2nd paragraph). You then believe the SMBH in 4C 41.17 has a mass of 600 million solar masses (see your 2nd, 3rd and 4th paragraphs).\n\nProf Scharf wrote, \"deep infrared images also showed a colossal mass of star dust, 600 million times the mass of our Sun in carbon-rich grains.\" IT'S DUST. The SBMH disrupts (i.e. slows down) the dust from condensing into new stars. That's the whole point.\n\nThen your 5th paragraph seems to show further misunderstandings about the \"uniformity\" of the CMB. The original photons were UV. The accelerated electrons from the SMBH boosted the UV photons into X-ray photons.\n\nPlease look at the image of the galaxy and read its caption. It shows exactly what you seem to believe doesn't exist (see your last sentence about \"uniform pattern in intensity of CMB photons\"). The image shows that around the SMBH (assumed to be in the center) is made up of x-rays where the periphery is UV.\n\nA methodical doubt from a lay in everything: the dark matter is all dark, as Pink Floyd said about the dark side of the moon, or some dark matter is not so dark? Dark matter is really dark, or just it's not illuminated? If it's illuminated: does it reflect some light, or it's so cold that even if it absorbed some energy it wouldn't reach any sate allowing us to detect it? How dense is this dark matter in the space between stars and galaxies? Has the dark matter any connection to the concept of ether that was annihilated by Michelson and Morley?. Nice weekend!\n\nYes, I had noted that Prof Scharf has mentioned that IR image had indicated a supermass of 600 million solar masses as star dust. But in the next para he has also indicated of a SMBH deep inside the galaxy probably at the center.\n\"Deep inside this teenage galaxy was a supermassive black hole. As it consumed matter it was spewing forth electrons at close to the speed of light.\"\n\nThe article does not indicates mass of SMBH but indicates it to be supermassive. It also indicates that electrons accelerated closer to speed of light boosted primordial CMB photons to X-energies\nSo my original question remains as such : How within a period of 1.72 billion years, a SMBH after completing a long chain of steps, was formed?\n\nHowever, no mention has been made of the origin of UV radiations. Probably, UV radiations might also have originated from boosting of primordial CMB photons by boosting from accelerated electrons but at lower speeds.\n\nPrimordial CMB photons had appeared some 380000 years after BB when temp. was about 3000 K. At that temp. CMB photons were in the IR energies which in the current universe have gone down to radio range at temp of about 2.725 K. As per the article, 12 billion years ago, primordial CMB photons around SMBH were boosted to X-ray energies and probably also UV radiations. It implies 12 billion years ago intensity of primordial photons which, before boosting to higher energies, were in IR or higher radio ranges, would have been drastically reduced. This effect should be visible in present universe also when we detect CMB photons in radio range.\n\nAbove implies that if the hypothesis of author is true, intensity of CMB photons ( in the radio frequencies) received from space around a SMBH should be drastically lower that intensity of CMB photons received from those parts of sky which are away from SMBH. I had indicated if this aspect has been examined or not? But I learn that COBE and WIMP studies have indicated a uniform pattern in the intensity of CMB photons in all parts of the sky.\n\nIt's all in writing for anyone to read. What you wrote is not consistent with what Prof Scharf wrote. You did not mention dust.\n\nThe population of very massive stars in the early universe was significant enough for SMBHs to form in 1.7 billion years. Red supergiants and hypergiants only have lifespans of a few million to 100 million years (the larger the star, the shorter its lifespan). The BH created by these stars then merge to form SMBHs (the early universe was much more dense).\n\nRegarding the CMB radiation, I believe you have misunderstood what is meant by \"uniform pattern.\" Uniform pattern is in reference to macro-scale not micro-scale. It just means that 'everything' looks the same in all directions. One part of the sky in not more dense (or intense) than other parts of the sky. It does't mean the absence of variation.\n\nThis is ludicrous to watch. There is obviously something basic that is wrong with the Standard Model. But every time it hits a wall, instead of reassessing what led them into the wall, physicists just dream up some new theory in hopes of getting their square peg to fit better in the round hole. Making up more and more stuff to cover up the unworkability of earlier theories is a doomed proposition, since the flaw is somewhere in the initial conditions.\nLike with String Theory, how many dimensions does it take to overcome our initial mistake? Zero, because it cannot be done.\n\nCaleb \u2013 you might be interested in a recent hypothesis of spiral arm formation that attributes their production by planar outflows from galactic SMBHs.

This Hubble image demonstrates why astronomers had a tough time spotting this small-fry galaxy: It is practically invisible. The image shows how the handful of stars from the sparse galaxy are virtually indistinguishable from the background. Residing 500 000 light-years from Earth, Leo IV is one of more than a dozen ultra-faint dwarf galaxies found lurking around our Milky Way galaxy. These galaxies are dominated by dark matter, an invisible substance that makes up the bulk of the Universe's mass. Credit: NASA, ESA, and T. Brown (STScI)\n\n(Phys.org) -- Astronomers have used\n\nAstronomers have puzzled over why some extremely faint dwarf galaxies spotted in our Milky Way galaxy's backyard contain so few stars. The galaxies are thought to be some of the tiniest, oldest, and most pristine galaxies in the Universe. They have been discovered over the past decade by astronomers using automated computer techniques to search through the images of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. But an international team of astronomers needed the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope to help solve the mystery of why these galaxies are starved of stars, and why so few of them have been found.\n\nHubble views of three of these small galaxies, the Hercules, Leo IV and Ursa Major dwarf galaxies, reveal that they all started forming stars more than 13 billion years ago -- and then abruptly stopped -- all in the first billion years after the Universe was born in the Big Bang. In fact, the extreme age of their stars is similar to Messier 92, the oldest known globular cluster in the Milky Way.\n\n\"These galaxies are all ancient and they're all the same age, so you know something came down like a guillotine and turned off the star formation at the same time in these galaxies,\" said Tom Brown of the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, USA, the study's leader. \"The most likely explanation is a process called reionisation.\"\n\nThese Hubble images show the dim, star-starved dwarf galaxy Leo IV. The image at left shows part of the galaxy, outlined by the white rectangular box. The box measures 83 light-years wide by 163 light-years long. The few stars in Leo IV are lost amid neighboring stars and distant galaxies. A close-up view of the background galaxies within the box is shown in the middle image. The image at right shows only the stars in Leo IV. The galaxy, which contains several thousand stars, is composed of sun-like stars, fainter, red dwarf stars, and some red giant stars brighter than the sun. Credit: NASA, ESA, and T. Brown (STScI)\n\nThe relic galaxies are evidence for a transitional phase in the early Universe that shut down star-making factories in tiny galaxies. This phase seems to coincide with the time when the first stars burned off a fog of cold hydrogen, a process called reionisation. In this period, which began in the first billion years after the Big Bang, radiation from the first stars knocked electrons off primeval hydrogen atoms, ionising the Universe's cool hydrogen gas.\n\nThe same radiation that sparked universal reionisation also appears to have squelched star-making activities in dwarf galaxies, such as those in Brown's study. The small irregular galaxies were born about 100 million years before reionisation began and had just started to churn out stars at that time. Roughly 2000 light-years wide, these galaxies are the lightweight cousins of the more luminous and higher-mass star-making dwarf galaxies near our Milky Way. Unlike their higher-mass relatives, the puny galaxies were not massive enough to shield themselves from the harsh ultraviolet light. What little gas they had was stripped away as the flood of ultraviolet light rushed through them. Their gas supply depleted, the galaxies could not make new stars.\n\nThe discovery could help explain the so-called \"missing satellite problem,\" where only a few dozen dwarf galaxies have been observed around the Milky Way while the computer simulations predict that thousands should exist. One possible explanation for the low number discovered to date is that there has been very little, or even no star formation in the smallest of these dwarf galaxies, leaving them virtually invisible.\n\nThese computer simulations show a swarm of dark matter clumps around our Milky Way galaxy. Some of the dark-matter concentrations are massive enough to spark star formation. Thousands of clumps of dark matter coexist with our Milky Way galaxy, shown in the center of the top panel. The green blobs in the middle panel are those dark-matter chunks massive enough to obtain gas from the intergalactic medium and trigger ongoing star formation, eventually creating dwarf galaxies. In the bottom panel, the red blobs are ultra-faint dwarf galaxies that stopped forming stars long ago. Credit: NASA, ESA, and T. Brown and J. Tumlinson (STScI)\n\nThe Sloan survey recently uncovered more than a dozen of these galaxies in our cosmic neighbourhood. These have very few stars -- only a few hundred or thousand -- but a great deal of dark matter, the underlying scaffolding upon which galaxies are built. Normal dwarf galaxies near the Milky Way contain 10 times more dark matter than the ordinary matter that makes up gas and stars, while in these so-called ultra-faint dwarf galaxies, dark matter outweighs ordinary matter by at least a factor of 100. Astronomers think the rest of the sky should contain dozens more of these ultra-faint dwarf galaxies with few stars, and the evidence for squelched star formation in the smallest of these dwarfs suggests that there may be still thousands more with essentially no stars at all.\n\n\"By measuring the star formation histories of the observed dwarfs, Hubble has supported the theoretical explanation for the paucity of such objects, according to which star formation in the smaller clumps would be shut down by reionisation,\" said Jason Tumlinson of the Space Telescope Science Institute, a member of the research team.\n\nThe results are published in the 1 July issue of The Astrophysical Journal Letters.

{"text": "Nova T Pyxidis\n\nFrom 1890 to 1967, a tiny star in the constellation Pyxis flared up five times -- an average of about once every 20 years. But it hasn't made a peep since. That's led astronomers to suggest that a future outburst could be a doozy -- the star could blast itself to bits as a supernova.\n\nThe star is known as Nova T Pyxidis. It's actually a system of two stars. One of them is a white dwarf -- the small, dead core of a star that was once like the Sun. The other is similar to the Sun.\n\nAlthough the white dwarf is tiny -- only about the size of Earth -- its gravity is extremely strong, so it pulls gas off the surface of its companion. Much of the gas forms a thin, hot disk around the white dwarf, but some of it slams into the surface. When enough gas builds up, it triggers a thermonuclear explosion known as a nova -- and that's what happened in the earlier flareups.\n\nBut a study by astronomers at Villanova says the white dwarf didn't get rid of all the extra gas in these blasts -- it's continuing to build up. The star is already near the limit for how massive a white dwarf can be. When enough extra gas piles up, it'll tip the white dwarf over the limit, and the star will incinerate itself as a supernova. For a while, it'll shine as brightly as all the other stars in the galaxy combined.\n\nThe Villanova study says that should happen fairly soon -- on the astronomical time scale: sometime in the next 10 million years"}

{"text": "A new paper by cosmic ray researcher Henrik Svensmark suggests that the abundance of diversity of biological life on Earth is closely correlated to our planet's proximity to supernovae.\n\nSvensmark, a professor of physics at the Center for Sun-Climate Research at the Danish Space Research Institute, revealed his work in a paper published by the Royal Astronomical Society.\n\nThe prof reconstructed the relative rate at which stars within 850 parsecs of our solar system went supernova over the past 510 million years, and compared it to geophysical and paleobiological records.\n\nHe concluded, poetically, that: \"...remarkable connections to the long-term histories of life and the carbon cycle have shown up unbidden. Biodiversity, CO2 and the carbon-13 (\u03b413C) isotope (a proxy for photosynthesis) all appear so highly sensitive to supernovae in our galactic neighbourhood that the biosphere seems to contain a reflection of the sky.\"\n\nWhen our solar system passes through one of the galaxy's rotating arms, it is brought closer to exploding supernovae, which increases the quantity of cosmic rays reaching Earth's atmosphere. The intense bombardment from a supernova may last around 1,000 years.\n\nSvensmark suggests climate, rather than mutation, accounts for the correlation. He posits that the Permo-Triassic Extinction Event, which saw the mass death of almost all sea life on Earth, was not caused by a comet or asteroid, but rather by a fall in cosmic ray bombardment. Where cosmic ray exposure spiked, there was a corresponding sudden and short-lived falls in sea level and brief glaciations, he asserted.\n\nEarlier work by astronomer Brian Fields had suggested Earth was within a supernova's \"kill radius\" \u2013 30 light years \u2013 a dozen times over 4.5 billion years.\n\nBonus link\n\nCOMMENTS\n\n\"Passes through\"\n\nThe galaxy's arms are density waves, and all the stars in the galactic disk periodically pass through them. The most everyday example of a density wave is when you are driving along a busy motorway and the traffic abruptly slows to a crawl or stand-still for no apparent reason. Viewed from space at night, it is actually possible to see waves of traffic density moving in the opposite direction to the traffic. Another example is density waves of Guiness moving through the head as it settles.\n\nRe: Supernovae effecting our planet ...\n\nWell, yes, it's quite possible that the shockwave from a supernova several billion years ago compressed a cloud of gas and dust in just the right way that it went on to form the solar system, and therefore Earth. A supernova is certainly responsible for the formation of that dust.\n\nInteresting Conclusion...\n\nin the \"layman's version\" link...\n\n\"A mark of a good hypothesis is that it looks better and better as time passes. With the triumph of plate tectonics, diehard opponents were left redfaced and blustering. In 1960 you'd not get a job in an American geology department if you believed in continental drift, but by 1970 you'd not get the job if you didn't. That's what a paradigm shift means in practice and it will happen sometime soon with cosmic rays in climate physics.\n\nPlate tectonics was never much of a political issue, except in the Communist bloc. There, the immobility of continents was doctrinally imposed by the Soviet Academy of Sciences. An analagous diehard doctrine in climate physics went global two decades ago, when the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change was conceived to insist that natural causes of climate change are minor compared with human impacts.\n\nDon't fret about the diehards. The glory of empirical science is this: no matter how many years, decades, or sometimes centuries it may take, in the end the story will come out right.\""}

{"text": "Gravitational waves that are 'sounds of the universe'\n\nOct 03, 2011\n\nThis is a simulation of matter ejected from a star merger. Credit: Stephan Rosswog\n\nEinstein wrote about them, and we're still looking for them -- gravitational waves, which are small ripples in the fabric of space-time, that many consider to be the sounds of our universe.\n\nJust as sound complements vision in our daily life, gravitational waves will complement our view of the universe taken by standard telescopes.\n\nAlbert Einstein predicted gravitational waves in 1918. Today, almost 100 years later, advanced gravitational wave detectors are being constructed in the US, Europe, Japan and Australia to search for them.\n\nWhile any motion produces gravitational waves, a signal loud enough to be detected requires the motion of huge masses at extreme velocities. The prime candidate sources are mergers of two neutron stars: two bodies, each with a mass comparable to the mass of our sun, spiraling around each other and merging at a velocity close to the speed of light.\n\nSuch events are rare, and take place once per hundreds of thousands of years per galaxy. Hence, to detect a signal within our lifetime the detectors must be sensitive enough to detect signals out to distances of a billion light years away from Earth. This poses an immense technological challenge. At such distances, the gravitational waves signal would sound like a faint knock on our door when a TV set is turned on and a phone rings at the same time.\n\nCompeting noise sources are numerous, ranging from seismic noise produce by tiny quakes or even a distant ocean wave. How can we know that we have detected a gravitational wave from space rather than a falling tree or a rambling truck?\n\nTherefore, astronomers have been looking for years for a potential electromagnetic light signal that would accompany or follow the gravitational waves. This signal would allow us to \"look through the peephole\" after hearing the faint knock on the door, and verify that indeed \"someone\" is there. In their new article just published in Nature, Prof. Tsvi Piran, Schwarzmann University Professor at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and Dr. Ehud Nakar from Tel Aviv University describe having found just that.\n\nThey noticed that surrounding interstellar material would slow debris ejected at velocities close to the speed of light during the merger of two neutron stars. Heat generated during this process would be radiated away as radio waves. The resulting strong radio flare would last a few months and would be detectable with current radio telescopes from a billion light years away.\n\nSearch after such a radio signal would certainly take place following a future detection, or even a tentative detection of gravitational waves. However, even before the advanced gravitational wave detectors become operational, as expected in 2015, radio astronomers are geared to looking for these unique flares.\n\nNakar and Piran point out in their article that an unidentified radio transient observed in 1987 by Bower et al. has all the characteristics of such a radio flare and may in fact have been the first direct detection of a neutron star binary merger in this way.\n\n(PhysOrg.com) -- Detectors in the US, Germany and Italy are lying in wait to gather evidence that would unveil one of Albert Einstein's last secrets: gravitational waves. Up to now, it has not been possible ...\n\nScientists at The Australian National University today joined a consortium of universities launching plans for a new observatory to detect a space phenomenon that has challenged physicists since it was first proposed by Einstein ...\n\nWith a recently announced $6.5 million grant over five years from the National Science Foundation (NSF), an international consortium of researchers and institutions hopes to find and use the galaxy's most precise pulsars ...\n\nTeamwork between gamma-ray and radio astronomers has produced a breakthrough in finding natural cosmic tools needed to make the first direct detections of the long-elusive gravitational waves predicted by Albert Einstein ...\n\n(PhysOrg.com) -- A pair of neutron stars spiraling toward each other until they merge in a violent explosion should produce detectable gravitational waves.

{"text": "We surmise that in the Milky Way Galaxy, there would be about 10^8 single M stars like our sun. However, we can't be sure as there are many globular clusters that contain stars much like our sun.\n\nMost stars in our galaxy are binary stars (and a few 3,4, and 5 star systems). Centauri for example is made of Proxima Centauri, Alpha Centauri, Beta Centauri, and Dista Centauri.

{"text": "Violent Merger\n\nFor the most part, the galaxy known as M85 is pretty ordinary. It's about the same size as our own galaxy, the Milky Way, but it consists mostly of old, small stars.\n\nA couple of years ago, though, M85 put on a bit of a show. Astronomers detected an explosion inside the galaxy -- perhaps the result of a merger between two of its stars.\n\nAt its brightest, the explosion produced several million times more energy than the Sun does. It slowly faded away, but it retained an \"afterglow\" in the infrared -- a form of energy that's produced by relatively cool objects.\n\nThe astronomers who discovered the star classified it as a Luminous Red Nova. They suggested that it formed when two fairly old, fairly small stars merged to form a single star. The merger triggered the explosion, blasting a cloud of debris into space. Over time, the expanding cloud of debris cooled and its atoms joined together to form tiny grains of dust. These grains produced the infrared afterglow.\n\nThe star seems to resemble several other explosions detected in recent years, so Luminous Red Novae could form a separate class of exploding stars. But many astronomers want to wait and see a few more of them before they open up a new category.\n\nM85 is a member of the Virgo Cluster of galaxies. The cluster is low in the east on March evenings, above and to the left of the bright star Spica, and climbs high across the sky later on. A small telescope reveals many of its galaxies"}
{"text": "A Semi-Educated Guess\n\nOn Wednesday, January 26th, NASA will hold a press conference to announce a new discovery by researchers using the Hubble Space Telescope. What might that announcement contain?\n\nThere are a few clues. NASA has said that \"Astronomers have pushed the Hubble Space Telescope to its limits and have seen further back in time than ever before.\" They have also given the names of the participants in the conference. I don't think I'll be going too far out on a limb to speculate about the nature of their discovery.\n\nGarth Illingworth and Rychard Bouwens investigate galaxies that are as far out as we can see. One of the most fundamental tenets of modern astronomy is that objects distant from us in space are equally distant from us in time. When we see objects that are billions of light years distant, we are seeing them as they were billions of years ago. A telescope is essentially a time machine, and very powerful ones like the Hubble can reach back to the very earliest epochs of the universe's 13.75 billion-year history. Dr. Bouwens has a very nice web site here talking about his work with these first galaxies.\n\nA very quick summary of some of those early epochs:\n\n\u2022 After the Big Bang, the expanding universe is so hot that its matter is ionized. Electrons are too energetic to settle down and combine with atomic nuclei, and these free electrons scatter light willy-nilly in all directions. As a result, the universe is opaque.\n\u2022 About 380,000 years after the Big Bang, the universe has cooled enough for electrons to recombine with nuclei to form neutral atoms (mostly hydrogen). Light is now free to move through space unimpeded, and the universe is now transparent. The light from this era of recombination is what we see as the cosmic microwave background radiation.\n\u2022 There follows a period known as the \"dark ages,\" because there is no source of light other than the fading cosmic background radiation. Over time, clumps of slightly denser matter grow and eventually become dense enough to ignite nuclear reactions at their cores\u2014the first stars are born. The time for this era of reionization is thought to be around 500 million years after the Big Bang, or to put it another way, when the universe was less than 4% of its current age.\n\nSo what am I betting on? It is that Drs. Illingworth and Bouwens have reached all the way back to this early era to see one of the very first galaxies, containing some of the very first stars. This would be a remarkable achievement, and would be possible only because of the newly refurbished Hubble instruments installed by Space Shuttle astronauts in 2009.\n\nThis is fascinating stuff, in many ways beyond the comprehension of a layman such as me. But if nothing else, it tells us that there is so much \"out there\" that we are still learning about \u2014 and that we must be open to all manner of revelations and explanations, not constrained by rigid, narrow \"beliefs\" like those that are held on Candler's Mountain and elsewhere\u2026."}

{"text": "A half-billion stars and galaxies from NASA's WISE mission revealed \u2014 many for first time\n\nA new atlas and catalog of the entire infrared sky with more than a half-billion stars, galaxies and other objects captured by NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) mission was unveiled by NASA Wednesday.\n\n\"Today WISE delivers the fruit of 14 years of effort to the astronomical community,\" said Edward L. (Ned) Wright, a UCLA professor of physics and astronomy and the mission's principal investigator, who began working on the mission in 1998.\n\nA 10-foot unmanned satellite weighing 1,400 pounds, WISE was launched into space on Dec. 14, 2009, and mapped the sky in 2010. Like a powerful set of night-vision goggles, WISE surveyed the cosmos with infrared detectors about 300 times more sensitive than those used in previous survey missions, said Wright, who holds UCLA's David Saxon Presidential Chair in Physics. WISE collected 15 trillion bytes of data and more than 2.7 million images taken at four infrared wavelengths of light \u2014 invisible to the unaided human eye \u2014 capturing everything from nearby asteroids to distant galaxies.\n\nThe individual WISE exposures have been combined into an atlas of more than 18,000 images and a catalog listing the infrared properties of more than 560 million objects found in the images. Most of the objects are stars and galaxies, with roughly equal numbers of each; many of them have never been seen before.\n\nWISE observations have already led to many discoveries, including elusive failed stars, or Y-dwarfs. Astronomers had been hunting for Y-dwarfs for more than a decade. Because they have been cooling since their formation, they do not shine in visible light and could not be spotted until WISE mapped the sky with its infrared vision. WISE has also found that there are significantly fewer mid-size near-Earth asteroids than astronomers had previously feared. With this data, now more than 90 percent of the largest of the asteroids have been identified.\n\nOne image released today shows a surprising view of an \"echo\" of infrared light surrounding an exploded star. The echo was etched in the clouds when a flash of light from the supernova explosion heated surrounding clouds. More discoveries are expected now that astronomers have access to the WISE images.\n\nIn another image, moving objects such as asteroids and comets were removed, but residuals of the planets Saturn, Jupiter, and Mars are visible as bright red spots off the plane of the galaxy at the 1 o'clock, 2 o'clock and 7 o'clock positions, respectively.\n\n\"With the release of the all-sky catalog and atlas, WISE joins the pantheon of great sky surveys that have led to so many remarkable discoveries about the universe,\" said Roc Cutri, who leads the WISE data processing and archiving effort at the Infrared and Processing Analysis Center at the California Institute of Technology.\n\nThe Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) manages and operates the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The mission was competitively selected under NASA's Explorers Program managed by the Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Maryland. The science instrument was built by the Space Dynamics Laboratory, Logan, Utah, and the spacecraft was built by Ball Aerospace & Technologies Corp., Boulder, Colo.

So is this really a finger of a giant that once lived in Egypt?The new cloud of water is enough to supply 28 galaxies with water.\n\nTruly, that is one swampy patch of intergalactic space.\n\nEqually stunning is the age of the water factory. The two teams of astrophysicists that found the quasar were looking out in space a distance of 12 billion light years. That means they were also looking back in time 12 billion years, to when the universe itself was just 1.6 billion years old. They were watching water being formed at the very start of the known universe, which is to say, water was one of the first substances formed, created in galactic volumes from the earliest time. Given water's creative power to shape geology, climate and biology, that's dramatic.\n\n\"It's another demonstration that water is pervasive throughout the universe, even at the very earliest times,\" says Matt Bradford, an astrophysicist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and leader of one of the teams that made the discovery. (The journal article reporting the discovery is titled, without drama, \"The Water Vapor Spectrum of APM 08279+5255: X-Ray Heating and Infrared Pumping over Hundreds of Parsecs.\")\n\nIt is not as if you'd have to wear foul-weather gear if you could visit this place in space, however. The distances are as mind-bogglingly large as the amount of water being created, so the water vapor is the finest mist\u2014300 trillion times less dense than the air in a typical room.\n\nAnd it's not as if this intergalactic water can be of any use to us here on Earth, of course, at least not in the immediate sense. Indeed, the discovery comes as a devastating drought across eastern Africa is endangering the lives of 10 million people in Somalia, Kenya, and Ethiopia. NASA's water discovery should be a reminder that if we have the sophistication to discover galaxies full of water 12 billion light years away, we should be able to save people just an ocean away from drought-induced starvation.\n\nThe NASA announcement is also a reminder how quickly our understanding of the universe is evolving and how much capacity for surprise nature still has for us. There's water on Mars, there's water jetting hundreds of miles into space from Enceladus, one of Saturn's moons, there are icebergs of water hidden in the polar craters of our own Moon. And now it turns out that a single quasar has the ability to manufacture galaxies full of water.\n\nBut it was only 40 years ago, in 1969, that scientists first confirmed that water existed anywhere besides Earth.\n\nI am a huge fan of all things Slenderman, and I also happen to be an avid writer.

The footprints were so called because some people believed that the footprints were the tracks of Satan, as they were allegedly made by a cloven hoof. Many theories have been put forward to explain the incident, and some aspects of its veracity have also been called into question traveled straight over, and footprints appeared on the tops of snow-covered roofs and high walls which lay in the footprints' path, as well as leading up to and exiting various drain pipes of as small as a four inch diameter.Am Fear Liath M\u00f2r also known as The Big Grey Man of Ben MacDhui or simply The Greyman) is the name of a presence or creature which is said to haunt the summit and passes of Ben Macdui, the highest peak of the Cairngorms and the second highest peak in Britain. It has been described as an extremely tall figure covered with short hair, or as an unseen presence that causes uneasy feelings in people who climb the mountain. Evidence of the existence of this creature is limited to various sightings and a few photographs of unusual footprints.\n\nIt was traditionally seen as a supernatural being, but Am Fear Liath M\u00f2r has been compared to the Yeti of the Himalaya and the Sasquatch or Bigfoot of North America. References to wild 'Greymen' in Scotland and similar creatures elsewhere in Europe, sometimes called Wudewas or 'Wood Men', date back to the 13th century, and are believed by some to represent relict hominids.\n\nIn 1925, the noted climber John Norman Collie recounted a terrifying experience he had endured while alone near the summit of Ben MacDhui some 35 years before. \"I began to think I heard something else than merely the noise of my own footsteps. For every few steps I took I heard a crunch, and then another crunch as if someone was walking after me but taking steps three or four times the length of my own.\" Collie was unable to make out the source of the noises because of mist, and continued \"\u2026 [as] the eerie crunch, crunch, sounded behind me, I was seized with terror and took to my heels, staggering blindly among the boulders for four or five miles.\" Other climbers have also reported similar experiences, many describing uncontrollable feelings of fear and panic, some actually seeing a huge grey figure behind them, and others only hearing sounds or even succumbing to inexplicable feelings of terror while in the area.\n\nIn the Matt Lamy book 100 Strangest Unexplained Mysteries, Lamy notes a sighting in the early 1990s in which three men caught sight of a bipedal creature with an eerie, inhuman face in a forest near Aberdeen. Several weeks later, whilst driving through the area at night, the creature appeared again and ran alongside their car even at speeds of 45 miles per hour, seemingly trying to enter the vehicle.\n\nSimilar panic responses have been reported in many North American Sasquatch encounters, and explanations involving infrasound or pheromones have been advanced. Cryptozoologist Karl Shuker has expressed belief that the creature is the guardian of an inter-dimensional portal in his 1997 book, The Unexplained. However, hallucinations and panic brought on by isolation and exhaustion, or an optical illusion similar to the Brocken spectre, are very plausible explanations for the Big Grey Man legend. A Brocken spectre, or 'glory', can occur in certain atmospheric conditions when the sun is at a particular angle. The subject's shadow can be cast onto low lying clouds around them, creating the illusion of a large shadowy humanoid figure. This is the most commonly advanced theory to explain the reported sightings.\n\nThe green children of Woolpit reportedly appeared in the village of Woolpit in Suffolk, England, some time in the 12th century, perhaps during the reign of King Stephen.

Eventually they learned to eat other food and lost their green pallor, but the boy was sickly and died soon after the children were baptized. The girl adjusted to her new life, but she was considered to be \"rather loose and wanton in her conduct\". After she learned to speak English the girl explained that she and her brother had come from St Martin's Land, an underground world whose inhabitants are green.\n\nIn February, 1948, distress calls were picked up by numerous ships near Indonesia,.

Light comes in many different forms, from low-energy radio waves and microwaves that we use to talk on our phones and cook our food, to higher energy visible light that let us see a beautiful painting and spot a fly ball against a cloudy sky, to even higher energy x-rays that the dentist uses to peer inside our teeth. For pure energy, gamma rays beat them all.\n\nOn April 27, the Fermi Gamma Ray Space Telescope and the Swift Telescope recorded a burst of gamma rays from a target 3.6 billion light years away. The burst was so powerful that it released more energy in a few seconds than our Sun will produce in ten billion years! Anyone near such a burst would be fried instantly \u2013 fortunately the light years between it and us protected us from that fate.\n\nWhat might cause such an enormous outpouring of energy? This is still a great mystery, but scientists believe gamma ray bursts are just one step in the process of a stellar explosion called a supernova. As an aging star uses up its fuel in a process called nuclear fusion, the weakening outward push of the star's light begins to lose a battle with gravity. The star's own enormous weight begins to crush its center into a black hole. As matter from the star falls toward the black hole, it is super-heated and emits an intense beam of gamma rays. These gamma rays fly away from the star's North and South poles and out into space.\n\nBut that's just the beginning. As the star continues its internal collapse, a rebound occurs (see the activity below*) and some of the star's outer material flies away in a giant explosion called a supernova. This supernova is so bright it can outshine an entire galaxy for a short time. It is this supernova that scientists hope to see next. If they do see a supernova in the same part of the sky, it will confirm that we do, indeed, understand a little bit about the details of how stars die.\n\nBut why should we care? What difference does it make that a star blew itself up so long ago and so far away? Look at your hand. Just below your skin flows a river of life-giving blood. At the heart of every blood cell is a molecule called hemoglobin, carrying oxygen to each of your cells. And at the heart of each hemoglobin molecule is a single atom of iron. That iron atom has not been around forever, but instead was born in a supernova explosion that itself occurred billions of years ago. Stars are the places that iron, carbon, oxygen, and almost all other elements are forged, and it is in supernovas that those elements are scattered throughout the universe. We are made of starstuff.\n\nKeep watching this blog for updates on the story; will the expected supernova show up? What will it teach us about the universe? Science is always moving forward; we are always learning more. What will we discover next?\n\n*You can recreate your own supernova explosion with nothing more than a tennis ball and a basketball. Hold the two balls apart from each other, the same height from the floor. When you drop them at the same moment, they hit the ground together. This shows that each falls at the same rate. Yet the basketball, being heavier, has much more momentum.\n\nNow stack the tennis ball on top of the basketball. Drop them again (be careful to keep the tennis ball right on top, or it may come back and hit you!). This time, the tennis ball goes flying skyward with surprising speed. This is like what happens in a supernova explosion, as the outer parts of the star collapse and bounce off the dense inner surface of the collapsing star. You just created a supernova1) The Earth isn't roundMaybe a better challenge, though, comes from Mt. Chimborazo in Peru. This mountain is shorter than Everest by almost 10,000 feet, but because it is on the Earth's equatorial bulge (see #1 above), the top of Mt. Chimborazo is actually over six thousand feet further from the Earth's center than the top of Everest. So if you start measuring from the center of the Earth, you'd find that the farthest point that is still on land isn't Everest, it's the top of Mt. Chimborazo.\n\n3) The oceans are really . . .\n\nHow deep are the oceans? Try this: get an ordinary piece of 8 \u00bd by 11 paper. Draw a map of the Pacific Ocean on the paper. Put Japan on the left side and California on the right. Now imagine the water in between. In order to create a scale model of the Pacific Ocean, how far below the paper would the water have to dip? Five inches? Ten? In fact, on this scale the depth of the Pacific Ocean is the thickness of the paper itself!\n\nWhen considered this way, the ocean waters (which are \"only\" a few miles deep in most places) barely cover the ocean floor, almost like puddles on a sidewalk after the rain. Our planet's oceans are much, much wider than they are deep.\n\n4) The Earth is fast!\n\nThe fastest humans ever were the astronauts on the Apollo missions. They traveled at speeds of up to 24,791 mph on the way back from the Moon. But that speed is in relation to the Earth, and we know the Earth itself is always moving around the Sun. How fast is the Earth's motion? Get ready \u2013 over 66,000 mph! So in that sense every one of us, every second of every day, is moving faster than the fastest of the Apollo astronauts. Don't even get me started on how fast the Sun is moving around the center of the galaxy, or how fast the galaxy . . . well, you get the point. We're moving fast!\n\n5) Everything is recycled\n\nWhile we occasionally receive visitors from space, most of the Earth's matter has been here for a very, very long time. In fact, in your body right now are molecules of water that once passed through the bladder of Aristotle, Joan of Arc, and even Fabio! Water (like many other materials) circulates around and around our planet, finding new uses again and again. This is because atoms (which make up everything) are very small. In fact, there are far more atoms in a single glass of water than there are glasses of water in all the oceans of the world. The Earth itself is the original recycler!\n\n6) Speaking of atoms in water\n\nDid you know that the oceans of the world contain around 20 million tons of gold? Of course, no one knows how to extract all that gold from seawater in a way that makes doing so worthwhile. The gold in the ocean is so dilute that only about one part in a trillion (that's 1/ 1,000,000,000,000th) of seawater is gold. For now, the gold will stay there. But just imagine . . .\n\n7) People are amazing\n\nOf all the incredible facts about our planet, the most amazing is probably this: our planet is home to a creature that can know and understand the world, and can use that understanding to make a difference. As far as we know, Earth is the only planet where matter has come to life, and has grown up to understand its world and itself. We are the eyes, ears, and consciousness of the Earth, and that's pretty spectacular. Happy Earth Day, everyone!\n\nAuthor\n\n]]>Mon, 22 Apr 2013 09:55:38 -0400For Carl: Three New Worlds in the Cosmos\n Carl: Three New Worlds in the CosmosWhen Cosmos aired, no one knew if even a single planet existed outside our Sun's little family. Could we be the only planetary system in the galaxy, or even the universe? Or were planets common, with many other stars sporting their own planetary systems? Might any other planets even support life? No one knew.\n\nBut Sagan knew that scientists would one day find out. He said to those students \u2013 and to me, \"By the time you are as old as I am now (Sagan was 45 at the time \u2013 coincidentally, just my age today), we should know for all the nearest stars whether they have planets . . . That will happen in your lifetime, and it will be the first time in the history of the world that anybody found out, really, if there are planets around other stars.\"\n\nCarl Sagan died in 1996, a time when we were just uncovering the first tantalizing hints of extra-solar planets. But Sagan's prediction was right on the money. Today, we know of hundreds of other planets. Most of them (because they're the easiest to find) are gas giants like Jupiter and larger, with no solid surface. And most of these are in tight orbits around their star, with soaring temperatures and little if any chance for our kind of life. But this week NASA announced the discovery of three planets nearly the size of Earth, in orbits nearly like our planet's orbit. It's the closest we've come yet to finding another Earth in the heavens.\n\nHow did we find these worlds?\n\n... the ways by which men arrive at knowledge of the celestial things are hardly less wonderful than the nature of these things themselves \u2014 Johannes Kepler\n\nOK, if you can get past the sexism in the quote above, you'll recognize one of the great truths about science, a truth that Sagan celebrated again and again in Cosmos. Yes, what we discover is wonderful, but at least as wonderful are the methods by which we tiny humans, armed with nothing but cleverness, imagination, and the tools we create, learn about our world.\n\nThe Kepler telescope (named after the same Johannes Kepler quoted above) is one of those amazing human-created tools. In orbit around the Earth, Kepler stares at one particular patch of sky without pause. Hold your hand out at arm's length. This is just about the size of the sky Kepler is watching. Within that patch, Kepler keeps track of the light from 100,000 stars, all at the same time.\n\nWhen one of those stars gets dimmer, by even a fraction of a percent, Kepler records the event. The dimming might be caused by a spot on the star or some other local phenomenon. Or it might be caused by a planet passing between Kepler and the star. If, sometime later, Kepler sees the same kind of dimming again, the odds that Kepler has found a planet grow greater. After three or even four such cycles, Kepler's scientists know they've spotted a planet.\n\nThis kind of science requires incredible patience. If a planet is in an Earth-like orbit, it will take around one Earth year to go around its star, so we'll see the dimming of its star only once every few hundred days. Kepler needs to remember each dimming event and then, a hundred days, or two hundred, or five hundred days later, catch that same event again, all the while watching and recording 100,000 other stars in the same way. It's a task a human could never accomplish alone. But with our amazing ability to mold and shape the raw materials of the world into useful tools, we can make visible that which had remained hidden since the cosmos was born.\n\nThese planets are for you, Carl. I wish you could've been around to see them. The device is a wearable robot that consists of a motorized frame and computer, which will be used to help paraplegics with upright mobility. It always amazes me how medical technology continues to help so many lives around the world!Here's what I found out from Steve:\n\nIt all comes down to one idea: the world is made of atoms. Atoms in air combine together to form molecules, mostly nitrogen molecules (made of two nitrogen atoms) and oxygen molecules (made of two oxygen atoms). When these molecules are warm, they move quickly and bounce off one another. When they're cooler, they slow down and don't bounce as much.\n\nIn colder air, then, the molecules can get closer together while in warmer air they're further apart. The more molecules, the heavier the air, so cold air is heavier than warm air. When cold air and warm air meet, the cold air pushes under the warm air, sending the warm air higher.\n\nAir isn't much good at absorbing heat from the Sun; instead, it gains heat from the ground. So when you push warm air up, it cools (think about the tops of mountains - it's cold up there!) As the warm air cools, water vapor turns to drops of liquid water, forming clouds. If the drops are big enough, they fall from the cloud as rain or (if the cold air below is cold enough) flakes of snow.\n\nOne more thing: all that moving air creates lots of static electricity. Think of rubbing a balloon on your head, or getting clothes from the dryer. That static buildup can result in a discharge - a spark - that also makes a sound. The spark we call lightning and the sound we call thunder.\n\nEverything I've described so far applies to thunderstorms such as we often get in the spring and summer. There's so much heat energy available at these times that air masses can move all over the country, colliding, pushing on one another, and creating storms. In the winter, generally everything is pretty cold, so there's not much energy available to create big air movements. But every once in a while, there's enough energy available to create a powerful snowstorm that includes thunder and lightning.\n\nOne interesting fact, and another reason that thundersnow is so rare, is that the falling snow actually muffles the thunder. While thunder from a rainstorm can be heard many miles away, thunder generated in a snowstorm is often only audible up to two or three miles from the source. This means that even if you are near a rare thundersnow, you may never know it because the snow deadens the sound.\n\nThat is so cool! I love that when I have a science question I can ask the experts right here in the place that I work. Thanks, Steve, for enlightening me. I can't wait to bring this up next time I'm having dinner with friends!The static on the screen is the same static you'll hear between radio stations. Now reach out and put your hand on the screen.\n\nAround one out of every one hundred of those little bursts impacting your hand is caused by a bit of light left over from the Big Bang, the event that began our universe nearly fourteen billion years ago. When you touch that screen, you are touching the Big Bang itself.\n\nWhat does this have to do with modern experiments? On March 21, 2013 the Planck telescope released a much better picture of that same light.\n\nIn fact, this is the most detailed picture ever taken of the \"Cosmic Background Radiation\". It reveals the moment when light was first able to move through our universe. Within the tiny squiggles and bumps in this picture, we see nothing less than the origins of ourselves. The fluctuations in this radiation directed the formation of stars and galaxies. Within the images returned by the Planck telescope, we are truly seeing our own beginnings. We are, in a sense, watching the Big Bang unfold before our eyes.\n\nResearchers with the Planck telescope hope to use this image to gain a better understanding of how and why our universe began. The light waves* that formed this image are the same ones making one percent of that static on your screen. So don't tell me there's nothing on television. You can always watch the Big Bang!\n\n*also known as microwaves, a kind of light that our eyes can't see \u2013 but that's great for popping corn!\n\nAuthor\n\n]]>Fri, 22 Mar 2013 18:29:14 -0400The REAL First Day of Spring\n REAL First Day of SpringTo answer these questions, we have to go back to the REAL first day of spring, or at least the first spring we would recognize as such. We have to go back around four and a half billion years to our planet's early history, a time when we orbited our Sun without a companion, lonely and alone.\n\nThe Earth was a different world then, glowing hot and battered by collisions with asteroids, comets, and all manner of rocky and icy junk flying about the early solar system. A huge asteroid would careen into our planet and a molten pool of rock would form all around the wound, then slowly cool until the next collision occurred. It was a hot, hellish, unrecognizable world. Yet it was the world that would become our home.\n\nOne day on this hot and unfamiliar planet, something deeply profound and nearly catastrophic happened. Our world was hit, not by a bit of space junk the size of a city, but rather by another world.\n\nThis interloping planet, named Theia, was perhaps the size of Mars, perhaps even larger. Its impact nearly ripped the Earth apart. But by chance this monster collision was at just the right angle to produce a shower of debris in the Earth's vicinity. That debris, in time, coalesced to form our Moon.\n\nThe collision also did something else. It knocked the Earth over on its side, resulting in a spinning planet with a tilt of just about 23 degrees from vertical. Why does this matter? It is just this tilt that produces our seasons. As the Earth orbits the Sun, first the northern and then the southern half receive more direct sunlight, resulting in more daylight and warmer temperatures. We call this time summer. When our hemisphere is tilted away from our star, we experience our darker, colder winters. At the two halfway points of the Earth's yearly trip round the Sun, we celebrate the first day of spring (the vernal equinox, if you want to get technical) and the first day of fall (the autumnal equinox).\n\nBut the connection goes much deeper even than that. Mars, with no large moon in orbit, has an axis tilt almost the same as our Earth's. But this is just an accident of history; Mars's tilt changes over time as the planet wobbles through space and is tugged by other passing worlds. Earlier and later in history, Mars' tilt was and will be be very different from Earth's, wreaking havoc with seasons on the Red Planet.\n\nEarth, on the other hand, has a large Moon that orbits relatively nearby. That big, nearby Moon has kept the Earth's axis tilt stable for billions of years, giving us (you guessed it) regular seasons, year after year after year.\n\nSo as you celebrate this year's vernal equinox, take a moment to thank the Moon, whose violent birth and everyday gentle tug makes springtime possible.\n\nAuthorBack in July of 2012, scientists at the LHC reported that they'd found a particle that behaves very much like the Higgs particle. The Higgs particle is not so important in itself, but it gives us clues about the Higgs field, which is the field that gives you and me (and the particles that make us up) mass. They were able to find the Higgs particle ahead of schedule because of a surprising way in which the particle was decaying.\n\nThe best way to think of the Higgs particle is a disturbance (a wave or a wiggle) in the Higgs field. But this disturbance is very unstable. The Higgs particle survives in our world only a tiny fraction of a second, such a short time that we never see the particle itself \u2013 we only see the things it decays into. One of those \"decay paths\" is into two photons \u2013 two very high-energy pieces of light. The experiments at the LHC detected lots and lots of these two photon decays. In fact, it was because there were so many of them that the Higgs discovery could be announced so early in the experiment, long before many expected it.\n\nThis surprising result was exciting news for physicists. They were actually hoping to be wrong about the Higgs. They were hoping that some feature of the Higgs \u2013 such as its likelihood to decay into two photons \u2013 would be wrong. This would point them toward new physics, new ideas, new experiments to try. No one knew if this excess of two photon decays really was new physics, or if it was just luck, a little like rolling doubles three times in a row in Monopoly. Sure it's rare, but rare things do happen (that's what makes them rare and not impossible.)\n\nThe announcement on March 14 of this year was that the extra photon decays really were like rolling doubles three times. If you keep rolling, eventually the doubles streak goes away. That's what happened at the LHC. As they analyzed more and more data, the scientists found that the extra photon decay signal blended into the background. As far as that particular decay is concerned, the Higgs particle seems to behave just as theory would suggest. That's good, it means our theory works, but it's also disappointing, because physicists really, really want to be wrong. It'll tell them what to do next.\n\nAll is not lost, however. We know that our current theories of the world are far, far from complete. We know there are mysteries out there, such as dark matter and dark energy. We have no idea what they are, but we know they exist. We don't understand the mass of neutrinos, or of the Higgs particle itself. We don't yet know what caused the universe to suddenly expand over 13 billion years ago. And of course there's always the mystery of what is a \"Q\" and why do they only use the tip. There's lots more to learn, so keep watching!\n\nAnd then in a twinkling, our breathing did catch,\nAs we watched the craft slow, and the backshell detach.\nThe rockets deployed and the nylon unwound -\nDown the crane Curiosity came with a bound:\n\nIt was gleaming with new lacquer, whiter than snow,\nTo contrast the rusty red dust down below.\nA bundle of instruments sat on its back,\nIn front of the nuclear battery pack.\n\nIts lenses, they twinkled! its MastCam how merry,\nIts cables like honey, ChemCam like a cherry;\nIts six giant wheels, with their high-traction cleats,\nCould turn a full circle in place to retreat;\n\nThe robot arm, long as an old jouster's lance,\nIt pulled tight to itself at the crater's advance.\nThe gold-plated Sample Analysis suite\nWas packed up with tools, like a box full of treats.\n\nIt was ten feet across, a right warrior chief,\nAnd we laughed when we saw it, in utter relief;\nA twist of its mast and the Sky Crane it shed\nSoon gave us to know we had nothing to dread.\n\nIt took not a rest, but went straight to its work,\nAnd scooped up some soil; then turn'd with a jerk,\nAnd, taking commands from down here, I suppose,\nAnd spinning its wheels, up the great Mount it rose.\n\nWith the pow'r of plutonium dioxide decay,\nOur bright Curiosity soldiered away:\nAnd we heard in our heads, as it drove out of sight-\nMerry Mars-mas to all, and to all a good night!\n\nAuthorThe parachute flies away and rockets fire beneath the falling body, slowing its descent further until, at only 66 feet above the surface, the creation hovers in mid-Martian air, balanced over the rocky, uneven surface below.\n\nThen the strangest thing of all happens. What was one object becomes two, as the underbelly of the beast drops down to the surface on a set of cables known as a sky crane. Over the next minute, the lower body descends while the upper craft hovers around 66 feet above the surface. Finally, as the lower craft bites into the Martian dust, the cables break away and the upper craft disappears over the far horizon, never to be heard from again.\n\nT\n\nhis is the strange scene NASA hopes to create in the wee morning hours of August 6, 2012 (COSI time). If all goes well, the Curiosity Rover will awaken from a long slumber in the Gale Crater near the Martian equator, and thereafter begin exploring what could be the most interesting landing site we've ever reached on the Red Planet.\n\nFor most of the history of our species, Mars was but a tiny red-orange dot in a starry night sky. But for us, for we humans lucky enough to live in the first years of the 21st century, Mars is a place, a world, a new land we have just begun to explore with our innovation, or ingenuity, and our curiosity.\n\nThe Rover itself is in many ways the most complex object ever to travel to Mars. The size of a small SUV, the Curiosity Rover is powered by radioactive decay and carries ten precision scientific instruments. Among these instruments is a robotic arm that will drill into Martian rocks, gather soil samples, and deliver those samples to instruments within. Curiosity will be the closest thing we've ever had to a working geologist on the surface of another planet.\n\nWhile Curiosity itself is unlikely to detect life, and in fact the instruments aren't designed for such a detection, it will tell us whether or not the surface of Mars could ever have provided a suitable habitat for living things. For an entire Martian year (around two Earth years), Curiosity will roam the area in and around Gale Crater, helping scientists back on Earth understand the past, present, and future of our neighbor in space.\n\nBut why do we care? So what if once, long ago, Mars was home to microbes? Here's what. If we ever learn that Mars harbored life, then there are three possibilities:\n\nEarth life migrated to Mars through space. While possible, this is unlikely, as it is difficult for rocks blown off Earth (perhaps by meteor impacts) to reach Mars.\n\nMars life migrated to Earth. This is actually much more likely than the former scenario, as it is much easier for rocks to be blasted off Mars (because of its lower gravity), and also more likely that such rocks might one day fall to Earth. If this scenario is true, then we are all Martians! But what if we find that...\n\nLife arose independently on Mars and Earth. This third is the most exciting scenario of all. For if so, then the universe must be teeming with life. One instance of life (on Earth) might be a fluke, not repeated in a billion, or even a hundred billion, worlds. But two examples of life practically side-by-side in the same solar system would indicate that life must be widespread throughout the cosmos.\n\nBut we must also consider possibility 4. Perhaps life never developed on Mars at all. Perhaps life is more delicate than our science currently suggests. Perhaps our Earth really is unique. This fact might remind us all just how precious life really is, and how worthy of celebration.\n\nThe greatest thing about science is that someday (maybe someday soon) we will know. With Curiosity, we will discover secrets about Mars we never dreamt of before, and when we look up on a starry night and see a red-orange dot in the sky, we'll know that dot is a place, a place we humans know a little better now, thanks to a rover with a name befitting the humans who sent it there. Good luck, Curiosity!"}
{"text": "notes17\n\nCourse: ASTR 241, Fall 2011 School: UChicago Rating:\n\nWord Count: 5394\n\nDocument Preview warn you that we are now entering into an area of active research\nwhere there are still very signicant uncertainties. What I will tell you is the best of our\nunderstanding today, but signicant parts of it may well turn out to be wrong. I will try\nto highlight the areas where what I say is least certain, and I will point out a couple of\nplaces where statements asserted quite condently in your textbook have turned out to be\nincorrect.\nI. Post-main sequence evolution\nA. Mass Loss\nOne important eect that distinguishes the evolution of massive stars from that\nof lower mass stars is the importance of mass loss, both on the main sequence\nand thereafter. Low mass stars do not experience signicant mass loss before the\nAGB phase, but massive stars, as we have already seen, can lose mass while still\non the main sequence, and can lose even more after they leave it.\nLike other aspects of stellar mass loss, the exact mechanisms are not understood.\nVery massive stars, those above 85 M or so, lose mass in a rapid and unstable\nmanner. We have already encountered one star like this: Carinae. This is an\nexample of a type of star called a luminous blue variable, or LBV.\n[Slide 1 Car]\nAs these processes reduce the stars mass, its atmosphere becomes less and less\ndominated by hydrogen, eventually reaching X 0.1 or even less. We see these\nstars are somewhat lower mass (but still very massive) stars whose atmospheres\nare dominated by helium rather than hydrogen. These are called Wolf-Rayet\nstars, and they are eectively the bare cores of massive stars. Stars from 10 85\nM skip the LBV phase and go directly to the Wolf-Rayet phase.\nStars become WRs while they are still on the main sequence, i.e. burning hydrogen in their centers. Stars in this case are called WN stars, because they are\nWolf-Rayet stars that show large amounts of nitrogen on their surfaces. The nitrogen is the product of CNO cycle burning, which produces an equilibrium level\nof nitrogen above the amount that the star began its life with.\nWR stars continue to lose mass rapidly, often producing spectacular nebulae that\n1\nlook like planetary nebulae. They shine for the same reason: the expelled gas is\nexposed to the high energy radiation of the star, and it oresces in response.\n[Slides 2, 3 WR nebula NGC 2359, WR 124]\nMass loss continues after the star exhausts H and begin burning He at this point\nthe surface composition changes and we begin to see signs of 3 burning. These\nare WC stars. The continuing mass loss removes the enhanced nitrogen from the\nCNO cycle, and convection brings to the surface the result of 3 burning, which\nis mostly carbon. Very rarely, we see WR stars where the carbon is being blown\no, and the surface is dominated by oxygen.\nThe mass loss can be quite dramatic 100 M stars are thought to get down to\nnearly 30 M by the time they evolve o the main sequence.\nB. Movement on the HR diagram\nWhile these stars show dramatic mass loss, their luminosities do not evolve all\nthat much as they age. That is for the reason we mentioned last time in the\ncontext of low mass stars luminosity evolution: the role of radiation pressure.\nThe luminosity varies as L 4 4 , and is in turn given by the Eddington\nquartic:\n2\nM\n4 4 + 1 = 0.\n0.003\nM\nFor very massive stars, the rst term is dominant, so is roughly constant, and\nL is too. This is simply a reection of the fact that very massive stars are largely\nsupported by radiation pressure. As a result, their luminosity is equal to the\nEddington luminosity, which depends only on total mass, not on composition.\n[Slide 4 Meynet & Maeder tracks]\nThis non-evolution of the luminosity continues to apply even after these stars\nleave the main sequence. As the stars develop inert ash cores and burning shells\nlike lower mass stars, they cannot increase in luminosity, but they can increase\nin radius and go to lower eective temperature. The net eect is that they move\nalong nearly horizontal tracks on the HR diagram. The slide shows the latest\nGeneva models.\nAs you can see, the luminosities increase less and less for stars of higher and higher\nmasses, and instead they evolve at constant luminosity. Thus massive stars never\nhave a red giant phase, since that would require an increase in luminosity.\nC. Internal structure: the onion model\nThe internal structure of a massive star near the end of its lifetime comes to\nresemble an onion. In the center is an ash core, with the type of ash depending\non the stars evolutionary state. At rst it is helium, then carbon, etc., until at\nlast the core is composed of iron. The temperature is high enough that the core\nis never degenerate until the last stages in the stars life, when it consists of iron.\n2\nAbove the core is a burning shell where the next lowest element Z element in the\nburning chain burns. Thus above an iron core is a silicon burning layer, above\na helium core is a carbon burning layer, etc. Outside that shell, there is inert\nmaterial composed of the same element. As one moves further outward in the\nstar, one encounters the next burning shell where a lower Z element burns, and\nso forth until one reaches the hydrogen burning layer and the hydrogen envelope,\nif any is left, above it.\n[Slides 5, 6 schematic representation and numerical computation from Heger et\nal. of onion structure]\nThe onion structure grows until the star develops an iron core. Since iron is at\nthe peak of the binding energy curve, it cannot be further burned. A star with an\niron core and an onion structure around it is known as a supernova progenitor.\nII. Supernovae\nA. Evolution of the Core\nNow consider what happens in the core of a supernova progenitor. The iron core\nis much like the helium core that we discussed in the context of lower mass stars:\nit has no nuclear reactions, so it becomes isothermal. If it gets to be more than\nroughly 10% of the stellar mass, it will exceed the Schnberg-Chandrasekhar limit\no\nand begin contracting dynamically. If it becomes degenerate, degeneracy pressure\ncan slow the collapse, but if the core exceeds the Chandrasekhar mass of 1.4 M ,\nelectron degeneracy pressure cannot hold it up. The core must therefore contract\nonce it exceeds a certain minimum mass.\nContraction creates two instabilities. First, at the high pressures found in the\ncore, heavy nuclei can undergo reactions of the form\nI (A, Z ) + e J (A, Z 1) + e ,\ni.e. nucleus I captures a free electron, which converts one of its protons into a\nneutron. Well discuss why these reactions happen in a few moments. Reactions\nof this sort create an instability because removing electrons reduces the number\nof electrons, and thus the degeneracy pressure. The loss of pressure accelerates\ncollapse, raising the pressure again and driving the reaction to happen even faster.\nSecond, since the gas is degenerate, its pressure is unrelated to its temperature.\nAs it collapses, its temperature rises, but this does not halt the collapse because\nit doesnt raise the pressure. Once the temperature exceeds about 6 7 109 K,\nphotons are able to start photodisintegrating iron via the reaction\n56\nFe + 100 MeV 13 4 He + 4n.\nAs the equation indicates, the reaction is highly endothermic, absorbing about 100\nMeV from the radiation eld, or about 2 MeV per nucleon, each time it happens.\n3\nIn eect, all the energy that was released by burning from He to Fe is now given\nback. The loss of thermal energy also accelerates collapse, which leads the core\nto contract more, which accelerates the reaction, etc.\nBoth of these are ionization-like processes, and they serve to keep a < 4/3, in the\nunstable regime where collapse cannot be halted. Once the collapse proceeds far\nenough, an even more endothermic reaction can take place when photons begin\nto disintegrate helium nuclei:\n4\nHe + 27 MeV 2p + 2n.\nThis reaction absorbs 27 MeV each time it happens, or 6 7 MeV per nucleon.\nThe disintegration of He creates a population of free neutrons and protons. Normally free neutrons spontaneously decay into a proton plus an electron plus a\nneutrino:\nn p + e + e .\nThe free neutron lifetime is 614 seconds, and the reaction is exothermic (as it\nmust be, since it is spontaneous). The energy released can be determined just by\nthe dierence in mass between a proton, mp = 1.67262 1024 g, and a neutron,\nmn = 1.67493 1024 g:\nE = (mn mp )c2 = 1.3 MeV.\nHowever, conditions in the core are very dierent from those in free space. The\nelectrons are highly relativistically degenerate. Consider what this means energetically. Back at the beginning of the class, we showed that, for a population of\ndegenerate electrons, they occupy all quantum states up to a maximum momentum\n1/3\n3h3 n\n,\np0 =\n8\nwhere n is the number density of electrons. If a new electron were to be created\nby the decay of a neutron, it would have to go into an unoccupied quantum state,\nand the rst available state has a momentum a just above p0 . The corresponding\nenergy is\n1 /3\n3h3 n\nE0 = pc =\nc\n8\nin the limit where the electrons are highly relativistic. If we compare this to the\nenergy E that is released by neutron decay, we nd that E0 becomes equal to\nE when\n8 E 3\nn=\n= 9.6 1030 cm3\n3\nch\nIf we have one electron per two nucleons, the average for elements heavier than\nhydrogen, the corresponding mass density is\n1\n= nmp = 8.0 106 g cm3 .\n2\n4\nOnce the density exceeds this value, it is no longer energetically possible for free\nneutrons to undergo spontaneous decay. Instead, the opposite is true, and the\nreverse reaction\np + e n + e\nbegins to occur spontaneously. Each such reaction requires 1.3 MeV of energy, and\neven further reduces the degeneracy pressure of the electrons. Electron capture\nby heavy elements earlier on in the collapse occurs for very similar reasons.\nThe collapse is only halted once another source of pressure becomes available:\nat suciently high density, the neutrons become degenerate. The structure of\nthis degenerate neutron matter is not well understood, and is a subject of active\nresearch, but the bottom line of what we understand seems to be that the collapse\nis halted once the density reaches around 1015 g cm3 . The radius of the core\nat this point is about 40 km, although as the neutron star cools o it eventually\nshrinks to about 10 km. The density of 1015 g cm3 in the core is roughly the\ndensity of an atomic nucleus, so the core at this point is a giant atomic nucleus,\nseveral km is diameter, with the mass of the Sun.\nB. Explosion Mechanism and Energy Budget\nAll of these processes occur in the core on dynamical timescales. The initial\niron core is of order 5, 000 10, 000 km in radius, and the mass is of order a\nChandrasekhar mass, about 1.5 M , so the dynamical time is\n1\n1 second.\ntdyn\nG\nThus the core collapses on a timescale that is tiny compared to the dynamical\ntime of the star as a whole the outer envelope of the star just sits there while\nthe core collapses.\nThe collapse of the iron core causes the material above it to begin falling, and\nthe exact sequence of events thereafter is somewhat unclear. Your book gives the\nimpression that this is a solved problem, but your book is wrong on this point.\nExactly how supernovae work is far from clear. Nonetheless, we can give a rough\noutline and make some general statements.\nFirst of all, we can gure out the energy budget. Ultimately what drives everything is the release of gravitational potential energy by the collapse of the iron\ncore. It is this sudden energy release that explodes the star. The core has an initial mass of Mc 1.5 M , and an initial radius Rc 104 km. The nal neutron\ncore has a comparable mass and a radius of Rnc 20 km. Thus the amount of\nenergy released is\n2\nEgrav GMc\n1\n1\nRc Rnc\n2\nGMc\n3 1053 erg.\nRnc\nOf this, the amount that is used to convert the protons and electrons to neutrons\nis a small fraction. Each conversion ultimately uses up about 7 MeV, so the total\n5\nnuclear energy absorption is\nEnuc = 7 MeV\nMc\nEgrav\n2 1052 erg\n.\nmH\n15\nThus only 10% percent of the energy is used up in converting protons to\nneutrons. The rest is available to power an explosion.\nSimilarly, some of the energy is required to eject the stellar envelope. The binding\nenergy of the envelope to the core is roughly\nEbind =\nEgrav\nGMc (M Mc )\n5 1051 erg\n.\nRc\n60\nThus only a few percent of the available energy is required to unbind the envelope.\nThe remaining energy is available to give the envelope a large velocity, to produce\nradiation, and to drive nuclear reactions in the envelope. We dont have a good\nrst-principles theory capable of telling us how this energy is divided up, but we\ncan infer from observations.\nThe observed speed of the ejecta is around 10,000 km s1 , so the energy required\nto power this is\nEgrav\n1\n.\nEkin = (M Mc )v 2 1051 erg\n2\n300\nFinally, the observed amount that is released as light is comparable to that released in kinetic energy:\nErad 1051 erg\nEgrav\n.\n300\nBoth of these constitute only about 1% of the total power.\nSo where does the rest of the energy go? The answer is that it is radiated away\ntoo, but as neutrinos rather than photons. The neutrinos produces when the\nprotons in the core are converted into neutrons dont escape immediately, but\nthey do eventually escape, and they carry away the great majority of the energy\nwith them. Only about 1% is used to power everything else, but that is more\nthan enough to blow up the star.\nGetting that 1% number from rst principles, and more generally understanding\nthe mechanism by which the energy released in the core is transferred into the\nenvelope of the star, is one of the major problems in astrophysics today. We have\na general outline of what must happen, but really solving the problem is at the\nforefront of numerical simulation science.\nHeres what we know in general outline: as long as the collapsing core has a pressure set by relativistic electrons, its adiabatic index is a = 4/3. As it approaches\nnuclear density and more of the electrons convert to neutrons, it initially experiences an attractive nuclear force that pulls it together, and this has the eect of\n6\npushing a even lower, toward 1, and accelerating the collapse. Once the densities get even higher, though, the strong nuclear force becomes repulsive, and a\nincreases to a value\n4/3.\nThis is sucient to halt collapse of the core, and from the perspective of the\nmaterial falling on top of it, it is as if the core suddenly converted from pressureless\nfoam (a < 4/3) to hard rubber (a > 4/3). The infall is therefore halted suddenly,\nand all the kinetic energy of the infalling material is converted to thermal energy.\nThis thermal energy raises the pressure, which then causes the material above the\nneutron core to re-expand it bounces. The bounce launches a shock wave out\ninto the envelope.\nThe bounce by itself does not appear to be sucient to explode the star. The\nshock wave launched by the bounce stalls out before it reaches the stellar surface.\nHowever, at the same time all of this is going on, the core is radiating neutrinos\nlike crazy. Every proton that is converted into a neutron leads to emission of a\nneutrino, and the collapsing star is suciently dense the that neutrinos cannot\nescape. Instead, they deposit their energy inside the star above the core, further\nheating the material there and raising its pressure.\nThe neutrinos are thought to somehow re-energize the explosion and allow it to\nnally break out of the star. Heres an example of a computer simulation where\nthis happens:\n[Slide 7 Adam Burrows supernova simulation]\nHowever, there are lots of details missing, and it turns out to be much easier to\nexplode stars in 2D (which this simulation uses) than in 3D. The problem is not\nsolved.\nC. Nucleosynthesis\nThe shock propagating outward through the star from the core heats the gas up\nto 5 109 K, and this is hot enough to induce nuclear burning in the envelope.\nThis burning changes the chemical composition of the envelope, creating new\nelements. Much of the material is heated up enough that it burns to the iron\npeak, converting yet more of the star into iron-like elements.\nI say iron-like because the initial product is not in fact iron. The reason is that\nthe most bound element, 56 Fe, consists of 26 protons and 28 neutrons, so it has\ntwo more neutrons than protons. The fuel, consisting mostly of elements like 4 He,\n12\nC, 16 O, 28 Si, all have equal numbers of protons and neutrons. Thus there are\nnot enough neutrons around to pair up with all the protons to make 56 Fe.\nConverting protons to neutrons is via decays is possible, and in fact it is the\nrst step in the pp-chain. However, as we learned studying that reaction, decays\nare slow, and in the few seconds that it takes for the shock to propagate through\nthe star, there is not enough time for them to occur.\n7\nThe net result is that the material burns to as close to the iron peak as it can get\ngiven the ratio of protons to neutrons available. This turns out to be 56 Ni. This\nis not a stable nucleus, since it is subject to decay, but the timescale for decay\nis much longer than the supernova explosion goes on for, so no beta decays occur\nuntil long after the nucleosynthetic process is over.\nNot all the material in the star is burned to the iron peak. As the shock wave\npropagates through the star it slows down and heats things up less. The net\nresults is that material further out in the star gets less burned, so the supernova\nwinds up ejecting a large amounts of other elements as well. Calculating the exact\nyields from rst principles is one of the goals of supernova models.\nD. Observations\n1. Light Curves\nWhen a supernova goes o, what do we observe from the outside? The rst\nthing, which was only seen for the rst time a couple of years ago, is a bright\nultraviolet ash from the shock breaking out of the stellar surface. We saw\nthis because Alicia Soderberg, a postdoc at Princeton (as was I at the time)\ngot very lucky. She was using an x-ray telescope to study an older supernova\nin a galaxy, when she saw another one go o. The telescope was observing\nthe star as it exploded, and it saw a ash of x-rays as the shock wave from\nthe deep interior of the star reached the surface.\n[Slide 8 Soderberg image]\nAfter the initial ash in x-rays, it takes a little while before the optical emission reaches its peak brightness. That is because the expanding material\ninitially has a small area, and most of that emission is at wavelengths shortward of visible. As the material expands and cools, its optical luminosity\nincreases, and reaches its peak a few weeks after the explosion. After that\nit decays. The decay can initially take one of two forms, called linear or\nplateau, but after a while they all converge to the same slope of luminosity\nversus time.\n[Slide 9 light curve image]\nThis slope can be understood quite simply from nuclear physics. As we\nmentioned a moment ago, the supernova synthesizes large amounts of 56 Ni.\nThis nickel is unstable, and it undergoes the decay reaction\n56\n28 Ni\n56\n27 Co\n+ e+ + e +\nwith a half-life of 6.1 days. This is short enough that most of the nickel decays\nduring the initial period of brightening or shortly thereafter.\nHowever, the resulting\nreaction:\n56\nCo is also unstable, and it too undergoes a decay\n56\n27 Co\n8\n56\n26 Fe\n+ e+ + e + .\nThis reaction has a half-life of 77.7 days, and it turns out to be the dominant\nsource of energy for the supernova in the period from a few tens to a few\nhundreds of days after peak. The expanding material is cooling o, and this\nwould cause the luminosity to drop, but the radioactive decays provide a\nenergy source that keeps the material hot and emitting.\nBy computing the rate of energy release as a function of time via the decay\nof cobalt-56, we can gure out how the luminosity of the supernova should\nchange as a function of time. Radioactive decays are a statistical process, in\nwhich during a given interval of time there is a xed probability that each\natom will decay. This implies that the number of cobalt-56 decays per unit\ntime that occur in a particular supernova remnant must be proportional to\nthe number of cobalt-56 atoms present:\ndN\n= N.\ndt\nHere N is the number of cobalt-56 atoms present and is a constant. The\nequation simply asserts that the rate of change of the number of cobalt-56\natoms at any given time is proportional to the number of atoms present at\nthat time.\nThis equation is easy to integrate by separation of variables:\ndN\n= dt\nN\nN = N0 et ,\n=\nwhere N0 is the number of atoms present at time t = 0. The quantity is\nknown as the decay rate. To see how it is related to the half-life 1/2 , we can\njust plug in t = 1/2 :\n1\nN0 = N0 e1/2\n2\nFor\n56\n=\n=\nln 2\n.\n1 /2\nCo, = 0.0039 / day.\nWhile radioactive decay is the dominant energy source, the luminosity is\nsimply proportional to the rate of energy release by radioactive decay, which\nin turn is proportional to the number of atoms present at any time, i.e. L N .\nThis means that the instantaneous luminosity should follow\nL et\n=\nlog L = (log e)t + constant.\nThus for the cobalt-56-powered part of the decay, a plot of log L versus time\nshould be a straight line with a slope of\n(log e) = 0.0017 day1 .\nAn excellent test for this model was provided by supernova 1987A, which went\nof in 1987 in the Large Magellanic Cloud, a nearby galaxy. The supernova\n9\nwas observed for more than ve years after the explosion, and as a result we\ngot a very good measure of how its luminosity dropped. We can see a clear\nperiod when the slope follows exactly what we have just calculated. Once\nenough of the 56 Co decayed, other radioactive decays with longer half-lives\ntook over.\n[Slide 10 light curve of SN1987A]\nThe eect is even more prominent in type Ia supernovae, which are produced\nwhen a white dwarf is pushed over the Chandrasekhar limit. In that case the\nnuclear reaction burns a much larger fraction of the star to 56 Ni, so its decay\ninto cobalt and then iron completely dominates the light curve.\n2. Neutrinos\nSupernova 1987A also provided strong evidence for another basic idea in supernova theory: that supernovae involve the neutronization of large amounts\nof matter, and with it the production of copious neutrino emission. The rst\ndetection of supernova 1987A was not its light. The shock wave takes some\ntime to propagate through the star after the core collapses. The neutrinos,\nhowever, escape promptly, and on February 23, 1987 the Kamiokande II neutrino detector in Japan and the IMB detector in Ohio both measured a burst\nof neutrinos that arrived more than three hours before the rst detection of\nvisible light from the supernova. Burst is perhaps too strong a word, since\nthe total number of neutrinos detected was 20 neutrinos are hard to measure! Nonetheless, this was vastly above the noise level, and provided the\nrst direct evidence that a supernova explosion involves release of neutrinos.\n3. Historical importance\nA brief aside: because of their brightness and the long duration for which they\nare visible, supernovae played an important part in the early development of\nastronomy, and in the history of science in general. In November of 1572,\na supernova went o that was, at its peak, comparable in brightness to the\nplanet Venus. For about two weeks the supernova was visible even during the\nday. It remained visible to the naked eye until 1574.\nThe 1572 supernova was so bright that no one could have missed it. One of\nthe people to observe it was the Dane Tycho Brahe, who said On the 11th\nday of November in the evening after sunset, I was contemplating the stars in\na clear sky. I noticed that a new and unusual star, surpassing the other stars\nin brilliancy, was shining almost directly above my head; and since I had, from\nboyhood, known all the stars of the heavens perfectly, it was quite evident\nto me that there had never been any star in that place of the sky, even the\nsmallest, to say nothing of a star so conspicuous and bright as this. I wqs so\nastonished of this sight that I was not ashamed to doubt the trustworthyness\nof my own eyes. But when I observed that others, on having the place pointed\nout to them, could see that there was really a star there, I had no further\n10\ndoubts. A miracle indeed, one that has never been prevoiously seen before\nour time, in any age since the beginning of the world.\n[Slide 11 plate from Tychos Stella Nova]\nTycho was so impressed by the event that he wrote a book about it and\ndecided to devote his life to astronomy. He went on to make the observations\nthat were the basis of Keplers Laws. Kepler himself saw another supernova\nin 1604. The supernovae played a critical role in the history of science because\nthey provided clear falsication of the idea that the stars were eternal and\nunchanging, which had dominated Western scientic thought since the time\nof the ancient Greeks. Previous variable events in the sky, such as comets,\nwere taken to be atmospheric phenomena, and there was no easy way to\ndisprove this. With the supernovae, however, they persisted long enough to\nmake parallax observations possible. The failure to detect a parallax for the\nsupernovae provide without a doubt that they were further away than the\nmoon, in the supposedly eternal and unchanging realm outside the terrestrial\nsphere.\nUnfortunately for us, Tychos supernova was the last one to go o in our\ngalaxy (unless one went o on the far side of the galactic center, where we\nwouldnt be able to see it due to obscuring dust). A number of astronomers\nwould very much like there to be another one, since astronomical instrumentation has improved a bit since Tychos day...\nIII. Supernova Remnants\nThe material ejected into space by a supernova into space slams into the interstellar\nmedium, the gas between the stars, at a velocity up from a few to ten percent of the\nspeed of light. When this collision happens, it creates a shock in the interstellar medium\nthat heats interstellar gas to temperatures of millions of K. The shocked bubble lled\nwith hot gas is known as a supernova remnant, and such remnants can be visible for\nmany thousands of years after the supernova itself fades from view.\nThe association of these structures with supernovae can be demonstrated quite clearly\nby looking with modern telescopes at the locations of historical supernovae. For example, remnants have been identied for both Tychos and Keplers supernovae, and\nanother for the Crab supernova (named after the constellation where it is located).\nThe Crab supernova was recorded in 1054 by Chinese astronomers no one in Europe\nat the time was paying attention to the sky, or if they were, they didnt bother to write\nit down.\n[Slides 12 - 14 Tychos SNR, Keplers SNR, and the Crab SNR]\nWe can understand the structure of a supernova remnant using a simple mathematical\nargument made independently by L. I. Sedov in the USSR and G. I. Taylor in the\nUK. These authors discovered the solution independently because Taylor discovered it\nwhile working in secret on the British atomic bomb project, which was later merged\n11\nwith the American one. It turns out that the problems of a supernova exploding in the\ninterstellar medium and a nuclear bomb exploding in the atmosphere are quite similar\nphysically. Sedov published his solution in 1946, just after the end of Wolrd War II,\nwhile Taylors work was still secret.\nConsider an idealized version of the supernova problem. An explosion occurs at a point,\nreleasing an energy E . The explosion occurs inside a medium of constant density ,\nand we assume that the energy of the explosion is so large that the pressure it exerts is\nvastly greater than the pressure in the ambient material, so that the ambient gas can\nbe assumed to be pressureless. This is a very good approximation for both supernovae\nand nuclear bombs. We would like to solve for the position of the shock front r as a\nfunction of time t.\nThe mathematical argument used to solve this relies on nothing more than fancy\ndimensional analysis. Consider the units of the given quantities. We have the energy\nE , density , radius r, and time t, which have units as follows:\n[r]\n[t]\n[ ]\n[E ]\n=\n=\n=\n=\nL\nT\nM L3\nM L2 T 2 .\nHere L means units of length, T means units of time, and M means units of mass.\nThus a density is a mass per unit volume, which is a mass per length cubed. Energy\nhas units of ergs of Joules, which is a mass times an acceleration times a distance, and\nacceleration is distance per time squared.\nWe want to have a formula for r in terms t, , and E . It is clear, however, that there\nis only one way to put together t, , and E such that the nal answer has the units of\nlength! The mass must cancel out of the problem, so clearly the solution must involve\nE/. This has units\nE\n= L5 T 2 .\nWe want to obtain something with units of length, so clearly the next step is to cancel\nout the T 2 by multiplying by t2 . This gives\nE2\nt = L5 .\nFinally, to get something with units of L and not L5 , we must take the 1/5 power.\nThus, the radius of the shock as a function of time must, on dimensional grounds, be\ngiven by\n1/5\nE\nr=Q\nt2/5 ,\nwhere Q is a dimensionless constant. Similarly, the shock velocity as a function of time\n12\nmust follow\ndr\n2\nE\nv=\n=Q\ndt\n5\n1/5\nt3/5 .\nActually solving the equations of uid dynamics shows that\nQ=\n75\n16\n(a 1)(a + 1)2\n3a 1\n1/5\n,\nwhere a is the adiabatic index of the gas into which the shock propagates.\nTaylor used this solution to deduce the energy of the rst atomic explosion at Trinity\nusing nothing but photos of the blast wave at dierent times that has been published\nin newspapers and magazines. When he published the result in 1950, a number of\npeople were not happy.\nFor supernovae we generally cant see them expand the expansion takes too long.\nHowever, we can obtain a relationship we can test between the temperature of the\nshocked material and the radius of the remnant. At the shock the kinetic energy of\nthe expanding gas is converted into heat, so the temperature at the shock, which is a\nmeasure of internal energy per unit mass, is simply proportional to the kinetic energy\nper unit mass, which varies as v 2 . Thus we have\n2\nTshock v\nE\n2/5\nt6/5 .\nNow let us rewrite this in terms of the radius. Solving the rst equation for t, we have\nt\nE\n1/2\nr 5/2 ,\nand plugging this into our equation for the shock temperature, we have\nTshock\nE 3\nr.\nThus the temperature of supernova remnants should decrease as the third power of\ntheir size, assuming roughly constant energy and ISM density. Small remnants such as\nKeplers, Tychos, and the Crab are visible in x-rays, but the rapid temperature drop\nwith size ensures that, once they expand signicantly, they cool o too much to be\nvisible in x-rays. 112: The Physics of StarsClass 18 Notes: Neutron Stars and Black HolesIn the last class we discussed the violent deaths of massive stars via supernovae.

Then, all of the sudden, a blast of cosmic winds from the galaxy next door comes along, and toasts you, your planet, and all the other planets in your part of the galaxy. Sound far-fetched? It's not. In fact, it's happening right now.

Turns out, they're the coldest of motherfuckers. Not only do they gobble up stars, but whilst they do so the stars are all \"Jesus Christ, stop, stop!\" screaming with little dignity and no resignation.\n\nThe cosmos is goddamn impressive for a variety of reasons.

{"text": "DailyGa\n\nThe spectacular new image above orange glow represents faint light coming from grains of cold interstellar dust , at wavelengths too long for human eyes to see.\n\nThe Danish 1.54-metre telescope located at ESO's La Silla Observatory in Chile has captured a striking image of NGC 6559, a cloud of gas and dust located at a distance of about 5000 light-years from Earth, showcasing the anarchy that reigns when stars form inside an interstellar cloud . The glowing region is a relatively small object, just a few light-years across, in contrast to the one hundred light-years and more spanned by its famous neighbor, the Lagoon Nebula ( Messier 8 , eso0936). Although it is usually overlooked in favor of its distinguished companion, NGC 6559 has the leading role in this new picture. The gas in the clouds of NGC 6559, mainly hydrogen, is the raw material for star formation. When a region inside this nebula gathers enough matter, it starts to collapse under its own gravity. The center of the cloud grows ever denser and hotter, until thermonuclear fusion begins and a star is born.\n\nA team of astronomers has used the new ALMA ( Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array ) telescope to pinpoint the locations of over 100 of the most fertile star-forming galaxies in the early Universe . ALMA is so powerful that, in just a few hours, it captured as many observations of these galaxies as have been made by all similar telescopes worldwide over a span of more than a decade. The most fertile bursts of star birth in the early Universe took place in distant galaxies containing lots of cosmic dust. These galaxies are of key importance to our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution over the history of the Universe, but the dust obscures them and makes them difficult to identify with visible-light telescopes. To pick them out, astronomers must use telescopes that observe light at longer wavelengths, around one millimetre, such as ALMA. \"Astronomers have waited for data like this for over a decade.\n\nA laboratory experiment at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory , Pasadena, Calif., simulating the atmosphere of Saturn's moon Titan suggests complex organic chemistry that could eventually lead to the building blocks of life extends lower in the atmosphere than previously thought. The results now point out another region on the moon that could brew up prebiotic materials. \"Scientists previously thought that as we got closer to the surface of Titan, the moon's atmospheric chemistry was basically inert and dull,\" said Murthy Gudipati, the paper's lead author at JPL. \"Our experiment shows that's not true.\n\nMany biologists still view RNA as a messenger to shutlle inforamtion from DNA to the cell's protein manufacturing centers, ribosomes. Like DNA, RNA is a string of four different kinds of nucleotide building blocks, except that RNA has a single chain rather than DNA's iconic double helix that uses a different sugar in its molecular architecture, and substitutes uracil instead of thymine. However, unlike DNA, RNA is capable of carrying both genetic information and getting metabolic work done making it the \" \" molecule capabable of both reproducing itself and carrying the code to guide the needed copying. Some bacterial cells can swim, morph into new forms and even become dangerously virulent - all without initial involvement of DNA.\n\nThe team created experiments with powerful laboratory \"guns\" and computer models that replicated the conditions that existed inside comets that hit Earth's atmosphere at almost 25,000 miles per hour and crashed down upon the surface. The research is part of a broader scientific effort to understand how amino acids and other ingredients for the first living things appeared on a planet that billions of years ago was barren and desolate. Amino acids make up proteins, which are the workhorses of all forms of life, ranging from microbes to people. \"Our research shows that the building blocks of life could, indeed, have remained intact despite the tremendous shock wave and other violent conditions in a comet impact,\" Blank said.\n\n\"We are trying to understand the chemical origins of life. One of the interesting questions is where carbohydrates come from because they are the building blocks of DNA and RNA . What we have achieved is the first step on that pathway to show how simple sugars \u2013threose and erythrose\u2014originated. We generated these sugars from a very simple set of materials that most scientists believe were around at the time that life began.\" All biological molecules have an ability to exist as left-handed forms or right-handed forms.\n\ndiscovered the first known mechanism by which cells control the survival of messenger (mRNA) -- arguably biology's most important molecule. The findings pertain to mRNAs that help regulate and could therefore have implications for reversing cancer's out-of-control cell division. The study was carried out in yeast cells using advanced microscope technology developed previously by Dr. Singer that has allowed scientists, for the first time, to observe single molecules in single cells in real time.\n\nOrganic chemists at the University of York have made a significant advance towards establishing the origin of the carbohydrates (sugars) that form the building blocks of life. Researchers at Albert Einstein College of Medicine of Yeshiva University have discovered the first known mechanism by which cells control the survival of messenger RNA (mRNA) -- arguably biology's most important molecule.\n\nHow did life on Earth begin? An giant step toward solving this puzzle was taken in the 1980's with the Nobel Prize\u2013winning discovery by Tom Cech and Sidney Altman that RNA, the sister molecule of DNA, can catalyze certain chemical reactions inside cells, a job previously thought to be the exclusive domain of proteins. Until their discovery, RNA was thought to have just one function: storing the genetic information cells need to build proteins.\n\nRNA plays a critical role in directing the creation of proteins, but there is more to the life of an RNA molecule than simply carrying DNA's message.\n\nIt's paradoxical that as our leading microbiologists look to create the building blocks of life in Earth-bound labs, our Universe is alive with the building blocks for DNA and RNA. The giant gas nebula in outer space are rife with sugars that form ribose --the backbone of RNA."}

{"text": "Radio Telescopes Capture Best-Ever Snapshot Of Black Hole Jets\n\nMay 20, 2011\nTrent158\nRADIO TELESCOPES CAPTURE BEST-EVER SNAPSHOT OF BLACK HOLE JETS\nWASHINGTON -- An international team, including NASA-funded\nresearchers, using radio telescopes located throughout the Southern\nHemisphere has produced the most detailed image of particle jets\nerupting from a supermassive black hole in a nearby galaxy.\n\"These jets arise as infalling matter approaches the black hole, but\nwe don't yet know the details of how they form and maintain\nthemselves,\" said Cornelia Mueller, the study's lead author and a\ndoctoral student at the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg in Germany.\nThe new image shows a region less than 4.2 light-years across -- less\nthan the distance between our sun and the nearest star.\nRadio-emitting features as small as 15 light-days can be seen, making\nthis the highest-resolution view of galactic jets ever made. The\nstudy will appear in the June issue of Astronomy and Astrophysics and\nis available online.\nMueller and her team targeted Centaurus A (Cen A), a nearby galaxy\nwith a supermassive black hole weighing 55 million times the sun's\nmass. Also known as NGC 5128, Cen A is located about 12 million\nlight-years away in the constellation Centaurus and is one of the\nfirst celestial radio sources identified with a galaxy.\nSeen in radio waves, Cen A is one of the biggest and brightest objects\nin the sky, nearly 20 times the apparent size of a full moon. This is\nbecause the visible galaxy lies nestled between a pair of giant\nradio-emitting lobes, each nearly a million light-years long.\nThese lobes are filled with matter streaming from particle jets near\nthe galaxy's central black hole. Astronomers estimate that matter\nnear the base of these jets races outward at about one-third the\nspeed of light.\nUsing an intercontinental array of nine radio telescopes, researchers\nfor the TANAMI (Tracking Active Galactic Nuclei with Austral\nMilliarcsecond Interferometry) project were able to effectively zoom\ninto the galaxy's innermost realm.\n\"Advanced computer techniques allow us to combine data from the\nindividual telescopes to yield images with the sharpness of a single\ngiant telescope, one nearly as large as Earth itself,\" said Roopesh\nOjha at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md.\nThe enormous energy output of galaxies like Cen A comes from gas\nfalling toward a black hole weighing millions of times the sun's\nmass. Through processes not fully understood, some of this infalling\nmatter is ejected in opposing jets at a substantial fraction of the\nspeed of light. Detailed views of the jet's structure will help\nastronomers determine how they form.\nThe jets strongly interact with surrounding gas, at times possibly\nchanging a galaxy's rate of star formation. Jets play an important\nbut poorly understood role in the formation and evolution of\ngalaxies. NASA's Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope has detected much\nhigher-energy radiation from Cen A's central region.\n\"This radiation is billions of times more energetic than the radio\nwaves we detect, and exactly where it originates remains a mystery,\"\nsaid Matthias Kadler at the University of Wuerzburg in Germany and a\ncollaborator of Ojha. \"With TANAMI, we hope to probe the galaxy's\ninnermost depths to find out.\"\nOjha is funded through a Fermi investigation on multiwavelength\nstudies of Active Galactic Nuclei.\nThe astronomers credit continuing improvements in the Australian Long\nBaseline Array (LBA) with TANAMI's enormously increased image quality\nand resolution. The project augments the LBA with telescopes in South\nAfrica, Chile and Antarctica to explore the brightest galactic jets\nin the southern sky.\nNASA's Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope is an astrophysics and particle\nphysics partnership, developed in collaboration with the U.S.\nDepartment of Energy, along with important contributions from\nacademic institutions and partners in France, Germany, Italy, Japan,\nSweden and the U.S. The Australia Long Baseline Array is part of the\nAustralia Telescope National Facility, which is funded by the\nCommonwealth of Australia for operation as a National Facility\nmanaged by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research\nOrganization.\nFor more information and images"}
{"text": "Combined with newborn stars.\n: a spiral galaxy around 30 thousand light-years across located only about 21 million light-years beyond the stars of the Milky Way. Along with prominent dust lanes and a bright central core, this colorful composite image highlights youthful blue star clusters and reddish stellar nurseries that trace the galaxy's spiral arms. The high resolution galaxy portrait is a mosaic of data from Hubble's sharp ACS camera combined with groundbased color image data. M106 (aka NGC 4258) is a nearby example of the Seyfert class of active galaxies, seen across the spectrum from radio to X-rays. Energetic active galaxies are powered by matter falling into a massive central black hole.\n\nStars, like bees, swarm around the center of bright globular cluster M15. This ball of over 100,000 stars is a relic from the early years of our Galaxy, and continues to orbit the Milky Way's center. M15, one of about 150 globular clusters remaining, is noted for being easily visible with only binoculars, having at its center one of the densest concentrations of stars known, and containing a high abundance of variable stars and pulsars. This sharp image, taken by the Earth-orbiting Hubble Space Telescope, spans about 120 light years. It shows the dramatic increase in density of stars toward the cluster's center. M15 lies about 35,000 light years away toward the constellation of the Winged Horse (Pegasus). Recent evidence indicates that a massive black hole might reside as the center of M15.\n\nSome spiral galaxies are seen almost sideways. NGC 3190, one such galaxy, is the largest member of the Hickson 44 Group, one of the nearer groups of galaxies to our own Local Group of galaxies. Pictured above, finely textured dust lanes surround the brightly glowing center of this picturesque spiral. Gravitational tidal interactions with other members of its group have likely caused the spiral arms of NGC 3190 to appear asymmetric around the center, while the galactic disk also appears warped. NGC 3190 spans about 75,000 light years across and is visible with a small telescope toward the constellation of the Lion (Leo).\n\nIn 1787, astronomer William Herschel discovered the Eskimo Nebula. From the ground, NGC 2392 resembles a person's head surrounded by a parka hood. In 2000, the Hubble Space Telescope imaged the Eskimo Nebula. From space, the nebula displays gas clouds so complex they are not fully understood. The Eskimo Nebula is clearly a planetary nebula, and the gas seen above composed the outer layers of a Sun-like star only 10,000 years ago. The inner filaments visible above are being ejected by strong wind of particles from the central star. The outer disk contains unusual light-year long orange filaments. The Eskimo Nebula spans about 1/3 of a light year and lies in our Milky Way Galaxy, about 3,000 light years distant, toward the constellation of the Twins (Gemini).\n\nSnow-capped stratovolcano Mt. Damavand climbs to 5,670 meters (18,598 feet) near the left edge in this panoramic view of the world at night. In the sky to the left of Damavand's peak are the stars of the Big Dipper in Ursa Major. Pan to the right and your gaze will sweep across the arch of our Milky Way Galaxy above the Alborz Mountain Range bordering the Caspian Sea. Near the center of the panorama, recorded in the predawn hours of April 4th, bright stars Deneb and Altair lie close to the curve of the Milky Way, above the glow of the Haraz valley. Farther right, brilliant Jupiter dominates the sky near the stars, nebulae, and dark dust clouds toward the bulging galactic center. Finally, the horizon glow at the right edge, below bright yellowish giant star Antares, is from the city of Damavand, named for the legendary mountain peak.\n\nGrand spiral galaxies often seem to get all the glory. Their newly formed, bright, blue star clusters along beautiful, symmetric spiral arms are guaranteed to attract attention. But small irregular galaxies form stars too, like NGC 4449, located about 12 million light-years away. The well-studied galaxy is similar in size, and often compared to our Milky Way's satellite galaxy, the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). This lovely color image shows NGC 4449's general bar shape, also characteristic of the LMC, with scattered young blue star clusters. Near the bottom is the pinkish glow of atomic hydrogen gas, the telltale tracer of massive star forming regions. NGC 4449 is a member of a group of galaxies found in the constellation Canes Venatici. In fact, interactions with nearby galaxies are thought to have influenced star formation in NGC 4449.\n\nWhy is Saturn partly blue? The above picture of Saturn approximates what a human would see if hovering close to the giant ringed world. The above picture was taken in mid-March by the robot Cassini spacecraft now orbiting Saturn. Here Saturn's majestic rings appear directly only as a thin vertical line. The rings show their complex structure in the dark shadows they create on the image left. Saturn's fountain moon Enceladus, only about 500 kilometers across, is seen as the bump in the plane of the rings. The northern hemisphere of Saturn can appear partly blue for the same reason that Earth's skies can appear blue -- molecules in the cloudless portions of both planet's atmospheres are better at scattering blue light than red. When looking deep into Saturn's clouds, however, the natural gold hue of Saturn's clouds becomes dominant. It is not known why southern Saturn does not show the same blue hue -- one hypothesis holds that clouds are higher there. It is also not known why Saturn's clouds are colored gold.\n\nIfComet Bradfield is easy to see on the left, but can you find Comet LINEAR on the right? Last week, just before sunrise from the northern hemisphere, two bright comets were visible in the same part of the sky at the same time. The above long-exposure image was taken on the morning of April 25 from Joshua Tree National Park in California, USA. Comet C/2004 F4 (Bradfield) is giving an unexpectedly good show as it recedes from the Sun and Earth and fades from view. Its tail is estimated by some to be about 10 degrees long. Having just rounded the Sun itself, Comet C/2002 T7 (LINEAR) is now moving toward the Earth. Although intrinsically fading, T7 will appear to brighten until about mid-May and so continue to be visible to the unaided eye before sunrise to southern hemisphere observers into June. Q4, the third coincidental naked eye comet, will become visible in mid-May to northern hemisphere observers.\n\nThe star cluster at lower right, cataloged as Hodge 301, is a denizen of the Tarantula Nebula. An evocative nebula in the southern sky, the sprawling cosmic Tarantula is an energetic star forming region some 168,000 light-years distant in our neighboring galaxy the Large Magellanic Cloud. The stars within Hodge 301 formed together tens of millions of years ago and as the massive ones quickly exhaust their nuclear fuel they explode. In fact, the giant stars of Hodge 301 are rapidly approaching this violent final phase of stellar evolution - known as a supernova. These supernova blasts send material and shock waves back into the nebular gas to create the Tarantula's glowing filaments also visible in this Hubble Space Telescope Heritage image. But these spectacular stellar death explosions signal star birth as well, as the blast waves condense gas and dust to ultimately form the next generation of stars inside the Tarantula Nebula.\n\nCones, pillars, and majestic flowing shapes abound in stellar nurseries where natal clouds of gas and dust are buffeted by energetic winds from newborn stars. A well-known example, the Cone Nebula within the bright galactic star-forming region NGC 2264, was captured in this close-up view from the Hubble Space Telescope's newest camera. While the Cone Nebula, about 2,500 light-years away in Monoceros, is around 7 light-years long, the region pictured here surrounding the cone's blunted head is a mere 2.5 light-years across. In our neck of the galaxy that distance is just over half way from the Sun to its nearest stellar neighbor, Alpha Centauri. The massive star NGC 2264 IRS, seen by Hubble's infrared camera in 1997, is the likely source of the wind sculpting the Cone Nebula and lies off the top of the image. The Cone Nebula's reddish veil is produced by glowing hydrogen gas.\n\nYou may think it's impossible to see through the Sun, but maps of the Sun's far side are now made routinely by instruments on board the sun-staring SOHO spacecraft. This is one such map from April 12. At right, is a map projection of calculated magnetic field strengths on the Earth-facing solar hemisphere with yellow and red indicating high magnetic fields characteristic of solar active regions. At left is a similar map of the solar hemisphere opposite planet Earth, which shows the large active region AR9393 as the 27-day solar rotation carried it across the far side. The largest sunspot group in a decade, AR9393 was easily seen as it tracked across the Sun's Earth-facing hemisphere in late March. When AR9393 swung around to the Sun's far side, SOHO's Michelson Doppler Interferometer (MDI) instrument continued to map its position by measuring changes in motions caused by solar sound waves - transmitted through the Sun and influenced by the active region's strong magnetic fields. Known as helioseismology, analyzing solar sound waves is like using seismological records of earthquakes to probe the interior of the Earth. On the Sun, sound waves are produced by turbulent convection cells seen on the surface as dynamic solar granules.\n\nDrifting through the stratosphere above Antarctica in late 1998, the balloon-borne BOOMERANG telescope peered into the cosmos at millimeter wavelengths. The blotchy structures it detected are seen above in the sharpest yet picture of the universe at an early age, perhaps a mere 300,000 years old. The false-color image shows subtle fluctuations in the temperature of the hot plasma which filled the universe before expansion cooled the material, producing the familiar stars and galaxies. Dramatically, the size of the fluctuations in the BOOMERANG image has convinced many cosmologists that the universe contains just exactly enough matter and energy to be flat -- a powerful prediction of the popular theory of Inflation which describes the earliest moments of the Big Bang. A flat universe will expand forever and two light rays which start out parallel will never spread or intersect. But all is not solved (!) as the BOOMERANG results don't show clearly details confirming the suspected amounts of dark matter and the cosmological constant.\n\nOne of the largest coherent structures on the sky is known simply as Loop I and can best be seen in radio and X-ray maps. Spanning over 100 degrees, part of Loop I appears so prominent in northern sky maps that it is known as the North Polar Spur (NPS). Loop I, shown above in X-ray light, is a thin bubble of gas about 700 light-years across with a center located only about 400 light-years away. Surprisingly, the cause of this immense structure is still debated, but is possibly related to expanding gas from a million-year old supernova. Loop I gas is impacting the nearby Aquila Rift molecular cloud, and may create relatively dense fragments of the local interstellar medium. Were our Sun to pass through one of these fragments in the next few million years, it might affect Earth's climate.\n\nHumans once walked on the Moon. Pictured above is the second person to stand on the lunar surface: The Apollo missions demonstrated that it is possible to land humans on the Moon and return them safely.\n\nWhat are those strange blue objects? Many are images of a single, unusual, beaded, blue, ring-like galaxy which just happens to line-up behind a giant cluster of galaxies. Cluster galaxies here appear yellow and -- together with the cluster's dark matter -- act as a gravitational lens. A gravitational lens can create several images of background galaxies, analogous to the many points of light one would see while looking through a wine glass at a distant street light. The distinctive shape of this background galaxy -- which is probably just forming -- has allowed astronomers to deduce that it has separate images at 4, 8, 9 and 10 o'clock, from the center of the cluster. Possibly even the blue smudge just left of center is yet another image! This spectacular photo from HST was taken in October 1994. The first cluster lens was found unexpectedly by Roger Lynds (NOAO) and Vahe Petrosian (Stanford) in 1986 while testing a new type of imaging device. Lensed arcs around this cluster, CL0024+1654, were first discovered from the ground by David Koo (UCO Lick) in 1988.\n\nThis breathtaking patch of sky would be above you were you to stand at the south pole of the Earth. Just above and to the right of the photograph's center are the four stars that mark the boundaries of the famous Southern Cross. At the top of this constellation, also known as \"The Crux,\" is the orange star Gamma Crucis. The band of stars, dust, and gas crossing the middle of the photograph is part our Milky Way Galaxy. In the very center of the photograph is the dark Coal Sack Nebula, and the bright nebula on the far right is the Eta Carina Nebula. The southern cross is so famous a constellation that it is depicted on the Australian National Flag."}

It is\nbelieved that our Milky Way galaxy contains a few hundred million\nstellar-mass black holes. A small number of these black holes are in\nclose binary systems with a normal star. If the star is close enough,\ngas from its outer layers can bleed onto the black hole.

In total, we obtained several\ndozen spectral and imaging observations during the fall of last year.\nThe Doppler velocities of the companion star, which are inferred from\nthe spectra, show that its orbital velocity in the line-of-sight exceeds\n110 km/sec (for comparison, the Earth's orbital speed is 32 km/sec). A\ndetailed analysis of all of the data yields mass estimates for the X-ray\nsource and companion star of 14 and 60 times the mass of the Sun,\nrespectively. Our determination of M33 X-7's large mass establishes that\nthe X-ray source is a black hole, since the mass of any other collapsed\nobject, such as a neutron or quark star, cannot exceed about 3 Sun\nmasses.\n\nThe confirmation of the presence of a black hole in M33 X-7 is exciting\nfor a number of reasons. This is the only known eclipsing binary that\ncontains a black hole, and the presence of eclipses opens up new\npossibilities for exploring the properties of black holes. Furthermore,\nthis is one of the most massive black-hole remnants of stellar collapse\nthat have been discovered to date. In addition, the companion star in\nM33 X-7 is the most massive companion star in an X-ray binary, making\nthis system central to the study of the evolution of X-ray binaries and\nof massive stars themselves. It is also notable that the determination\nof a precise mass for M33 X-7 at a distance that is 100 times that of\nMilky-Way black holes marks a breakthrough in observational capability.\nFinally, with the distance to the source and the mass of the black hole\nknown, and using the exquisite Chandra X-ray data, my collaborators and\nI are in the process of measuring the spin of this black hole. Since a\nblack hole is completely defined by just two numbers that specify its\nmass and spin (we know of nothing else this simple except for an\nelectron or a quark!), the measurement of M33 X-7's spin will provide us\nwith a complete description of this distant black hole.\nin extreme conditions."}

Follow @universetoday on Twitter\n\nDistribution of redshifts and corresponding age of the Universe for gamma-ray bursts detected by NASA's Swift satellite. The new GRB 090423 at a redshift of z=8.2 easily broke the previous record for gamma-ray bursts, and also exceeds the highest redshift galaxy and quasar discovered to date, making it the most distant known object in the Universe. GRB 090423 exploded on the scene when the Universe was only 630 million years old, and its light has been travelling to us for over 13 billion years. Credit: Edo Berger (Harvard/CfA\n\nRed shift is a phenomenon that is the shift in the wavelength of light in the electromagnetic spectrum towards the \"red\" or infrared section. This is the result of wave mechanics, particularly the Doppler Effect. If you don't know what the Doppler Effect is, it's a theory describing the behavior of waves as their source moves away or toward an observer. The theory states that the closer the source of the waves to the observer the shorter the wavelength and frequency of the waves. The opposite also occurs as the source of the waves move away from the observer causing the wavelength of the waves to increase. This theory was first physically explained by Charles Andreas Doppler in 1842 concerning sound waves. It later tested and proven in 1845 by the Dutch scientist Christoph Ballot\n\nThe common example used in describing it is the fire engine siren. Most people have heard a siren on a fire truck and noticed that the pitch of the siren changes as the vehicle come towards them and as it leaves. Sound waves with shorter wavelengths sound higher in pitch while sound waves with longer wave lengths have a lower pitch. This is how we are able to know the Doppler Effect is occurring.\n\nThe theory also stated from the beginning that this phenomenon occurred for all types of waves. In astronomy it took the research of a man named Armand-Hippolyte-Louis Fizeau to prove that this phenomenon occurred in light as well. Light is also a kind a wave but the wavelengths are visible which gives us the visible spectrum. Fizeau proved it by separating the light from stars into their individual spectrum lines proving that red shift occurs.\n\nThis discovery allowed for other advances such as the calculations of stars' velocities. The theory also helped scientist compile evidence proving the expansion of the universe. The light of galaxies as well could be observed and analyzed to see if the light they emit in general produces the red shift effect. In the present time we use this also in spectroscopy the science of using light to determine the characteristics of a substance such as it elemental composition. Thanks to the Doppler Effect and light waves we now can not only determine, the distance and speed of celestial objects, we can also learn what they are made of even without the aid of probe. This theory has helped to advance astronomy and physics to our current understanding also helping to pave the way for other important theories like the Theory of Relativity."}

{"text": "Subscribe\n\nGiant star factory found in early galaxy\n\nA stellar factory millions of times larger than anything comparable in the Milky Way has been identified in a galaxy in the very early universe. The work bolsters the case that massive galaxies formed very quickly - in spectacular bursts of star formation - soon after the big bang.\n\nRegions of intense star formation, called starbursts, span a few light years at most in the Milky Way, and less than a few hundred light years in nearby, bright galaxies such as Arp 220 (pictured). But it has not been clear how large the stellar nurseries were in the early universe.\n\nTo find out, researchers led by Fabian Walter of the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Heidelberg, Germany, carefully scrutinised a distant galaxy whose light has taken so long to reach Earth that it appears as it was just 870 million years after the big bang.\n\nWarm dust\n\nIt is visible at such distances because it hosts a beacon-like quasar, a bright region created by superheated gas falling towards a colossal black hole at the galaxy's core.\n\nThe quasar, called J114816.64+525150.3, is so bright that it overwhelms the surrounding galaxy's light at visible and near-infrared wavelengths. But the galaxy's gas and warm dust can be detected at radio and far-infrared wavelengths.\n\nUsing an array of telescopes in the French Alps, the team measured the galaxy's ionised carbon, which emits a strong signal at far-infrared wavelengths. Far-infrared radiation is thought to be a signature of dust that has been heated up by nearby star formation.\n\nMaximum rate\n\nThe ionised carbon spanned a region at the heart of the galaxy about 5000 light years across. Based on the galaxy's brightness at far-infrared wavelengths, this starburst region is thought to produce an astounding 1000 Sun-like stars every year.\n\nThat is \"about 1000 times higher than the star-formation rate of the Milky Way\", says team member Chris Carilli, chief scientist at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in Socorro, New Mexico.\n\n\"It's forming stars at the maximal rate allowed . . . on scales that are 106 or 108 times larger in volume\" than similar regions in the Milky Way, he continues. \"That's remarkable.\"\n\nMerging galaxies?\n\nThe immense scale of the stellar factory is probably due to the fact that there was a lot more gas around in the early universe, Carilli says. Matter in the universe was indeed much denser soon after the big bang, since space itself has expanded over time.\n\nBut researchers don't know what ignited the star birth in the first place. Mergers between galaxies can trigger gas clouds to collapse into stars (and cause matter to fall into a galaxy's central black hole, turning on a quasar). However, it's not clear from the observations whether or not a merger was involved in this case.\n\nAn alternative theory, put forward recently by a team led by Avishai Dekel of Hebrew University, suggests that cold gas flowing into galaxies - in either smooth streams or clumps - may trigger starbursts. \"This may be an example of this phenomenon,\" Dekel told New Scientist.\n\nSudden and dramatic\n\nCarilli says gas may have fallen onto the galaxy over a long period of time, but some gravitational disturbance - perhaps a merger - must have suddenly kick-started its star birth. \"Empirically, what we're seeing is a pretty dramatic event,\" he says.\n\nThe discovery suggests massive galaxies like this one, which is a blob-shaped 'elliptical' rather than a spiral, \"form fairly quickly, relatively early in the universe\", says Carilli.\n\nIndeed, a similar process appears to have occurred in the Milky Way. The stars that form a bulge around its centre - essentially a miniature elliptical galaxy - all seem to have formed around the same time, in a starburst billions of years ago.\n\n'Pathological objects'\n\nBut Carilli says it's too soon to say whether all galaxies formed their stars so quickly, or whether some eked out stars slowly over time.\n\nThat's because only the heaviest, brightest objects can be seen at such distances. \"All we can study are 'pathological' objects - rare, extreme luminosity objects,\" he says. \"They don't really tell us about normal galaxy formation; they tell us about massive galaxy formation.\"\n\nA project called ALMA (Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array), which will be the world's largest array of millimetre-wave telescopes when it is completed in 2012, will shed light on more typical galaxies. It will be able to study objects 100 times less massive than can be detected with current telescopesStar Nurseries?\n\nWed Feb 04 21:27:25 GMT 2009 by Sergey\n\nIt is hard for me to simply take on word that stars are formed here... First gas does not condense to form stars: it dissipates outwards. Second, stars colliding to make a new star is not really forming stars anyway. Please give proof for the formation of stars.\n\nStar Nurseries?\n\nBlack Hole In The Knowledge!\n\nWed Feb 04 22:56:23 GMT 2009 by Slobodan\n\n\"A distant galaxy whose light has taken so long to reach Earth that it appears as it was just 870 million years after the big bang. It is visible at such distances because it hosts a beacon-like quasar, a bright region created by superheated gas falling towards a colossal black hole at the galaxy's core.\"\n\nSomething is wrong with standard Big Bang theory!\n\n1. How colossal big holes formed only 870 million years after Big Bang or maybe even earlier? Even super massive star life cycle is about few billion of years, averages stars, like our Sun, have a life span probably 10 billion of years, small stars, maybe 10 times that.\n\n2. What cause so fast collapses if the Universe expands rapidly after the Big Bang?\n\n4. What caused forming of colossal BHs at the very early time after Big Bang - if this theory is correct? Obviously it couldn't be collapse of super massive stars.\n\n5. Did?\n\nThat could mean that the space itself made a strong ripples in space, causing immediate collapses of condensed matter into gravitational centers, causing forming of primordial BHs that in second step started attracting matter in galaxy formations, burning up lights and newborn stars?\n\n6. Why we detect Carbon in primordial galaxies not older than few hundred million of years?\n\nMost of the heavy elements in the universe, such as carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen, are created by fusion in the centers of stars. Galaxies in the early universe had not had enough time to create all the heavy elements that exist now.\n\n7. How carbon appeared in so young and early Universe, if the average lifetime of star is from couple of billion to hundreds billion years and 870 million years old galaxy did not have enough time to create Carbon and heavier elements???\n\nStellar nurseries in early Universe are plausible, heavier elements and colossal black holes in very early Universe somehow do not fit the standard model.\n\nIf Universe was born (which I doubt seriously) 13.7 billion of years, our cosmology owns us a lot of answers on facts that do not fit standard model and Big Bang theory.\n\nBlack Hole In The Knowledge!\n\nBlack Hole In The Knowledge!\n\nThu Feb 05 11:33:42 GMT 2009 by Slobodan\n\nYes, I know all those blah, blah, blah, that is the reason I am questioning here, all those blah simply do not fit standard cosmology model and our scientists have to fight hard to imagine and create new theories, or hypothesis to include incoming data that do not fit standard theory into standard theory. It is a kind of circular logic that fundamentally cannot be true.\n\nPeteR: What is about time? Time will slowdown, according to our measurements and Relativity theory, it will not run faster in order to speed up burnout of stars and collapsing into black holes.\n\nAnd even the Time Relativity is questionable. Is the time slowdown in presence of large mass (gravity) or just energy wave oscillations slowdown, influenced by gravity? Do our atomic clocks on Earth slowdown compared to those on orbits because of time slowing on Earth, or oscillations (frequencies), which we use to reference the time, shift to lower frequencies due to gravity pull?\n\nIs the time or energy oscillations slowing down, causing us to perceive it as time dilatation?\n\nIs the red shift caused only by speeding up galaxies due to expansion of Universe, or electromagnetic waves slow down their oscillations in presence of large mass on their way from very distant parts of Universe, shifting thus to red?\n\nMaybe the red shift is caused by second, so we actually cannot use it for measuring distances in Universe, since it could be caused by both effects - moving of galaxies as well as slowing down oscillations due to gravity pull through vast space filled with enermous quantities of matter?\n\nBlack Hole In The Knowledge!\n\nThu Feb 05 13:08:43 GMT 2009 by Slobodan\n\nIn addition to my previous reply, I must add that I am really doubtful about noticed redshift as Doppler Redshift caused by receding galaxies or expanding space causing stretching of light waves. That means that all estimations about distances in our Universe based on redshift would be redefined and reconsidered.\n\nWhat I had in mind as possible alternative is: energy loss proportional to traveled distance = frequency reduction per traveled distance =redshift proportional to traveled distance and all of this correlated to overall mass in the traveled path could be only one among a number of explanations. This is contrary to opinion that Hubble's redshift prop. to expansion speed, by Doppler effect or redshift caused by stretching light waves due to expansion if space..\n\nRed shift is not continuous. It is quantized at a rate of approximately 8km/s.\n\nThis sort of series of jumps in the redshift measurements has been recorded. It would be expected that they should be like a car when it is accelerating: showing a smooth series of measurements. But this is evidently not what the data is showing. It is for this reason that the assumption of an expanding universe based on redshift measurements may be false. Could the universe expand in jumps?\n\nBack to the article now: observations were made on galaxy born some 870 million years after Big Bang - that means it is old something less than 13 billion of years right?\n\nBut, how this age was estimated? By measuring red shift of the galaxy, which shows us it's distance? Is is a real distance? What if Doppler' shift didn't cause measured redshift? Maybe it was the influence of overall matter / gravity pull on the light wave path from the galaxy to us? What is the real distance / age in this viewpoint?\n\nAnd finally - what is TIME? Time simply could show not to be a fundamental dimension constituting so-called space-time. Time could be simply a way we catalog a series of otherwise unrelated events. If no events/changes occurred, there could be no time. In this viewpoint time is not fundamental dimension, it is only a relation to universal motion. If you can imagine absolutely still Universe in which there are no movement at all, in which even subatomic particles do not move there are no energies as well because without oscillations there are no energies - can you tell me what is the TIME?\n\nNo motion - no energy - no time. Time is just an attribute of universal motion.\n\nBlack Hole In The Knowledge!\n\n1. \"Even super massive star life cycle is about few billion of years, averages stars, like our Sun, have a life span probably 10 billion of years, small stars, maybe 10 times that.\"\n\nWRONG. Stars that are sufficiently massive to produce core-collapse supernovae (above about 4 solar masses) remain on the Main Sequence for LESS THAN 20 MILLION years. Stars of 25 solar masses last only 5 million years - only 1/1000 as long as a 1.1 solar mass star! Stars even more massive live even shorter periods of time, under a million years for stars over 100 solar masses. 870 million years IS entirely sufficient to contain multiple generations of massive stars - on the order of 100 generations! Supernovae are the chief means of synthesizing heavy elements and dispersing them back into the interstellar medium, while stars under 3 or 4 solar masses never so much as synthesize any elements heavier than carbon before they quietly settle into a white dwarf where such carbon is sequestered (in most cases) permanently (unless they acquire more mass than 1.4 solar masses, in which case they detonate as Type Ia supernovae). Therefore all the lesser-mass stars are almost completely irrelevant to the issue. And how do \"colossal big holes form only 870 million years after the Big Bang or maybe even earlier?\" SIMPLE! Many current models show that's more than adequate time for supermassive black holes to form. Gravitational collapse of high-density regions of the intergalactic medium as part of the initial protogalactic growth was rampant during the early universe because the average density of the proimordial medium was far higher than it is currently. These models show that supermassive black hole growth was already well underway within the first 100 million years. The first black holes, according to these models, already existed by the first 10 million years! Naturally, confirmation by observation will prove exceedingly difficult, since we are forced to examine redshifts of Z greater than 100.\n\nYou ask:\n\n2. \"What cause so fast collapses if the Universe expands rapidly after the Big Bang?\"\n\nSimple. Localized high-density regions of the primordial medium DON'T expand like the universe at the large scale does. Why? Because gravitation retards and prevents such expansion, and will induce the highest-density regions to CONTRACT.\n\nBlack Hole In The Knowledge!\n\n4. \"What caused forming of colossal BHs at the very early time after Big Bang - if this theory is correct? Obviously it couldn't be collapse of super massive stars.\"\n\nObviously you don't know what you are talking about. It's been well demonstrated ever since 1964 (Iben and independently, Feynman) that the \"super-star\" hypothesis introduced by Hoyle and Fowler the year before to explain quasar energy output (that is, with masses between a thousand and a billion solar masses) doesn't work because such massive amounts of matter are inherently unstable and inevitably collapse to form black holes in a very short time. Even after continued and strenuous theoretical efforts throughout the sixties to find ways of \"propping them up\" against their self-gravitation, via a variety of mechanisms, including fast-rotating massive disks, turbulence, nuclear reactions, magnetic fields and even ad hoc exotic fields, and sophisticated models that often combined these and other dynamic effects in the form of magnetized spinning superstars or disks dubbed \"spinars\" or \"magnetoids\", NONE of them were found to be stable. By the turn of the decade (Bardeen & Wagoner, 1969 and Salpeter & Wagoner, 1971 and Woltjer, 1971 and others) the conclusion was inescapable: all such superstar models unstable and evolve too rapidly to explain the sustained output observed in quasars. All these mechanisms were unequivocally shown to be inadequate to prevent instability and collapse into black holes.\n\nYou incoherently pose:\n\n5. \"Did?\" [sic]\n\nYES! They CAN have! Why shouldn't gravitational agglomeration be SIMULTANEOUSLY capable of leading to BOTH star formation AND critical densities leading to collapse? What makes you think that a region containing a sufficient amount of matter to bring it within its gravitational radius (or event horizon) could be resisted by internal pressures and temperatures, however intense? A homogenous supermassive parcel of hydrogen gas (say, a billion solar masses) can easily collapse within its event horizon without any part of it ever having acheived densities or pressures necessary to initiate thermonuclear fusion reactions. The average density of such \"colossal\" black holes is IN FACT surprisingly LOW. But if in the real universe the same parcel of gas should contract and produce a compact star cluster, IT MATTERS NOT IN THE SLIGHTEST that the individual members of a cluster produce a pressure to halt their individual collapse: THE STAR CLUSTER AS A WHOLE WOULD INEVITABLY COLLAPSE WITHIN ITS EVEN HORIZON.\n\nBlack Hole In The Knowledge!\n\n6. \"Why we detect Carbon in primordial galaxies not older than few hundred million of years?\"\n\nSimple. Because core-collapse supernovae that produce the carbon are a result of massive stars that live only between 1 to 20 million years.\n\nYou declare:\n\n\"Most of the heavy elements in the universe, such as carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen, are created by fusion in the centers of stars. Galaxies in the early universe had not had enough time to create all the heavy elements that exist now.\"\n\nThat's totally untrue. Most heavy elements were created by MASSIVE stars. Galaxies in the early universe in fact DID have plenty of time to create all these heavy elements. Therefore it is even more clear that all the heavy elements that \"exist now\" had plenty of time SINCE then to have been synthesized by even MORE generations of massive stars.\n\nYou repeat yourself a third time:\n\n7. \"How carbon appeared in so young and early Universe, if the average lifetime of star is from couple of billion to hundreds billion years and 870 million years old galaxy did not have enough time to create Carbon and heavier elements???\"\n\nFirst, the \"average age\" of stars has absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with it! The \"average\" age of stars, if weighted to their relative abundances by mass, would be well over 100 billion years! It matters NOT AT ALL however! The vast majority of stars are low-mass of M-Type red dwarfs, which can last on the Main Sequence for TRILLIONS of years! THOUSANDS OF BILLIONS OF YEARS! But they never produce any elements heavier than helium, and even if they were ever given a chance to finish their lives (don't hold your breath!) almost none of their product is broadcast back into the interstellar medium. Stars of the Sun's mass and below (K and G-Type stars) are hardly any more productive: they live roughly from tens to hundreds of billions of years, and none of them are capable of synthesizing carbon either! Stars above the mass of the Sun but not massive enough to complete fusion reactions leading to core-collapse (with masses roughly between 1.2 and 3 or 4 solar masses, comprising the spectral classes F and A-Types) may synthesize nuclei SHORT of Nickel 56 (or the eventual product isotope Iron 56, for A-Type stars approaching 4 solar masses) but are incapable of exploding them all back into the interstellar medium, although Red Giant phases of these stars can and do often relatively gently cast off their outer layers that contain carbon dust. You need stars of Type B and O - stars above about 4 solar masses - to reach nucleosynthesis of Iron and therefore supernovahood. THESE are the stars that efficiently cast their heavier element products back into the interstellar space. Stars between about 4 and 8 solar masses produce neutron star remnants, but stars heavier than 8 solar masses almost invariably leave \"stellar mass black holes\".\n\nBlack Hole In The Knowledge!\n\n\"Stellar nurseries in early Universe are plausible, heavier elements and colossal black holes in very early Universe somehow do not fit the standard model.\"\n\nSomehow? As I've outlined above, maybe it's because you have a completely wrong idea of what the \"standard model\" is.\n\nYou add:\n\n\"If Universe was born (which I doubt seriously) 13.7 billion of years, our cosmology owns us a lot of answers on facts that do not fit standard model and Big Bang theory.\"\n\nWell, in case you didn't realize it, science or nature does not care a whit what anybody believes or may \"doubt seriously\". It's obviously up to science to figure out what nature is up to. We can't rest comfortably on our cozy notions and opinions of what's going on, refuse to make any effort to understand what science actually HAS learned thus far about nature, then offer such laughably mistaken opinions as serious arguments about why the scientific consensus doesn't conform to your standards of coherence.\n\nSolution: READ SOME GOOD TEXTBOOKS ON ASTROPHYSICS AND COSMOLOGY....BEFORE you speak up pretending to understand anything.\n\n\n\n1, Universe was CREATED form singularity (nothing) in a rapid creation of time and space, followed by very rapid inflation of space that probably flatten all initial curvatures in primordial space\n\nProofs? NONE.\n\n2. Inflated Universe continue to expand after initial inflation followed by cooling of \"soup of primordial energies, that lead to condensation of subatomic particles, that with progressive cool down start to form particles which continue to expand with expansion of Universe.\n\nProofs? NONE!\n\n3. Condensed matter started to collect about local gravitation centers due to its own mass, opposing expansion of space, thus forming \"islands\" of matter in a vast space, like fractals, that lead to primordial galaxy formations and whatever else (primordial BHs, colossal BHs in Galaxy centers etc.). All further hypotheses and calculations are based on such premises.\n\nWhen you experts measure spectral lines, object mass, temperatures, chemical composition, relative speeds and distances, average stars life rate, etc., you are using the best scientific knowledge, and no one can oppose what you really get as ultimate evidences.\n\nWhen you experts start to imagine the ultimate truth, Universe origin, you are not astronomy experts anymore, you are rather metaphysicists. You are talking about something unconfirmed, not testable, beyond perception barrier.\n\nWhat proofs you have about Big Bang, except some observations that initially fit to this theory? NONE.\n\nCREATION! Universe was created from singularity, time and space was created at the moment of Big Bang. Nothing existed before it since eve the time didn't exist? Is it a science or philosophy, metaphysics, religion?\n\nI am sorry I have to tell you experts, (since I am and ordinary mortal BScEE), that those hypotheses are not more plausible than those which stated that the Earth was flat, or that the Earth is a center of the Universe.\n\nWhen you found Universe is expanding, you tried to calculate it. You??\n\nThen you put everything in computer simulations and extensive mathematical tools, which confirmed your Imaginary Universe. Starting from unexplainable origin and newborn theory which does not fit exactly with observations, inventing new imaginary stuff just to make mathematics work, you use mathematical results and simulations as proofs for your initial premises.\n\nYou may call it science, I call it CIRCULAR LOGIC.\n\n.\n\nWhen you talk about Cosmology, you are not on scientific field anymore, you are in the field of philosophy, religion and metaphysics and you have no more rights to knock others that do not feel, believe, or think like you. A lot of your, so called knowledge, is based in premises that could be opposed sooner or later. Knowing hypotheses and unconfirmed theories are not knowledge- it is a guess. If you, dear expert, would really like to understand the Universe, you should first wait quantum physicists to give you answers what is matter, energy, vacuum, gravity etc. Without understanding of quantum physics there is no ultimate understanding of cosmology.\n\n.\n\nBut when you start swearing on Hubble, Einstein, ranting about creation form nothing, red.\n\nBlack Hole In The Knowledge!\n\nAlthough you do not like my note - in addition to my previous post, I will add it here and continue.\n\n1. Red Shit, Hubble law, gravitational redshift, cosmological redshift... well a lot of particular cases used at convenience to measure distance in Universe.\n\nBut, is recessional velocity the only thing that can produce a redshift? You are trying to keep my mouth shut, I am not reputable astronomer, right, then please refer to a reputable astronomer Mr. Halton Arp \n\nYou can even write to him asking him to keep his mouth shut.He has a different opinion about red shift as recessional speed measure.\n\nSome quasars may be double stars, with one member being an ordinary star and the other exhibiting a large red shift and being labeled as a quasar. The 100,000th Hubble Image is a good candidate for such a pair. Ken Kellerman of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory has also suggested that the red shift of quasars may be intrinsic and not an indication of their distance in a classic 1972 paper Radio Galaxies, Quasars and Cosmology published in the Astronomical Journal.\n\nQuasars, according to their red shift are the most distance objects, right? If quasars are so distant they will not show proper motions.\n\n\n\nThanks for your patience, next time before open your mouth to knock somebody, shamelessly doubting his knowledge, please refer to thousands of alternate theories pages and think twice.\n\nBlack Hole In The Knowledge!\n\nMon Feb 09 06:32:59 GMT 2009 by anonymous\n\nPART 1\n\nLet's review your \"review\".\n\nIt is not surprising that you \"don't understand\" my Part 2 reply. You are mistaken in almost everything. Yet you MUST understand enough to say, in the same breath, that i'm \"not opposing\" you there, and color it a confirmation of what you say.\n\nAt least I'm an expert SOMETHING, sir - in Astronomy, yes, which is indubitably pertinent. And your expertise is in...have you figured that one out yet?\n\nThere is no such thing as a \"Standard Big Bang Theory\" of the kind you harbor in your head. The conclusion of the Big Bang comes about from three simple considerations: The first is that observations show that the universe is EXPANDING, indicating that the universe was smaller in the past. Run time back sufficiently far, and one cannot escape the conclusion that the universe had an explosive beginning at a finite point in the past. This is a simple, logical and inescapable deduction. There is nothing mysterious about it and there isn't anything outrageous about the implications. It's what nature says. The other consideration is that - before the expansion of the universe was revealed by Edwin Hubble and others in the 1920's - Einstein's General Theory of Relativity (GR) predicted that the universe must be dynamically expanding or contracting: a static universe was not a stable solution, which is why Einstein forced a \"Cosmological Term\" representing a repulsive force onto it. The third consideration is another OBSERVATION: the discovery and measurement (in 1964) of the 2.7 K temperature of the Cosmic Background Radiation that pervades the observable universe from our viewpoint. This TOO was PREDICTED by GR the previous year - on the assumption\n\nSurely you do not you imagine that the universe should be discovered to be expanding only AFTER the theory predicted it, AND that a completely different line of evidence - from a measurement of a background temperature completely consistent with a hot Big Bang, is all a mere coincidence?\n\nLet's get this tedious business over with:\n\nYou state:\n\n1. \"Universe was CREATED form singularity (nothing) in a rapid creation of time and space, followed by very rapid inflation of space that probably flatten all initial curvatures in primordial space. Proofs? NONE.\"\n\nNeither do you have any \"proofs\" that this HYPOTHESIS is grievously mistaken. Show us. Where are your counter-proofs? I see NONE.\n\n\"Standard Theory\" says absolutely nothing whatsoever about what a singularity can or can't do. NOBODY KNOWS. Everyone who knows about the subject, unlike you, realizes this. What the \"standard theory\" CAN and DOES address - and very effectively - is the primordial conditions that prevailed at very early times AFTER the initial singularity. These theoretical studies, employing both quantum theory (QT) as well as GR have consistently shown how space-time, matter, energy, forces and fields have emerged. Every step fits right in, there are no major glaring sore thumbs sticking out anywhere, and we are suitably confident we have the general picture right because we observe confirmation of it - such as the abundance of helium and deuterium calculated from the theory during primordial nucleosynthesis of hydrogen nuclei. The 2.7 K Cosmic Background Radiation is another confirmation that we are on the right track in understanding AT LEAST WHAT HAPPENED AFTER THE INITIAL SINGULARITY.\n\nYou declare:\n\n2. \"Inflated Universe continue to expand after initial inflation followed by cooling of \"soup of primordial energies, that lead to condensation of subatomic particles, that with progressive cool down start to form particles which continue to expand with expansion of Universe. Proofs? NONE!\"\n\nOh please. Don't you bother to read ANY research at all? Can't you make just a teensy-weensy effort to comprehend what cosmologists and astrophysicists have established through observational confirmation? Let me help you get started. PROOF: Observed increase in redshift with distance: Conclusion, the universe is expanding, exactly as GR predicted. Check. PROOF: Observed relative abundances of hydrogen, helium and deuterium conform excellently with the calculated estimates derived from studies of primordial nucleosynthesis using the Standard Model (of QT!) as well as GR. Check. PROOF: Observed Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (CMB) with a characteristic temperature and wavelength curve beautifully consistent with a hot era in the past (which is highly redshifted) and which was also predicted by the same theoretical considerations, to an astonishing degree of accuracy - an accomplishment that cosmologists are rightly proud of. Check. PROOF: observed mass-density distribution in the CMB that is consistent with an initial inflationary period which smoothed out density fluctuations to just the pattern predicted by the theory. Check.\n\nBlack Hole In The Knowledge!\n\nMon Feb 09 06:40:54 GMT 2009 by anonymous\n\nPART 2:\n\nI could go on - there are MANY other \"proofs\", and tons more circumstantial evidence which ALL paint a single coherent and consistent picture. But I don't suppose you will bother to read about them. Your argument is based entirely on the fact that you like to be contrary, and that's about it.\n\nI'm going to skip over much of the rest of the ludicrous claims you make, and only pick out a few of the juiciest, since they more clearly demonstrate that you do not know what you are talking about.\n\nLike this gem, for example:\n\n\"When you experts measure spectral lines, object mass, temperatures, chemical composition, relative speeds and distances, average stars life rate, etc., you are using the best scientific knowledge, and no one can oppose what you really get as ultimate evidences.\"\n\nPray, enlighten us all, dear All-Knowing Sage and Protector of Wisdom, what constitutes this \"ultimate evidences\" of yours. What is that?\n\nAnd this:\n\n\"What proofs you have about Big Bang, except some observations that initially fit to this theory? NONE.\"\n\nNone that you recognize, that much is laughably clear.\n\nAnd this:\n\n\"CREATION! Universe was created from singularity, time and space was created at the moment of Big Bang. Nothing existed before it since eve the time didn't exist? Is it a science or philosophy, metaphysics, religion?\"\n\nNone of the above. REAL scientists (you know, real EXPERTS?) know very well how to shrug their shoulders and say, \"Hmmm, that's weird. I don't know what's going on.\" But at least they have the courage and fortitude to make an attempt to find out and try to understand. You? You don't even understand that you DON'T understand, or WHY you don't understand. You're just a mess.\n\nAnd this:\n\n\"I am sorry I have to tell you experts, (since I am and ordinary mortal BScEE)...\"\n\nWell, it certainly appears that your \"ordinary mortal BScEE\" status makes you think you \"have to tell [us] experts\" about how wrong we are. As if a LACK of expertise was a legitimate qualification to judge expertise. I will give you high marks for making us laugh. That is SOME achievement, I suppose.\n\nAnd this:\n\n\"When you found Universe is expanding, you tried to calculate it.\"\n\nNo. That's not true. The theory (GR) predicted it and the calculation was performed BEFORE it was confirmed by observation. See, this is an example of why people who don't understand what they are talking about should keep their trap shut and make an attempt to listen to people who may know a great deal more about a field than they do.\n\nMore:\n\n\"You??\"\n\nWhat the heck do you want from scientists? You want them to know everything to begin with. Except they don't, and none of us ever claim to. But YOU think they do, or think they SHOULD. Then when they discover anything new and appropriately attempt to accommodate new findings within their models, you cry \"GOTCHA!\" and ridicule us for not knowing everything in the first place.\n\nAnd the whole time you don't understand a GNAT about what you are talking about.\n\nMore:\n\n\"You may call it science, I call it CIRCULAR LOGIC.\"\n\nThat's a very amusing charge, coming from one who is utterly DIZZY with it himself.\n\n\".\"\n\nI GUESS that you have never ever heard of deductive logic and self-consistent lines of reasoning and the testing of hypotheses against rigorous theoretical arguments as well as the ultimate verdict of nature through empirical experiment and observation. We CAN'T measure or \"estimate the age of Universe, distances, relative speeds, total mass, energy and other facts\"? Are you serious? We \"even do not know how much dimensions [the universe] has?\" We don't? So far, we are absolutely positively certain that there are at least 3 spatial and 1 time dimension. You care to dispute this? There may be more. Some models require more. We just do not know yet. You care to dispute THAT? If there are any more dimensions to be discovered besides the 4 that are absolutely, positively so far known about, we'll get back to you. Science isn't a cheap parlor guessing-game, chum.\n\nYour argument is basically this: \"I don't understand a DAMNED THING, and this qualifies me as an expert.\"\n\nBlack Hole In The Knowledge!\n\nMon Feb 09 06:44:29 GMT 2009 by anonymous\n\nPART 3:\n\n\"When you talk about Cosmology, you are not on scientific field anymore, you are in the field of philosophy, religion and metaphysics and you have no more rights to knock others that do not feel, believe, or think like you.\"\n\nThat's not true. When I talk about cosmology, I am referring to a SCIENCE. Why? Because, as one expert in the field once noted: \"It's impossible to do General Relativity WITHOUT doing cosmology\". GR has been confirmed by nature to a spectacular degree of precision. If that's not science I'll eat this computer.\n\nDo we have the \"rights to knock others that do not feel, believe, or think like you.\" Oh, absolutely! Do you think it is unfair to point out that you were mistaken in your assertion that massive stars live for \"a few billion years\"? That you were mistaken in thinking that all stars synthesize heavy elements and recycle them back into the interstellar medium? That you were wrong to claim that there wasn't enough time in 870 million years to produce the observed presence of carbon in the medium? That it is unfair of me to point out error after error, mistake after mistake, because people ought to have the freedom to speak on issues even when they are factually wrong? Does it hurt your feelings if anybody points out you are mistaken? Do you feel insecure about it? Here's a field you missed in your list of \"philosophy, religion and metaphysics\": how about psychology? Or maybe even psychiatry?\n\nAnd this:\n\n\"If you, dear expert, would really like to understand the Universe, you should first wait quantum physicists to give you answers what is matter, energy, vacuum, gravity etc. Without understanding of quantum physics there is no ultimate understanding of cosmology.\"\n\nAnd you, dear ignoramus, of course understand quantum physics, don't you? Or, at least, you are \"waiting for quantum physicists to give you the answers\" before you pass judgment on whether anybody in science understands everything as clearly as you do.\n\nI'M a \"quantum physicist\". AND a cosmologist, who feels very much at home in GR as well as quantum mechanics. In cosmology, you see, we have no choice but to treat quantum mechanics relativistically. Or didn't you know that? Of course not. How silly of me. You already know everything BECAUSE you know so precious little. I forgot how that works with you. So I guess you'll have to wait for me to give you the answers, as you say. Too bad you haven't been listening or making any attempt to comprehend anything I've said so far. Of course, you will have to wait a very very long time indeed before you get any \"ultimate understanding of cosmology\" out of me or any of my colleagues. Isn't that terrible?\n\nThis one is my favorite:\n\n\".\"\n\nNo, your general knowledge is resoundingly atrocious. No, you really DO have a BASIC LACK OF KNOWLEDGE, PRECISELY AS I SAID. And it is astounding that while you can admit that \"of course my ignorance is even wider [and] I cannot deny it\" this ignorance entitles you to tell experts they are full of it. You are \"just refusing to blindly accept interpretations and unconfirmed theories as the starting point for deeper understanding\", but you remain stubbornly blind to the fact that your idea of \"interpretations and unconfirmed theories\" are utterly mistaken. And why CAN'T any \"interpretations and unconfirmed theories\" BE the starting point to a deeper understanding? Where do you propose to place a starting point - in stubbornness, ignorance and a refusal to accept elementary principles, real evidence and established facts? Is that any foundation to build a starting point?\n\nI'm glad you \"won't argue\" with me \"about a method of measuring planet mass by measuring wobbling of a home star.\" That diversion would be tedious indeed, I'm sure.\n\nAnd this:\n\n\"But when you start swearing on Hubble, Einstein, ranting about creation form nothing,...\"\n\nUm, EXCUSE ME? I am \"ranting\" because i comprehensively examine your long and tedious overtures? I am \"ranting\" about \"creation from nothing\"? Show me where I said that. Show me where I \"swear\" Hubble or Einstein ever said this. Show me. You cannot. Why? Because it isn't there. Why do you claim it is there? Because you obviously haven't actually READ my comments. You just skimmed over it, presumed I was \"ranting\", and make false claims about it's content based on pure whim.\n\nBlack Hole In The Knowledge!\n\nMon Feb 09 06:48:56 GMT 2009 by anonymous\n\nPART 4:\n\nYou go on, thinking to mine out all of the words you find offensive - you know, the words i used to correct your errors, the words that signify scientific facts, the words that accurately convey the science, which you do not understand:\n\n\"...red.\"\n\nI never ONCE mentioned the word \"multiverse\". I never ONCE mentioned \"wormholes\". I never ONCE mentioned \"holographic universes\". I never ONCE mentioned any \"not confirmable BS\". You must indeed be blind.\n\nAnd no, you cannot \"argue against this with equal strength and arguments as you can use to defend your standpoints\" in any other way other than in the sense that a Big Mouth satisfies itself it is making an \"argument\" because it makes a great noise.\n\nYou follow up your incessant baloney, asking, quite rhetorically:\n\n\"But, is recessional velocity the only thing that can produce a redshift?\"\n\nWell, slobo, if you knew anything about GR, then you would already KNOW that my colleagues and I would immediately answer \"SURE!\" There really IS such a thing as gravitational red shift. It's been OBSERVED. MANY MANY TIMES OVER, CONFIRMED. And, if you knew the most elementary principles of cosmology, you would already KNOW that we find a consistent match between red shift with distance, and that whatever departures from smoothness in the expansion is entirely explainable by the independent motions of galaxies which are superimposed over the general expansion.\n\nBut, see, there's the problem: you DON'T know. You know almost nothing, and you are proud of it.\n\nWhat we do NOT find is any spectral shifts that are inconsistent with the velocity of recession of a source carried by overall expansion of the universe. Halton Arp first suggested in the early 1970's that he had found significant numbers of \"discordant red-shifts (those that could not be completely explained by recession: he did NOT pretend to say ALL red-shifts were caused by something else, such as gravitational acceleration of dense compact objects). In every \"bizarre\" case of a discordant red-shift he could find, it eventually turned out to be a chance alignment between a foreground galaxy and a background galaxy or quasar, often distorted and amplified by gravitational lensing, or just plain mistaken because of uncertainties produced by the relatively insensitive ground-based data Arp had to work with at the time. This is all now ANCIENT astronomical history. Arp is a kind of tragic figure in astronomy, often dismissed as a gadfly, but he was not ungifted and his proposal was certainly not dismissed out of hand by his colleagues without a very careful examination. This is virtue you may adopt.\n\nYou go on foaming at the mouth:\n\n\"[link to paper you do not understand]...or any of 30 other alternative redshift theories explanations and data reports. Which one you will trust? Can you dear expert claim ultimately that you can calculate distances and age of distant galaxies according to standard model only?\"\n\nYes. Within a reasonable error range, absolutely. Done. We do it ALL THE TIME. It's ROUTINE. It works. Every time we get a calculated result, it is consistent with completely independent criteria. But when you ask me which of \"30 other alternative redshift theories explanations and data reports\" I would \"trust\"? None. I do not trust ANY theory. I'm a scientist. I'm not allowed to trust any idea as \"ultimate\" and I have no regrets whatsoever that I shall; never ever achieve an \"ultimate understanding\" such as you require.\n\nBlack Hole In The Knowledge!\n\nMon Feb 09 06:52:24 GMT 2009 by anonymous\n\nPART 5 of 5:\n\nYou rattle on for quite a bit more, then invite me to \"shut the mouths\" of my colleagues:\n\n\" Thanks for your patience, next time before open your mouth to knock somebody, shamelessly doubting his knowledge, please refer to thousands of alternate theories pages and think twice.\"\n\nWe don't think twice, sir. We think OVER AND OVER AND OVER. And then we think some more. We ALWAYS endeavor to look under every stone to find an \"alternative theory\" (as you prefer to distinguish them) that does as good or a better job than others (such as the \"standard model\", which you so completely misidentify and keep insisting is something completely different from what it actually is).\n\nWhat makes you think we don't? What makes you think we aren't expending every effort to improve - or, if possible, supplant - the \"standard model\" which, by the way, addresses particle physics through BOTH quantum and relativistic considerations. The \"alternatives\" you refer to so far are ALL given a chance to prove themselves better at describing the data. If they DON'T, we toss them. If they are as good as what we know works best so far, we don't necessarily adopt it just because it may be different, but we remain very suspicious if it isn't as simple and elegant as what we already have. We are apt to toss them out if they are not. If an alternative flies forward on gleaming wings and alights upon our minds as a magnificent and elegant generalization that simplifies or even more accurately describes nature than what we have, then by golly we'll grab it up.\n\nI restricted my comments to General Relativity, which VERY VERY SUCCESFULLY describes gravity as a curvature of space-time, because it was clear from what you stated that you had not an inkling of what it is about. NONE. ZILCH.\n\nInstead of reading what I said, and attempting to accommodate it into your knowledge (such as it is) you chose instead to have a cow. A GREAT BIG ONE.\n\nThe history of science is defined by such major revolutionary stepping stones: The Copernican revolution dethroning the conceited centrality of humans. The Newtonian revolution uniting force with mass and acceleration, and the motions of objects under the influence of gravity. The Darwinian revolution describing the evolution of species through natural selection. The Maxwellian revolution unifying electricity and magnetism. The Einsteinian revolution of Special and General Relativity, as well as quantum mechanics and cosmology. Take your pick. Look between them. There are COUNTLESS strides, small and large, between each of these\n\nI don't have to argue with my colleagues over what you fantasize are differences between my viewpoint and theirs. Don't you understand ANYTHING? You aren't arguing from their point of view. I AM arguing from their point of view. Every single reputable scientist would unhesitatingly agree that your understanding of physics is dismal, and while not all of them would support my attempts to enlighten you, none of them would disagree that my responses are specifically aimed at your misunderstandings, not as statements intended for polite, general consumption, as yours are not either. You see? We have an \"argument\". A \"dispute\". This is okay and totally legitimate. It's between what YOU think and what I think. I can only rely on established facts and scientific evidence to support my counter-arguments against your statements. You, on the other hand, are free to roam throughout the far vaster realm of irrationality, fantasy, error and mistaken notion, to your heart's content, in order to lob up your arguments.\n\nI bat them down, you have a cow.\n\nThis is the behavior of a brat, not somebody who really wishes to understand anything.\n\nMost of all? Like almost every one of my colleagues, to the very last one of them, they also share with me a pet aversion: I can't STAND crackpots who do not know what they are talking about either. And the louder they get, the more we can't stand it. Eventually, something's got to give.\n\nMany of us prefer to try to ignore them. Most of us have tried valiantly. A brave few of us may be somewhat foolish not to (and without a doubt it eats into our time) but somebody has finally, at long last, got to stand up and challenge this growing scourge of flaky thinking, or we shall all soon be incapable of ignoring them at all.\n\nGo on. Yap on. You have no idea how foolish you appear. This would of course be entirely consistent with the premise that you do not know what you are talking about.\n\nThe heart of the nearby galaxy Arp 220, shown in this Hubble image, is bursting with star birth.

Thousands of these \"time bombs\" could be scattered throughout our Galaxy.\n\n\"We haven't found one of these 'time bomb' stars yet in the Milky Way, but this research suggests that we've been looking for the wrong signs. Our work points to a new way of searching for supernova precursors,\" said astrophysicist Rosanne Di Stefano of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics (CfA).\n\nThe specific type of stellar explosion Di Stefano and her colleagues studied is called a Type Ia supernova. It occurs when an old, compact star known as a white dwarf destabilizes.\n\nA white dwarf is a stellar remnant that has ceased nuclear fusion. It typically can weigh up to 1.4 times as much as our Sun - a figure called the Chandrasekhar mass after the astronomer who first calculated it. Any heavier, and gravity overwhelms the forces supporting the white dwarf, compacting it and igniting runaway nuclear fusion that blows the star apart.\n\nThere are two possible ways for a white dwarf to exceed the Chandrasekhar mass and explode as a Type Ia supernova. It can accrete gas from a donor star, or two white dwarfs can collide. Most astronomers favor the first scenario as the more likely explanation. But we would expect to see certain signs if the theory is correct, and we don't for most Type Ia supernovae."}
{"text": "Can you be more precise? 3, 5, 10 billion light years? I know we have detected galaxies at over 13 billion light years, but I assume those have a much higher surface brightness or perhaps high output in the UV which gets red shifted.\n\nIf you'd be willing to take an answer to a similar question:\nHow far could M31 and M33 be and still be detected by our instruments, you might get a more precise set of numbers. One is larger than us, one is smaller, but both are within an order of magnitude. Both have been observed by Galex and other probes, so we have nice data about their UV surface brightnesses. We could probably answer that with some limited amount of work. The Milky Way's integrated brightness at various wavelengths might be harder to look up.Wow, you are seriously trashing that D&L paper. Have you directly challenged the authors to respond to your criticisms?\n\nI'm a bit left in the dark here. It's hard to understand how these estimates can be so far apart unless some important assumptions are different, such as how does Z relate to expected dimming.\n\nI haven't looked at Nereid's thread. But when I read the first post\nin this thread, my thought was that it probably couldn't be pinned\ndown to better than a factor of two. I'm the least knowledgeable\nperson on this subject to reply so far, though.\n\nThe Milky Way and Andromeda are both quite large, massive\ngalaxies, because they are old and are the result of mergers of\nmany smaller galaxies over billions of years. Any galaxies that\nwe can see at great distances will necessarily be younger. They\ncould be brighter, though, if they went through a period of intense\nstar formation while they were young.\n\nAlso, \"nearby\" distances -- millions of light-years -- are fairly\nstraightforward to compare. Cosmological distances -- billions\nof light-years -- not so much. Comparing the brightness of a\ngalaxy six billion light-years away to that of one twelve billion\nlight-years away would likely be daunting for me.\n\nStated differently, with current instruments, at what distance would a galaxy like our own probably not be detected?

The SDSS is a survey with what is now a medium-sized telescope BUT it is looking at a large fraction of the sky with relatively short exposures, and catches lots of galaxies. Your question seemed more to do with if there were lots of such mature galaxies, how far away could we see them by chance in deep images such as the Hubble Ultra Deep Field, or deep images collected in the near infrared by the VLT. That z value would probably be larger than 1.0 and might be closer to the 4 or 5 we've seen above, but I don't have a figure to give you for it.\n\nWow, you are seriously trashing that D&L paper. Have you directly challenged the authors to respond to your criticisms?\n\nNo.\n\nBut then I don't think I have to, considering ... well, let me just say that, when you get to the last page of that thread (p8), I reference an interesting paper.\n\nI'm a bit left in the dark here. It's hard to understand how these estimates can be so far apart unless some important assumptions are different,\n\nYes, the assumptions used are very important. That's partly why I asked you to clarify your question (in the OP).\n\nsuch as how does Z relate to expected dimming.\n\nWhat Disney and Lang do (or rather, claim to do) is put a galaxy somewhat like our own (the Milky Way) at various distances (redshifts) and estimate whether it could be detected or not. They use two kinds of \"detection\" - could the galaxy be 'seen' as an extended source? and could the galaxy be 'seen' as a point source?\n\nRedshift (z) affects the former via observed surface brightness (which goes as (1+z)^4) ), while how the latter varies with z is a bit more complicated.OK, but I think that's a highly restrictive assumption.\n\nConsider AGNs (active galactic nuclei): our galaxy does not, today, have an AGN; however, per our current understanding, it certainly did in the past, possibly as recently as a few million years ago. And its nucleus certainly was active many times before that*. Nearly a decade ago now Chandra stared at a small field in the constellation Bo\u00f7tes for a while, and found lots of point sources (and a few extended sources). Many of these turned out to be AGN, some at very high redshift. Optical counterparts for some of the x-ray sources were not found. Is it possible that one of such sources may have been a distant Milky Way, with its SMBH+accretion disk 'on'?\n\nNow suppose an x-ray survey is done, with Chandra staring at a small field for much longer. For sure, many more point sources will be detected (some caveats apply), and perhaps some will be just like our galaxy, at a considerably greater distance. As luck would have it, here is a recent report of just such a deeper x-ray survey.That's a lot more precise, and so the answer to your question can be too.\n\nOf course, you say \"with some confidence\" but also \"definitely\"!\n\nYou also say \"light\"; do you mean \"electromagnetic radiation, in the region ~400-700 nm\" (i.e. the 'visual' or 'optical')? Or do you mean any part, or parts, of the entire electromagnetic spectrum?The key point the Disney and Lang paper makes is not so much the luminosity (brightness) one, but the surface brightness one: at extreme distances, our galaxy's apparent surface brightness is too low for it to be detectedI'll address this part of your post later; stay tuned!\n\n* true, the 'duty cycle' - as it is called - of the SMBH (super-massive black hole), and its accretion disk, at the centre of the nucleus of galaxies like ours is not well understood, but they do seem to have been 'on' more than once in their lives\n\nRedshift (z) affects the former via observed surface brightness (which goes as (1+z)^4) ), while how the latter varies with z is a bit more complicated I suppose Z goes to infinity at BB T0? I must have some misconception about the distances in an expanding Universe or something. In Ned Wright's calculator I'm taking the light travel time as the measure of distance.\n\n1 + Z is the wavelength ratio (emitted/received) of a given spectral line, correct? Strange that Z was defined that way, instead of simply as the ratio.\n\nAs luck would have it, here is a recent report of just such a deeper x-ray survey. The HST optical images clearly show \"normal\" galaxies at 1 Z, but I have no idea if those galaxies are comparable to our own in luminosity.\n\nBTW I guess the X-ray detections of AGN are relatively insensitive to the orientation of the jets? Otherwise wouldn't it be possible that the \"normal\" galaxies detected are actually AGN at unfavorable viewing angles?\n\nOriginally Posted by NereidOK, so let's make it a bit more precise. Detection will be defined to mean that the source can be resolved as extended and that a spectral line can be measured to get Z. That's what I would like to consider as confident identification.\n\nLet's put it another way, if there were lots of galaxies like our own at the time they emitted the light that reaches us now, at what maximum distance would we be well aware of their existence.\n\nIn a later post, you moved a very long way from this as the key criterion!\n\nAs you discovered, 'being aware of the existence' of something, and being able to convince yourself of its similarity to something else, are two very different questions (or goals).\n\nThe purpose - well, one purpose - of my 'x-ray papers and post' was to illustrate that you could very well 'be aware of' a galaxy much like a (somewhat) earlier/younger version of our galaxy (i.e. one with an active nucleus) without knowing, with any degree of certainty, that it is, in fact, a Milky Way sibling.\n\nI realize this is a theoretical question because of the assumptions about dimming and dust, so I'm asking in the context of mainstream LCMD theory formulas.\n\nI don't know how dust entered your considerations; perhaps you were concerned that a galaxy like ours, viewed sideways (so that the disk appears edge-on) might be very much dimmer (in that narrow band, ~400-700 nm) than the same galaxy viewed face on.\n\nCan you explain why you thought this important, please?\n\nSoIt's from the Fathi et al. paper I indirectly mentioned (I did some rounding), in an earlier post; have you read it yet?\n\nOh, and is there are particular reason you write \"Z\" for redshift, instead of the usual convention (\"z\")It's what you can readily observe; converting it to a distance depends on the cosmological model you choose to use, and the values of the parameters in that model.\n\nIt also depends upon the definition of distance you're using, e.g. luminosity distance, radar distance, etc. Which one have you chosen?The answer to that question is a definite \"maybe\"!\n\nIt depends, heavily, on things like what you mean by \"galaxies like our own (as it currently is)\" and \"detect\".\n\nBut we've moved on since your wrote these words; time for me to do so tooYes it is.\n\nAnd, given how much of that other thread you've no doubt read by now, you have begun to appreciate some of the limitations of D&L's approach. Yes?\n\nQuite astonishing how General Relativity works, isn't it?\n\nYet it's a very well tested theory, with nothing even remotely in sight to challenge it.\n\nI suppose Z goes to infinity at BB T0? must have some misconception about the distances in an expanding Universe or something. In Ned Wright's calculator I'm taking the light travel time as the measure of distance.\n\nWhy choose this kind of distance, rather than any other?\n\n1 + Z is the wavelength ratio (emitted/received) of a given spectral line, correct? Strange that Z was defined that way, instead of simply as the ratio.But you spoiled the fun, by changing your criteria before I could get hereThe HST optical images clearly show \"normal\" galaxies at 1 Z, but I have no idea if those galaxies are comparable to our own in luminosity.BTW I guess the X-ray detections of AGN are relatively insensitive to the orientation of the jets? Otherwise wouldn't it be possible that the \"normal\" galaxies detected are actually AGN at unfavorable viewing angles?\n\nAs I understand it, spiral galaxy AGNs rarely, if ever, have jets. Certainly not ones visible in the x-ray part of the spectrum.\n\nThe source of x-rays, in most AGNs, is the accretion disk, and the immediate surroundings (by reflection). In principle, you'd expect accretion disk orientation - relative to us - would matter a lot (in terms of observed x-ray intensity); I do not know if, in fact, it does.\n\nOK, so let's make it a bit more precise. Detection will be defined to mean that the source can be resolved as extended\n\nGood. In the local group, there are three classical spirals: M31, our galaxy, and M33. They differ considerably in size and estimated total luminosity. They also differ - considerably - in many other ways (e.g. M31 apparently has far more globular clusters than our galaxy does, and M33's globular clusters seem to have a very different range of ages than those of either M31 or our own galaxy).\n\nand that a spectral line can be measured to get Z.\n\nEmission or absorption? Or you don't care?\n\nAnd if there's only one, how do you know which one it is? If you make a mistake, you'll get the estimated z completely wrong, won't you?\n\nThat's what I would like to consider as confident identification.\n\nAssuming the redshift is confident (by some magic), wouldn't that simply result in you having identified an extended source, of redshift z? How would you know it's even a galaxy?Originally Posted by NereidOriginally Posted by NereidOriginally Posted by NereidOriginally Posted by NereidOriginally Posted by NereidOriginally Posted by NereidThe images vary from z~0.08 to 1.2. All were made with what I'm guessing are visible band filters (B435, V606, and z850). I cannot find the absolute magnitudes in the paper.

So now, I do wonder what it would look like (imaged identically) at z~1.2!\n\nOriginally Posted by NereidNo offense please, but why should I care? Isn't surface brightness more useful to talk about.

Certainly not ones visible in the x-ray part of the spectrum.\n\nThat's interesting and something I was not aware of. What sort of galaxies are found with jets then? Are AGNs and quasars thought to be the same phenomenon, the result of central SMBHs in galaxies?\n\nOriginally Posted by Nereid\n\nIn this, I think we are in much agreement. The various sorts of detection discussed don't necessary tell us that much detail about what we have detected at cosmic distances. Again I think this is the whole point of the D&L paper. I'm not sure I see the basis for your severe criticism. I guess I could read that thread again but it really lost me in the details.\n\nOriginally Posted by Nereid\n\nEmission or absorption? Or you don't care?\n\nDefinitely emission, who knows where the absorbing medium is relative to the emitter? Of course you could also argue about re-emission but that seems much less likely to be a problem.\n\nOriginally Posted by Nereid\n\nAnd if there's only one, how do you know which one it is? If you make a mistake, you'll get the estimated z completely wrong, won't you?\n\nYou are a stickler, but of course you would need many more lines to identify the elemental source of any measured line.\n\nOriginally Posted by Nereid\n\nAssuming the redshift is confident (by some magic), wouldn't that simply result in you having identified an extended source, of redshift z? How would you know it's even a galaxy?\n\nYou are continuing to make the D&L paper's point! Why did you get so upset about it?\n(I wasn't aware that magic was required to be confident about a red-shift. Are you referring to my failure to mention the need for multiple lines?)\n\nI'm very interested in what you can tell me about the above very specific question about an HST image of M31 at z~1.2* I tried to post the two images, but got a strange error message, so you'll have to click on the link to see how dramatically different the two images, of the same galaxy, are.\n** it is obvious to you, isn't it?\n\nI mentioned dust in reference to intergalactic dust which affects brightness and color of background galaxies.\n\nAs far as I know, there are very few reports of the confident detection of intergalactic dust ... once you get out to ~5 effective radii for most spirals, the sky is quite clear. There are some exceptions - near the centre of rich clusters, possibly in various streams, and in tidal tails (a result of close encounters of the galactic kind). The IGM (inter-galactic medium) does certainly contain metals, but none of it in the form of dust.\n\nPerhaps you were thinking of the ISM (interstellar medium)? If not, could you give some references please?\n\nZ versus z - oops, but you got it anyway.\n\nIt seems that in this era of \"precision cosmology\" one should take conclusions about the galactic population at z ~> 0.15 with a large grain of salt.\n\nOne should always take broad, over-simplified conclusions with a truckload of salt!\n\nGalaxies are fascinating astronomical objects; on the one hand they seem so simple, yet when you start to examine them in detail, they turn out to be amazingly complicated. Fortunately, astronomers being (in general) especially fond of paying a lot of attention to detail, conclusions they draw (in the papers they publish) come with more than enough detail to enable you, the reader, to estimate just how much salt you need to take.\n\nI do wish the astronomical community would be more modest about what they think they know.\n\nMost of this post is scene-setting, making sure we're on the same page, that sort of thing ...\n\nOriginally Posted by TooMany\n\nOriginally Posted by NereidGood, especially the part about making doubly sure you're comparing apples with applies (so to speak).Discussion of this would take us too far from this thread, but if DM poses a problem for GR, it poses an equally daunting problem for the weak field limit we call Newtonian gravity (e.g. spiral galaxy rotation curves).Thus reinforcing the point that converting an observation of a redshift to an estimate of a distance is 'model dependent', as they say ...I think it depends on what you're trying to do, with the question you asked.\n\nIf your aim has something to do with galaxy evolution, then perhaps the best distance to use would be one that you could easily use to relate observations to 'age since photons streamed free' (i.e. when the universe ceased being radiation dominated). But as you have stated that you are explicitly interested in what the Milky Way would look like if it were a distance x from us, then perhaps a better measuring rod would be redshift (z)?Good; my point was that conventions sometimes do not seem to make much sense, when you are new to a field of scienceWhich is getting us much closer to what it is, exactly, that you think makes the Milky Way unique.\n\nAnd here we run into a completely different kind of challenge: what, exactly, does our own galaxy look like? As we're at a location close to the disk plane, ~10 kpc from the nucleus, it's actually very difficult to say, with a reasonable degree of confidence, what our homegalaxy looks like, from M31, say.\n\nTo get around this, how about we change the question in the OP to \"How close must a galaxy like M31 be to clearly detect?\" and \"Stated differently, with current instruments, at what distance would a galaxy like M31 probably not be detected?\"\n\nIf we use a GRB as a back-light, then detecting an M31 look-alike could be as simple as finding a set of absorption lines in its spectrum, at a fixed z, and with the characteristics of M31's ISM (a certain metallicity, and temperature). A bright quasar could serve in place of a GRB, giving the added benefit of repeat observations using different instruments over many years. In this way, an M31 look-alike could be detected to a redshift just shy of that of the GRB or quasar.\n\nIn emission, we could add up the light detected from the distant M31 look-alike, across as many wavelengths as possible*, and plot the integrated intensity against wavelength (or frequency). This would give us a SED (spectral energy distribution, or density); if we have a z, we can convert this to absolute units (assuming isotropic emission). We could then compare that with the (suitably redshifted) observed SED of M31 (taking care to ensure we integrate over the entire observed extent of M31, which is far from trivial to do). For this we do not need to 'resolve' the distant galaxy, although having it \"... be detected in minimally four connected pixels, each at \u2265 0.75\u03c3 above the local computed sky-background\" would be helpful**OK, so this is worth exploring further then.\n\nOn the question of what \"current instruments\" (per the OP) are capable of, is it OK to include what facilities such as LOFAR and the SKAwill be capable of, once they are up and running (and assuming they achieve their design objectives)?\n\n* as the distant galaxy will be faint, the points may have to be integrated over a 'broad band', such as SDSS' r.\n** see p8 of the Bias effects in galaxy detection threadI recall some years ago HST images of deep objects were interpreted as irregular, unformed galaxies. I think this interpretation was later discarded. The above example demonstrates how form can be misinterpreted in faint images.\n\nThat helps answer my question(s). Interesting that the authors don't highlight how this population might substantially differ from the current population. The featured conclusion is that the merger theory of large galaxy formation is probably wrong. However they do mention star formation rates as much higher. This makes me wonder how star formation rates can be measured.\n\nInteresting that the authors don't highlight how this population might substantially differ from the current population.\n\nIt's not my experience that much useful can be inferred from whether an individual research paper stresses or even mentions something or not. This is even more the case for something like CANDELS where the results will be appearing over perhaps dozens of papers over a span of years.\n\nThis makes me wonder how star formation rates can be measured.\n\nOptical and UV color, luminosity in emission lines (especially recombination lines), radio emission... it seems that the (emitted) optical and near-infrared bands are the only ones in which we easily see stellar populations other than quite young ones.

Quasars are the brilliant beacons of light that are powered by black holes feasting on captured material, and in the process, heating some of the matter to millions of degrees. Credit: NASA/ESA/Yale\n\nBlack holes in the early universe needed a few snacks rather than one giant meal to fuel their quasars and help them grow, according to observations from NASA's Spitzer and Hubble space telescopes.\n\nQuasars are the brilliant beacons of light powered by black holes feasting on captured material, and in the process, heating some of the matter to millions of degrees. The brightest quasars reside in galaxies distorted by collisions with other galaxies. These encounters send lots of gas and dust into the gravitational whirlpool of hungry black holes.\n\nNow, however, astronomers are uncovering an underlying population of fainter quasars that thrive in normal-looking spiral galaxies. They are triggered by black holes snacking on such tasty treats as a batch of gas or the occasional small satellite galaxy.\n\nA census of 30 quasar host galaxies conducted with two of NASA's premier observatories, Hubble and Spitzer, has found that 26 of the host galaxies bear no telltale signs of collisions with neighbors, such as distorted shapes. Only one galaxy in the sample shows evidence of an interaction with another galaxy. The galaxies existed roughly 8\u201312 billion years ago, during a peak epoch of black-hole growth.\n\nThe study, led by Kevin Schawinski of Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut, bolsters evidence that the growth of most massive black holes in the early universe was fueled by small long-term events rather than dramatic short-term major mergers.\n\n\"Quasars that are products of galaxy collisions are very bright,\" Schawinski said. \"The objects we looked at in this study are the more typical quasars \u2014 they're a lot less luminous. The brilliant quasars born of galaxy mergers get all the attention because they are so bright and their host galaxies are so messed up. But the typical bread-and-butter quasars are actually where most of the black-hole growth is happening. They are the norm, and they don't need the drama of a collision to shine.\"\n\nFor his study, Schawinski analyzed galaxies observed by the Spitzer and Hubble telescopes in the Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey. He chose 30 dust-enshrouded galaxies that appeared extremely bright in infrared images taken by Spitzer, a sign that their resident black holes are feasting on surrounding material. The dust is blocking the quasar's light at visible wavelengths, but infrared light pierces the dust, allowing Schawinski to study the galaxies' detailed structure. The masses of those galaxies are comparable to that of our Milky Way.\n\nSchawinski then studied the galaxies in near-infrared images taken by Hubble's Wide Field Camera 3. Hubble's sharp images allowed careful analysis of galaxy shapes, which would be significantly distorted if major galaxy mergers had taken place and were disrupting the structure. Instead, in all but one instance, the galaxies show no such disruption.\n\nWhatever process is stoking the quasars, it's below the detection capability of even Hubble. \"I think it's a combination of processes, such as random stirring of gas, supernovae blasts, swallowing of small bodies, and streams of gas and stars feeding material into the nucleus,\" Schawinski said.\n\nA black hole doesn't need much gas to satisfy its hunger and turn on a quasar. \"There's more than enough gas within a few light-years from the center of our Milky Way to turn it into a quasar,\" Schawinski said. \"It just doesn't happen. But it could happen if one of those small clouds of gas ran into the black hole. Random motions and stirrings inside the galaxy would channel gas into the black hole. Ten billion years ago, those random motions were more common and there was more gas to go around. Small galaxies also were more abundant and were swallowed up by larger galaxies.\"\n\nThe galaxies in Schawinski's study are prime targets for NASA's upcoming James Webb Space Telescope, a large infrared observatory scheduled to launch later this decade. \"To get to the heart of what kinds of events are powering the quasars in these galaxies, we need the Webb telescope. Hubble and Spitzer have been the trailblazers for finding them.\"\n\nWithin a billion light-years of earth, a hundred galaxy super clusters reside:\n\n\n\nThat space density (a hundred per cubic giga light-year) is similar to the observed space density of Quasars. Inexpertly, Quasars reflect major mergers, occurring in crowded clusters of galaxies. As this article states:\n\n\"The brightest quasars reside in galaxies distorted by collisions with other galaxies. These encounters send lots of gas and dust into the gravitational whirlpool of hungry black holes.\"\n\nPerhaps the infrared excess seen in these Spiral galaxies derives from shrouded star-formation, rather than (unseen) faint Quasars ? Outside of crowded clusters, Spiral galaxies are the most numerous kind of large galaxy. But, only a few in a million galaxies ever generates a Quasar: astronomers observe ~30 Quasars per square degree of sky, implying ~1 million Quasars all-sky; but, extrapolating from the Hubble \"Deep Field\" series of extended exposures, there are hundreds of billions of large galaxies all-sky. Inexpertly, i understand that Quasars derive from super elliptical cD galaxies, residing in the centers of busy super clusters of galaxies, having assembled there from major mergers, some of which generated powerful Quasars.\n\nSubmitted: 11/21/2012 1:12:45"}

In the image below you can see the turquoise disk of the planet has a bright 'blotch'.\n\nUranus' Aurorae Credit:NASA, ESA, and L. Lamy\n\nAn aurora is produced when a stream of charged particles from the solar wind (the material ejected from the Sun) collides with a planet's magnetic field (more properly called its magnetosphere) and excites the particles within the atmosphere casing them to glow. This glow is what we observe as the aurora.\n\nOn Earth aurorae with a blue or red colour are due to excited nitrogen, whilst green or a redish brown hue is due to excited oxygen. The aurorae can dance across the sky in waves of coloured light and whilst some last for a few brief minutes others can remain active for hours depending on the conditions creating them \u2013 solar storms for example can create very powerful aurorae.\n\nAurorae have been observed on other planets as well, particularly Jupiter and Saturn; both of which have prominent auroral systems. Those present in Uranus' atmosphere are considerably fainter and appear to last only for a few short minutes at a time.\n\nThese images represent the first observation of Uranus aurorae, with previous data collected directly during the Voyager 2 flyby in 1986.\n\nThese new observations should help to reveal more about Uranus' magnetic field, which we currently know little about.\n\nThe region is a nebula composed mainly of hydrogen and it is using this hydrogen to create new stars of all masses.\n\nNot long ago, (by astronomical terms of course!) the nebula would have been cold and dark as the newly forming stars had yet to break out of their gaseous progenitors. The most massive and thus hottest newborn stars have now blasted through the clouds of dust and gas that surrounded them, subjecting the surrounding nebula to a fierce stream of ultraviolet radiation that is eroding the larger structure and making it fluoresce in response. This fluorescence makes the nebula an emission nebula as it is emitting its own light rather than just reflecting that of the stars it contains.\n\nAnalysis of the data indicates that the majority of this radiation comes from one star. It is the bright star visible near the centre of the image.\n\nOnly the largest stars have currently emerged from their nurseries with many smaller, perhaps more sun like stars remain hidden within their denser pockets of the nebula.\n\nNGC 2467 is like many other star forming regions including the more famous Orion Nebula. NGC 2467 is located around 13,000 light years from Earth with the Orion Nebula around 10,000 light years away.\n\nThe Nebula is located in the constellation Puppis which is completely visible to residents of the southern hemisphere (those in the northern hemisphere can observe the northern section of the constellation however it sits close to the horizon)\n\nThe image is a combination of several taken with the HST's Wide Field Channel in several filters.

{"text": "X-ray map of the central region of the Milky Way. This map shows a region along the galactic plane with an area of 500 light-years by 100 light-years. The galactic center exists in the white portion near the center of the image, and the red-dotted line is the high-temperature plasma sphere. The green ellipsoid is a supernova remnant, and the blue circle is the molecular cloud. The black regions have not yet been observed.\n\nMolecular cloud of Sagittarius B, observed by ASCA in 1994 (left) and by Suzaku in 2005 (right).\n\nAt the center of the Milky Way, the galaxy that's home to our planet, there is a black hole that is a few million times the mass of the Sun and is currently considered to be in a dormant state. Also, stars are being formed near the center of the galaxy, and these activities are observed by electromagnetic waves of various wavelengths, such as radio waves, X-rays and gamma rays. Suzaku confirmed from the precise observations of X-ray spectra emitted from the highly-ionized ions of heavy elements such as iron that the X-ray emission from a spherical region with a radius of about 500 light-years is coming from plasma with a temperature of 70 million degrees. This suggests that even today stars formed by active star formation cause a lot of supernova explosions and emit a large amount of heavy elements into space. In the center of the Milky Way, there are still many undiscovered supernova remnants, and it's possible that the supernova explosions that created these remnants were the energy sources of the high-temperature plasma.\nSuzaku has also observed a neutral iron emission line from the central region of the galaxy, and one from a molecular cloud 300 light-years away from the galactic center. A molecular cloud is an aggregation of gases and cosmic-dust particles, and because its temperature is low, normally the iron atoms it contains do not emit X-rays. However, when the molecular cloud is irradiated from the outside with strong X-rays, it emits characteristic X-rays of is own. Suzaku's X-ray image of the molecular cloud called Sagittarius-B appears different from the image obtained by the X-ray astronomy satellite ASCA about ten years ago. If we suppose that the strong X-rays irradiating the molecular cloud come from the black hole at the center of the galaxy, it is possible that the wave front of the X-ray flare passed very close to this molecular cloud. In other words, the black hole at the center of the Milky Way was active just 300 years ago.\n\nCosmic rays are high-energy charged particles, mainly protons, that fly around in space at nearly the speed of light, and bombard the Earth at every moment. Ever since cosmic rays were discovered at the beginning of the twentieth century, scientists have wondered from where they come how they are accelerated. Suzaku's observations have given us some important clues. One was obtained through the observation of supernova remnant RX J1713-3946, together with the observation with the NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory. This celestial body emits not only X-rays but also ultrahigh-energy gamma rays, and it's the gamma rays that attracted our attention.\nFirst, the Chandra X-ray observatory, which has exceptional spatial resolution, captured X-rays whose intensity varied among 2000, 2005 and 2006 observations, namely on time scale of just one year, which is a very short time in astrophysics. , This corresponds to seeing the behavior of charged particles when they are gaining energy (accelerating) and losing energy (cooling). This was the first time we had captured the acceleration phenomena of the cosmic rays directly. On the other hand, Suzaku measured X-ray spectra up 40 keV (kilo electron volt), revealing that X-ray intensities rapidly decrease from near 10 keV. The fact that the X-ray spectra extend up to such a high energy shows that electrons are also accelerated effectively. By combining the observation results of two satellites, it becomes clear that cosmic rays consisting primarily of protons are created and accelerated by means of the shock wave of the supernova remnant.\n\nAn X-ray image of supernova remnant RX J1713-3946 observed by Chandra. There are regions whose X-ray intensity varies on time scale of about a year. (reproduced from Uchiyama et al., Nature 2007)\n\nX-rays generated near the Earth. X-rays are emitted through the charge exchange reaction between the ionized ions in the solar wind and the neutral matter. (the background picture by: NASA, CXC, M. Weiss)\n\nElectromagnetic waves of various lengths float in the universe, causing the entire sky to glow almost homogeneously. This is called cosmic background radiation. In the 1990s, the German satellite ROSAT found a phenomenon where the intensity of X-rays increased by a factor of two or more in the course of about one day, during the observation of soft X-ray cosmic background radiation. At that time, people could not find any parameters correlating with the X-ray intensity, and didn't have the faintest idea of where that radiation was coming from. Thanks to the discovery in 1996 of X-ray emissions from a comet, we have had to consider the possibility that X-rays can be emitted by a process which was considered not to be so important previously. When highly ionized ions in the solar wind interact with the neutral matter in the comet atmosphere, X-rays are emitted.\nSuzaku detected that increase of X-ray intensity during the observation of background radiation, and obtained a firm evidence that its origin is the solar wind. We studied how the X-ray spectrum changes when the intensity of the radiation increases. Suzaku's observations detected a characteristic X-ray that is emitted by the interaction of highly ionized ions and neutral matter by means of charge exchange when the X-ray intensity is increased. In the charge exchange reaction an electron moves from the neutral matter to the ionized ions, leaving the ions in exited states. Exited ions emits X-ray line emissions characteristics of the reaction. Suzaku found that the emission comes from an altitude of about 6000 km from Earth surface. We consider that the completely ionized carbon ions and highly ionized oxygen ions in the solar wind penetrate from the magnetic pole of the Earth into a 6000-km altitude, and emit X-rays by the charge exchange reaction with the hydrogen atoms existing there.\nThis reaction occurs not only in near-Earth regions and near comets, but also in other places in the solar system. For example, in the aurora of Jupiter, the X-rays generated by the charge exchange of ionized ions in the solar wind are observed. Suzaku also observes Jupiter and other planets, and studies in detail what kinds of X-rays are emitted from Jupiter."}

It's spinning at almost the speed of light.</p>\n<p>The galaxy in question is called NGC 1365, which is about twice the size of the Milky Way and located about 60 million light years away. The black hole is about 2 million times more massive than the sun. Scientists using NuSTAR and the European Space Agency's XMM-Newton satellite wanted to measure how fast it is spinning.

To measure them, you have to measure their effect on their surroundings--like the X-rays emitted by dying matter. This is hard to do because objects between us and them can get in the way, however, making the X-rays look distorted. There have been two competing models explaining why the X-rays look warped: Either gravitational distortion caused by black hole gravity, or distortion caused by intervening clouds of gas and dust.</p>\n<p>In this new study, NuSTAR and XMM-Newton set out to determine which one is right. The telescopes carefully traced the X-rays emitted at the very, very edge of the black hole, right near the event horizon, or the point of no return.

The story: Powerful crime organizations in the late 21st century can't off their foes without getting caught, so they illegally send victims back in time to the year 2044 to be disposed of by hitmen called \"loopers.\" <em>Looper</em>'s time travel, in short, is a futuristic version of the East River.</p>\n<p>Though gunning down folks from the future is profitable, it comes at steep personal cost. Thirty years after Joe the looper (played by both Bruce Willis and Joseph Gordon-Levitt with some Bruce-Willis-like makeup) signs up, crime bosses nab him, send him into the past, and force his past self to kill his future self -- an attempt to close his \"loop.\" This is the standard for loopers: live well, but live fast, and when your time comes, your younger self will be your killer. (Nothing could possibly go wrong with this scenario, nor introduce a series of mind-melting time travel paradoxes, right? Oh, wait.)</p>\n<p>Moviemakers often turn to scientists to boost the plausibility of their plots, even when the plot involves a drug-addicted time-traveling hitman, but Johnson says he didn't consult with any researchers while making <em>Looper</em>.</p>\n<p>\"The science of real life time travel was less important than the science of using time travel in a story,\" Johnson wrote in an email to Popular Science. \"I studied other time travel movies to see how they put it at the service of the characters and story, and not the other way around.\" Johnson has previously cited <em>La Jet\u00e9e</em> as an influence, for example.</p>\n<p>But the movie got us thinking about where the science of time travel stands. So we spoke with <a href=\" target=\"_blank\">Edward Farhi</a>, a theoretical physicist at MIT who has both seen the movie and intimately studied time travel.</p>\n<h3>INTO THE FUTURE</h3>\n<p>One of time travel's best-known facts is that going forward -- way, way forward -- is technically possible. Albert Einstein realized this as early as 1905, when he deduced the special theory of relativity.</p>\n<p>\"Einstein argued time is not an ever-flowing and immutable thing, but that an interval of time between events depends on the observer,\" Farhi says. In short, the faster you travel compared to some other object, the slower your clock ticks relative to the other object's.</p>\n<p>For example, riding a rocket into space that's traveling close to light-speed -- then returning to Earth months or years later, according to your clock -- would elapse hundreds or even thousands of years on the planet. \"You may meet your children's children's children's children and be younger than them, and that's weird,\" Farhi says. \"But there's actually nothing paradoxical about this.\"</p>\n<p>Einstein later developed the general theory of relativity, which argues intense gravitational fields are another way to skip ahead in time. Hanging around a black hole's point-of-no-return, where gravity warps space-time, the fabric of the universe, to an extreme degree, could make someone's clock run far slower than that of an observer near the gravity well's edge.</p>\n<p>\"If I hung you down there and you looked up at me, you'd see me in fast-motion and I'd see you in slow-motion,\" Farhi says. \"That makes people wonder, could you build a gravity field strong enough to bend space-time to go backward? It's a pretty tempting idea.\"<br />\n</p>\n<h3>BACK TO THE PAST?</h3>\n<p><em>Looper</em> doesn't propel characters into the future, except through cinematic montage sequences. But the movie does transport people into the past. </p>\n<p>Farhi say most researchers discounted the possibility of backward time travel until the early 1990s, when astrophysicist J. Richard Gott published an intriguing study on theoretical warpings of spacetime called \"closed timelike curves.\" </p>\n<p>Gott solved for Einstein's equations in an imaginary 2-D universe to create the curves. Even accounting for the known laws of physics, <a href=\" target=\"_blank\">the solution seemed to allow backward time travel</a>.</p>\n<p>Skeptical of this on-paper feat, Farhi and two other physicists then posed the question: <a href=\" target=\"_blank\">what would it take to build this time machine</a>?</p>\n<p>The trio assumed they'd have infinite technology at their disposal, both to corral the necessary matter to warp 2-D space-time and fuel a spaceship to travel near the speed of light.</p>\n<p>\"In Gott's idealized universe, you could turn on the machine around [a dense piece of matter] and come back before you left,\" Farhi says.</p>\n<p>After crunching their equations, the implausibility of the machine became clear. To warp space-time enough to create a closed timelike curve as well as power the spaceship would demand half of the fake universe's matter and energy. (Farhi noted that a similarly ridiculous requirement would also extend to such a machine in our own universe.)</p>\n<p>That snag notwithstanding, theoretical physicist Gerard 't Hooft and his colleagues also pointed out that <a href=\" target=\"_blank\">the extreme density would collapse the universe in a big crunch</a> before the machine could begin to function.</p>\n<p>\"Einstein's theory of general relativity seems to conspire to end the universe before you're able to travel back in time and kill your grandfather before your parents were born,\" Farhi said. \"This convinced me that traveling back in time is not possible.\"<br />\n</p>\n<h3>TIME TRAVEL TODAY</h3>\n<p>Farhi has since moved on to study quantum computing, yet other ambitious researchers continue to probe the arrow of time. A group of researches in 2011, for example, suggested that <a href=\" target=\"_blank\">quantum particles can be entangled across time</a>, potentially allowing people to send data instantly into the future. Such a feat -- while impractical for now, as it may need to involve black holes to work -- might safeguard data important to humanity.</p>\n<p>Another potentially helpful development is the proposed existence of <a href=\" crystals</a>. Such perpetually vibrating molecules might be key to the universe's most reliable clocks. Even in the coldest depths of space, which can halt atomic movement, magnetic forces within a properly assembled crystal would keep its atoms moving.</p>\n<p>Most recently, physicists studying the decay of particles revealed that <a href=\" target=\"_blank\">time's preferred direction -- forward -- really isn't a fluke</a>.</p>\n<p>Although Farhi's work in 1992 convinced him that paradoxes will always prevent backward time travel, contrary to <em>Looper</em>'s worrisome depiction of the universe, he gave the possibility one last shot on May 7, 2005.</p>\n<p>\"The students [at MIT] decided to host a time traveler's convention. We advertised the event, put out milk and cookies for time travelers, and waited for some to show up. Maybe they were clever enough to remain incognito, but none came,\" Farhi says.</p>\n<p>\"So, as far as we know, reverse time travel can only exist in the movies.\"<br />\n</p>\n</div>ScienceDave Mosherblack holesmoviesphysicsspacetimetime travelThu, 27 Sep 2012 17:05:00 +0000Dave Mosher65489 at  From the Void\n<div class=\"center-image\"><img src=\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\"imagecache imagecache-article_image_large\" /><div><strong>Signals From the Void</strong> <em><p>Mark Garlick</p>\n</em></div></div><div>Scientists are trying to get the first direct look at the black hole at the center of our galaxy. How close will they come to seeing the unseeable?\n<!--paging_filter--><p>Even without a telescope, it's possible to look off the summit of Mauna Kea and see, 14,000 feet below and dozens of miles in the distance, wide swaths of rain forest touching the whitecapped Pacific. Down there, people are doing what people come to Hawaii to do: hiking to waterfalls, lying in the sand, exposing their skin to tropical solar radiation. Up here, there is no vegetation, no warmth and very little atmosphere. And as the sun sets over the parabolic aluminum dishes of the Submillimeter Array observatory, it's time to work.</p>\n<p>Sheperd Doeleman, the 45-year-old MIT researcher in charge of tonight's experiment, is setting up a piece of the radio telescope that, if all goes well, will synchronize with other radio telescopes in California and Arizona to observe matter on the verge of disappearing into a black hole. Doeleman and his counterparts on the mainland are using a technique called very long baseline interferometry to simulate a much larger instrument, which they call the Event Horizon Telescope. The longer the baseline, the higher the resolution, so these astronomers have for the past decade or so been hauling their delicate and expensive hand-built equipment to remote sites around the world, installing it anew for each observation. The work is highly improvisational, but to see what they want to see, there is no other way.</p>\n<p>Outside the Submillimeter Array's control-room windows, patches of snow speckle the summit. The storm that deposited them several days ago has since traveled 2,500 miles east, where it has been blocking all observation at the station in California, thus delaying the whole observing run. Things are going better tonight. Or at least they're starting to. \"It looks like we're actually recording something,\" Doeleman says. \"Which is nice.\"</p>\n<p>\"The Mark 5Bs are recording,\" says Nicolas Pradel, a post\u00addoctoral researcher from Taiwan's Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics. The Mark 5B recorders are connected to the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope next door, which is contributing its 15-meter dish to tonight's effort. \"The Mark 5Cs\"-the newest, highest-bandwidth recorders, and the ones hooked up to the Submillimeter Array-\"are not.\" </p>\n<p>Doeleman, a slight man with a runner's build, sprints out of the room and runs downstairs, where the recorders are installed. A few minutes later, he darts back into the control room, panting in the thin mountain air. He sits back down at his computer, pounds out a few keystrokes and mumbles something technical and reassuring to the postdocs and telescope operators. The recorders appear to be working black hole should cast a shadow. The goal is to capture an image of that shadow.</span>Three arrays is just a start. Doeleman and his cohort have been operating this same network of radio telescopes since 2007, when they pointed the array at the galactic center and detected \"structure on the event-horizon scale,\" a deeply obscured blip in space whose dimensions match the predicted size of <a href= \" A*</a> (pronounced \"A-star\"), the four-million-solar-mass black hole at the center of the Milky Way. After that, with encouragement from colleagues, Doeleman decided that peering deeper into the galactic center, deep enough to actually take a picture of the very edge of Sagittarius A*, was not as implausible as it sounds. Detectors were becoming more sensitive every year; data storage and processing power had never been so cheap. If he could add the right telescopes to his network, taking a picture of Sagittarius A* should be, as Doeleman puts it, \"eminently doable.\"</p>\n<p>Over the next few years, Doeleman says, he and his group will combine as many as a dozen of the world's most sophisticated radio-astronomy installations to create \"the biggest telescope in the history of humanity\"-a virtual dish the size of Earth, with 2,000 times the resolution of the Hubble Space Telescope. Tonight the Event Horizon Telescope astronomers have a more limited goal: They want to catch as much light from Sagittarius A* as possible and study its polarization to learn about the black hole's magnetic field. But eventually (if all goes well) astronomers using the fully scaled-up Event Horizon Telescope-a machine with resolution high enough to read the date on a quarter from 3,000 miles away-will see the silhouette of an object that is, in itself, unseeable.<dme:page/><br />\n<br />\nImmediately after Albert Einstein published his general theory of relativity in 1915, physicists began trying to figure out what his equations said about the actual operation of the universe. One of them was a German astrophysicist-turned-soldier named Karl Schwarzschild. Working from a trench during World War I, he found a way to calculate the curvature of space-time around a highly idealized, perfectly spherical star. He mailed his equations to Einstein, who presented them in Schwarzschild's stead at a January 1916 conference in Berlin. Four months later, Schwarzschild died of illness on the eastern front.</dme:page/></p>\n<p>Einstein was impressed by Schwarzschild's math, but he rejected one of his predictions-that a dense enough star would collapse under its own gravity into an infinitely small, infinitely dense point. Einstein insisted that some force of nature that Schwarzschild had ignored would prevent this implosion. The most prominent physicists of the era agreed with Einstein. Black holes, as we now call them, violated so many intuitive ideas about how the universe should work that they met with what the California Institute of Technology theorist Kip Thorne called \"widespread and almost universal 20th-century resistance.\"</p>\n<p>Yet in the following decades, physicists became increasingly convinced that Schwarzschild was right. In 1939 Robert Oppenheimer, the physicist who would later lead the Manhattan Project, built on Schwarzschild's work (plus two additional decades of research on general relativity) to develop the most persuasive case yet that certain stars, upon exhaustion of their nuclear fuel, would collapse under their own gravity. In the 1950s, using computer models coded to simulate the detonation of hydrogen bombs, both American and Soviet physicists independently generated the most sophisticated mathematical arguments yet that when sufficiently massive stars die, implosion is inevitable.</p>\n<p>In the 1960s astronomers started finding empirical evidence, however indirect, that black holes weren't merely mathematical constructs, but that they actually existed. Nothing but enormous black holes, for example, could power quasars-points of light, some of them at the edge of the observable universe, that shine with the luminosity of hundreds of galaxies. In the 1990s astronomers found that stars near the center of galaxies were orbiting at millions of miles per hour. Such speeds made sense only if those stars were orbiting black holes.</p>\n<p>Most physicists now accept the existence of black holes-regions of space where gravity becomes infinitely powerful, matter becomes infinitely dense, time freezes and light becomes trapped. Black holes come in two main varieties: stellar-mass holes, which remain after a star collapses, and supermassive ones, which scientists now say sit at the core of all galaxies. At the center of every black hole is a singularity, a point at which our understanding of the laws of physics breaks down. At the edge of every black hole is a boundary called the event horizon, which separates the hole from the rest of the universe. The event horizon is, as Doeleman says, \"a one-way membrane in space-time\" that leads to \"someplace causally distinct from where we are now.\" It's an exit door from the universe with a strict reentry policy: What passes through can never come back.</p>\n<p>No one has ever seen an event horizon, but they should be seeable. Theorists predict that the extreme warping of time and space around a black hole's event horizon should create a telltale shadow, a pitch-black circle surrounded by a blazing ring of light. The ultimate goal of the Event Horizon Telescope is to capture an image of that shadow.</p>\n<p>The project's success would make it possible to see how the theory of general relativity holds up at the edge of a black hole, the most extreme environment in the universe. It would also provide unequivocal evidence that black holes exist-something often taken for granted but not yet proven. \"Now we can ask the question,\" says Avery Broderick, a theorist at the University of Waterloo and an EHT collaborator. \"That really will motivate a discussion. There's no point arguing about how many angels can dance on the head of a pin until you can find an angel dancing on the head of a pin.\"</p>\n<p><center><strong>* * *</strong></center></p>\n<p>One hundred fifty thousand trillion miles from Mauna Kea, Sagittarius A* is spinning radiation into the cosmos. Electrons and ions that once belonged to dust clouds and stars orbit the black hole at nearly the speed of light, whirling around its 140-million-mile circumference once every 24 minutes and along the way throwing off radiation that spans the electromagnetic spectrum. A tiny fraction of the radiation that fled Sagittarius A* 26,000 years ago will tonight make its way to Earth. An even tinier fraction of that radiation will fall on the summit of Mauna Kea, some of it striking the collecting dishes of the mountain's radio-telescope antennas.</p>\n<p>If everything works properly, the collecting dishes will funnel the arriving radio waves into helium-cooled receivers, which will beam them to the control room through buried fiber-optic cables. The signals will be amplified, digitized and time-stamped by a <a href= \" maser</a>, a $300,000 air-conditioner-size atomic clock that loses only one second every 10 million years. Next, the signals will be recorded on 8-terabyte hard-drive packs, which the astronomers will then FedEx back to the EHT's \"lens\"-a supercomputer-powered correlator at MIT's Haystack Observatory outside Boston.</p>\n<p>At Haystack, a technician will take the data packs from all three sites involved in the observation-the Submillimeter Array and James Clerk Maxwell Telescope in Hawaii, the Combined Array for Research in Millimeter-wave Astronomy (CARMA) in California, and the Submillimeter Telescope (SMTO) in Arizona-and attempt to sort the signal from the noise. Despite being cooled to four degrees above absolute zero, telescope receivers produce a steady thrum of noise 100,000 times as powerful as the signal from the cosmos. \"Riding on top of the noise is a little bit of a signal that-except for a time difference and a bit of a frequency shift-is the same from station to station,\" explains Jonathan Weintroub, the astronomer and electrical engineer who is in charge of the EHT's instrumentation at the Submillimeter Array. \"The signal that is the same from station to station is the signal from the source.\"</p>\n<p>For maximum clarity, all of this has to work properly at every station. And at the Submillimeter Array, at least, everything does appear to be running properly. A little after 7 p.m., with the software cross-checked, the antennas phased up and the recorders finally working, the 12-hour observation sequence begins. Doeleman passes around a duffel bag filled with snacks from Trader Joe's. (\"You have to try the mission figs!\") I sit down next to Ryan Howie, a 20-something telescope operator who's been working at the Submillimeter Array since this group's first observations in 2007, and ask whether tonight's warm-up was abnormally chaotic. Not at all, he says. \"Things are actually going much more smoothly than they did on the first couple of runs.\"<dme:page/><br />\n<br />\nThe weather tonight is immaculate. To put it in radio astronomer-speak, the tau is 0.028. Tau is the central variable in the equation astronomers use to measure the obscuring effect of atmospheric water vapor. And even on this mountain, a spot chosen for its anomalously sweet average figures for tau, nights this clear come only 10 or 15 times a year. Weather like this, Doeleman says, is \"like being in space.\"</dme:page/></p>\n<p>The conditions at the other sites are far from ideal. The tau at CARMA is disturbingly high. The tau at SMTO is excellent, but so far, airborne ice crystals have prevented the telescope operators from opening the dome and exposing the satellite dish to the atmosphere. Passable weather at those sites will have to do, though. The snowstorms in California and Arizona over the past three days have forced Doeleman and crew to cede their telescope time to other astronomers and spend their nights brooding 5,000 feet below at Hale Pohaku, the dorm where astronomers sleep and eat and prepare for their observations.</p>\n<p>Tonight is the second-to-last chance the Event Horizon Telescope will have this year to do its work. Telescope time is a scarce resource; the time-allocation committees at the various observatories have given Doeleman and his group three nights for this run. To increase the probability of getting good weather at all three sites, they can pick any three nights during an eight-night window. They could, in theory, observe more than once a year, but that would require more money, more travel and more logistical wrangling. They could also, in theory, get a longer observation window (and they have in the past), but it would require everyone to spend even longer on this mountain, waiting for the spheres to align Event Horizon Telescope could provide the first unequivocal evidence that black holes do, in fact, exist.</span>Each day around noon, Doeleman gets the weather forecasts for all three sites and makes the call for the night: Go or no go? \"It drives Shep crazy,\" Weintroub says. They're working on ways to make this decision less painful. A crucial step will be to permanently install the EHT's custom digital equipment at every station in the array, so that when the weather is good at all sites, they could trigger an observation remotely, on short notice. This is mostly a matter of securing cooperation from the committees that control the telescopes and raising the money to install the equipment. Better weather forecasts would also help. On Mauna Kea, getting accurate weather information is not a problem. Because the mountain is home to 11 observatories, many of them the most powerful instruments of their kind, Mauna Kea has its own dedicated weather station. That's not the case at smaller observatories such as SMTO and CARMA, and that makes it hard for Doeleman to know when to observe. </p>\n<p>Around midnight, the Submillimeter Array has its dishes trained on the black hole at the center of the nearby galaxy M87, which rises four hours before Sagittarius A*. Doeleman picks up a landline phone (cellphones are forbidden because they would interfere with the instruments) and calls the telescope operator in Arizona to find out when they'll be opening the dome. After a few seconds, he hangs up. \"Yes!\" he says. \"SMTO's opening the dome and should be observing in about 30 minutes.\"</p>\n<p>\"Just in time to get two scans on M87,\" says Rurik Primiani, the 25-year-old MIT graduate monitoring the Submillimeter Array's antennas. </p>\n<p>The good news has Doeleman feeling talkative. He spends a little time telling the postdocs about the technological impediments he faced 15 or 20 years ago as a grad student being introduced to the laborious art of very long baseline interferometry. The fieldwork is what attracted Doeleman to astronomy. He was never, as he puts it, the kid who played with telescopes. But he was the kind of kid who thought that spending the winter in Antarctica sounded like fun. At the age of 22, after graduating from Reed College in his hometown of Portland, Oregon, he joined a yearlong expedition to Antarctica to study cosmic rays. Afterward, he enrolled in graduate school at MIT. He chose to focus on very long baseline interferometry in part because of the high probability of spending weeks on top of cold, dry mountains in remote places.<dme:page/><br />\n<br />\nThirty minutes have passed since Doeleman last spoke to the station at Arizona, so he walks over to a phone and calls them back, just to confirm that the dome is open and the station is online. He's quiet for several moments. \"You're lying,\" he says. \"No, you're lying.\" It does not seem as if the person on the other end of the line is lying.</dme:page/></p>\n<p>\"What did I break?\" Weintroub says from across the room.</p>\n<p>Doeleman hangs up the phone and explains that for some reason, the SMTO is not yet working. Details are sketchy. But we're already on the 12th scan of the night, and the conditions in Arizona are fantastic-the tau there has now dropped to 0.05, as good as it gets in the continental U.S.-so after pacing around the control room for a few minutes, Doeleman calls back for an update. \"Now it's what?\" he asks. \"'Going crazy'? Is that a technical term?\" A muted, guilty snicker spreads among the postdocsSheperd Doeleman collapses into a folding aluminum chair. \"As you can see,\" he says, \"this is hard.\"</span>Two hours from now, Sagittarius A* rises. The stakes tonight are higher than usual: NASA's Chandra satellite is joining in, watching Sagittarius A* for x-ray flares that, when combined with the data from the EHT, could provide information about how the black hole changes by the hour. Such a finding would at least be enough for a paper in a major journal, and certainly enough to justify the money and man-hours spent conducting this observing run. So Doeleman exercises all the control he possibly can. He asks the telescope operator to call the chief faculty member at the University of Arizona in the middle of the night and ask him to get there immediately. \"Tell him, 'Shep threatened my life unless I called you.'\"</p>\n<p>Half an hour later, Doeleman receives an e-mail from Arizona and reads aloud: \"There is 'no chance whatsoever' \" that they will be back online tonight. The group now faces a decision. It's still relatively early. They could cede the remainder of tonight to other astronomers. Or they could continue with the two-station array. They weigh the options. </p>\n<p>Weintroub swivels away from his laptop and says to Doeleman, \"You've got the satellite coverage tonight from Chandra.\" Doeleman nods. Satellite coverage is not something to squander. After a moment Doeleman says, \"If Chandra detects a flare, we could do some very interesting science.\"</p>\n<p>And after all, they are here. The station in California is observing. They're running out of nights. And so the observation continues, with the first scan of Sagittarius A* scheduled for 2:05 a.m. Decision made, Doeleman collapses into a folding aluminum chair and says to me, \"As you can see, this is hard.\"<dme:page/></dme:page/></p>\n<p><br />\nEven on the clearest nights under the clearest skies on Earth, the galactic center and the dense cluster of stars around it are all but invisible to the human eye. Visible light can't make it through the clouds of dust and plasma that clog the Milky Way's glowing central globe. But radio waves can. That much became known in 1932, when a Bell Telephone Laboratories physicist named Karl Jansky noticed that whenever the galactic plane rose above the horizon, the sky exploded with radio transmissions. Since then, radio astronomers have discovered several means by which to bring the galactic center into increasingly sharp focus.</p>\n<p>The first and most important method was the same one the Event Horizon Telescope uses today-connecting multiple geographically distant radio telescopes to form an interferometer, which adds together waves collected at different telescopes to produce a new, stronger wave. In the early 1960s, almost as soon as the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in Green Bank, West Virginia, was completed, astronomers started pointing its two-station interferometer at the galactic center. Then in 1966, observing relatively low-frequency radio waves, astronomers there detected the first signs of what we now know as Sagittarius A*. The resolution was far too low to yield a definitive observation, but eight years later, Green Bank astronomers using an upgraded interferometer capable of capturing higher-frequency waves proved that something extremely dense and bright existed at the center of the galaxy. Something was sitting at the core like a gyroscope, hovering in place while the rest of the Milky Way churned around it. Eight years later, one of the astronomers named the object-which, when viewed from Earth, appears to lie in the constellation Sagittarius-Sagittarius A*.</p>\n<p>Since then, increasingly sensitive detectors and more powerful computers have enabled radio astronomers to observe at ever-higher frequencies and peer deeper into the center of the galaxy with greater clarity. Higher frequency radiation, which consists of shorter wavelengths, provides finer resolution. More important, the radiation that comes from the most extreme environment in the galactic center-the very edge of the event horizon-tends to be very high-frequency. At wavelengths longer than two millimeters, observing the galactic center is \"like looking through frosted glass in the bathroom,\" Doeleman says. At wavelengths of one millimeter and below, the frosted glass \"magically clarifies.\"</p>\n<p>To capture those one-millimeter waves, astronomers have to travel. Atmospheric water vapor blocks waves in the one-millimeter range, which is why high-frequency radio telescopes are built in places where the atmosphere is thin and arid enough to let the one-millimeter light in. High, dry places like Mauna Kea. Places like the 17,000-foot plateau in Chile's Atacama Desert (the world's driest) where the Atacama Large Millimeter Array is under construction. </p>\n<p><span style=\"border-top: 5px solid black; margin: 5px 0.5em 0.25em; float: left telescope should see a disc of darkness surrounded by a glowing halo.</span><a href= \" soon to become the world's most powerful radio-telescope array, is expected to join the Event Horizon Telescope array in 2015. Once it does, it will become the critical station in Doeleman's planet-spanning array. With ALMA on board, the EHT needs to add two, maybe three more key telescopes to approach the data-gathering capacity it will take to see Sagittarius A*'s event horizon. The EHT crew will also need to install their most advanced equipment-including the new recorders currently under development at Haystack, which should record data eight times as fast as the ones they use today-at every station. But once that's done, their virtual telescope should be able to gather enough data to make an image.</p>\n<p>Like all radio-telescope images, the picture will be an encoded map of a small patch of sky-a map of the immediate vicinity of Sagittarius A* in which the brightness of each pixel represents the intensity of radiation coming from that speck of space. It could take one excellent night to get it; it could take several very good nights of combined data. But at the end of some observing run, there will be a picture.</p>\n<p>Theorists have used supercomputers to predict what the picture should look like. If the black hole is calm, the telescope should see a disc of darkness surrounded by a glowing halo, like an eclipse. One side of the disc may contain a fat blob of light. That's a hotspot, a clumped-up cloud of accreting matter orbiting the event horizon. If Sagittarius A* is caught consuming some giant cloud of matter, the black hole may look like a ball of fire. </p>\n<p>Doeleman is quick to emphasize that the EHT will be gathering data years before and after Sagittarius A*'s shadow first comes into focus. The more telescopes Doeleman can add, the finer the detail they'll be able to resolve. Yet some theorists argue that, scientifically, the picture is almost beside the point. \"I don't think the end-all and be-all of this is producing an image,\" Broderick says. \"Eventually there will be an image, but it won't tell us much more.\" Viewed this way, the image is candy. Viewed this way, the Event Horizon Telescope is a science project designed to generate, almost by accident, a work of art.<dme:page/></dme:page/></p>\n<p><br />\nBy 2:30 a.m. local time, two-thirds of the Event Horizon Telescope is recording transmissions from Sagittarius A*, which now hangs low over the horizon. Primiani reads the data streaming in over his terminal and breaks the silence: \"Man, Sag A Star is <i>bright</i> tonight.\"</p>\n<p>The news is almost painful. Sure, if the data from tonight turns out decent <i>and</i> Chandra detects a flare, then the night could yield interesting findings, despite the failure of the telescope in Arizona. And there's always tomorrow. But for now, the crew appears to be treating the night's observation as an exercise in perseverance.</p>\n<p>Doeleman leans back in an office chair and closes his eyes. Weintroub lies down on the floor and promptly falls asleep. Everyone else continues monitoring their computers. Two and a half hours pass in which nothing happens, which is really the way these things are supposed to go. Boring is good for radio astronomy. In his 1987 book <a href= \" Light</i></a>, the writer Richard Preston describes sitting in the control room at the Palomar Mountain observatory in California with some of the greatest astronomers of the age, watching dozens of galaxies never before seen by human eyes scroll across the observation screen. It doesn't work like that here. For now, the EHT is like a half-built long-exposure camera that yields clues and promises rather than actual pictures. </p>\n<p>By 5 a.m., everyone is awake, and Rurik Primiani, still sitting behind his control monitors, is getting restless. \"Think we have enough data now?\" he asks Doeleman. \"The question is whether we're getting <i>any</i> data,\" Doeleman replies. \"Who knows what CARMA's doing. Pretty sure we know what SMTO's doing.\"</p>\n<p>Things become very still. Inspired by the witching hour, I ask Doeleman a question I had asked him before: Why black holes? \"A black hole is the only place in the universe where you can go but you can't come back,\" he says. \"In theory, if you could build the right spaceship, you could go to the center of the sun and come back. You could go to the center of a neutron star. You'd be like, 'Whoa, it's so <i>dense</i> in here!'\" he says, waving his arms in a mime's struggle to escape from a neutron-star box. \"But you could come back,\" he says. \"You could never come back from a black hole. And that's creepy. It creeps me out.\"</p>\n<p>A little after 6 a.m., as Doeleman rouses the postdocs and prepares to power down the machine, Weintroub and I decide to go watch the sun rise. \"That was frustrating as hell,\" he says, as we drive up the paved road to the true summit. All this preparation, perfect weather in Hawaii-all crippled by a broken drive motor on the telescope in Arizona. But, then, if the SMTO group can get their telescope fixed, and the weather holds at all three stations, tomorrow night could be good. \"One good night makes it all worthwhile,\" he says.</p>\n<p><center><strong>* * *</strong></center></p>\n<p>Scientists estimate that the Milky Way alone could contain millions of black holes. The ubiquity of something so violent, so absurd, so incomprehensible is enough to needle at our sense of existential unease. Black holes <i>are</i> creepy. They remind us, as philosophers have been reminding us for centuries, that we never see the world in itself. We only see its shadows.</p>\n<p>The following night, Doeleman later told me, went quite well. Technicians fixed the malfunctioning motor at SMTO. The weather held at all the sites. And our picture of the black hole at the center of the galaxy grew a little sharper.</p>\n<p>A few weeks later, looking for perspective on the Event Horizon Telescope's prospects for success, I called Fred Lo, the director emeritus of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory and a participant in the early hunt for Sagittarius A*. He said that what Doeleman and his team are trying to do is difficult but not without precedent. During the Cold War, he said, American astronomers coordinated with their Soviet counterparts on very long baseline interferometry observations. The American scientists would stop in Washington, D.C., to calibrate their atomic clocks and receive security clearance and then fly to Moscow, atomic clock in tow. Doeleman and company have plenty of problems to solve, but crossing the Iron Curtain is not one of them. \"This is the sort of thing this community has always done,\" Lo said. \"It will get done.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><b>1.

Einstein's theory of general relativity says it is there, and other observations of nearby galactic structures strongly hint at its existence as well. Einstein even told us what it should look like. But actually seeing it for the first time will tell us all kinds of things about the very nature of spacetime itself, and it will also tell us if relativity is breaking down at the core of our universe. Essentially, capturing an image of a black hole is a test of general relativity itself--a test of modern physics as we know it.</p>\n<p>\"Black holes are still theoretical constructs, they're kind of like the unicorns of the cosmological world,\" Doeleman says. \"There's very good evidence they exist, and our best test case is at the center of our galaxy where it's fairly certain there's a 4-million-solar-mass black hole lurking. But we haven't seen it yet. To ask whether Einstein is right, you have to go to the most extreme environment in the universe, which is the boundary of the black hole.\"</p>\n<p>Getting there will require a blend of new technology, old tricks, and the anointing of a brand-new radio telescope array that will come online over the next few years. But Doeleman and the various collaborators building the EHT are now confident that what wasn't even thinkable just a few years ago is now within reach, as technology has turned a time-tested astronomical technique into a tool that should give us our first glimpse of Einstein's vision of gravity's most violent manifestation.</p>\n<p>That technique is <a href=\" long baseline interferometry (VLBI)</a>, and it's what allows the EHT team to build a telescope the size of Earth without actually building anything at all. By feeding data from radio telescopes around the world into a supercomputer, they can create a telescope with an imaging area the size of the entire planet, allowing them to capture images in radio wavelengths at resolutions that should let them see straight to the heart of the Milky Way.</p>\n<p>Think of VLBI like this: You're standing at the center of the galaxy, looking at Earth, which is way out at the Milky Way's fringe. Now, imagine Earth as a mirror, but only the places where there are radio telescope arrays on its surface are polished--the rest of this planet-sized mirror is blacked out. These polished spots are the only places on the mirror that can collect data. This sparse mirror wouldn't provide a very complete picture to someone peering through the other end.</p>\n<p>But now imagine the Earth rotating. The polished portions of the lens--the parts collecting data--begin to slowly move across the blacked-out areas of the mirror, collecting data from different points on its surface as rotation and the seasonal tilt of the planet continue. Eventually, the telescopes--and there are many scattered all over the globe--have collected data from positions all over this lens, just not all at the same time. Over months and years, this data is sufficient to stitch together a rather thorough view roughly equivalent to that captured by an Earth-sized telescope mirror.</p>\n<p>That's VLBI. By linking the data from many telescopes together, the EHT can generate a virtual telescope, with a data-gathering surface the size of the planet. Their data is time-stamped by a hydrogen maser atomic clock, ensuring that given enough computing power, all the radio data can be neatly stitched together into a single picture. And given enough time, and as more radio telescopes come online, that picture grows clearer and clearer.</p>\n<p>Up to a point, at least. VLBI has been employed by astronomers for decades, but an undertaking like the EHT wasn't possible previously. The technology simply wasn't there yet. It's really not even there now, but it's so close that Doeleman and his EHT colleagues can begin gathering data.</p>\n<p>\"We have the opportunity to make measurements that weren't possible five years ago,\" Doeleman says. \"In the last five years, we've developed instrumentation to carry out VLBI at the highest frequencies where you get very good resolution. We can also now swallow large swaths of bandwidth. Instead of a couple of hundred megahertz, we can now swallow many gigahertz. You can think of that as being more energy, more photons from the black hole itself. That means our sensitivity goes way up. So it's a combination of higher sensitivity and more telescopes around the Earth that's letting us do what we couldn't five years ago. The technology is at a point now that it's a matter of implementation rather than building new systems.\"</p>\n<p>A big piece of this technological advance is the new <a href=\" Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA)</a> coming online in northern Chile over the next few years. ALMA's 66 precision antennas will be tied together into one huge radio telescope--a sort of microcosm of VLBI--that will be the most sensitive submillimeter facility on the planet.</p>\n<p>\"That, in one stroke, is going to increase the sensitivity of the Event Horizon Telescope by a factor of ten,\" Doeleman says. \"And it's going to increase our ability to see very small detail by a factor of two.\"</p>\n<p>But when observing a black hole, which allows no light to escape, what will the EHT be observing? How can it image something that seemingly cannot be imaged? Einstein has an answer for this too.</p>\n<p>\"The black hole's gravitational field is so intense that it draws all this dust and gas and matter to it,\" Doeleman says. \"But it's trying to force all that matter into such a small space that it gets very, very hot and begins to radiate--in X-rays, in the optical, and in the radio. It's a very bright source of emission across the spectrum.\"</p>\n<p>In other words, Doeleman says, we'll see the black hole because it is a messy eater--it will be ringed in radiating matter, a \"luminous soup\" that hasn't yet fallen into the black hole but is glowing at the event horizon. But exactly what this will look like is uncertain, and this will be the exciting check on relativity because relativity tells us exactly what it <i>should</i> look like. At a black hole, the gravitational force should be so intense that it lenses light around it, Einstein theorized. So while some of the light we see from that luminous soup will come to us naturally from the front side of the black hole, it will also bend light around itself, exposing us to light from the backside that, under normal circumstances, would be going the opposite direction.</p>\n<p>If relativity is correct, the image produced should show a perfectly circular ring of light--a halo of lensed light bending around the black hole--wrapped around a dim space in the middle. Einstein called this dark spot in the center the \"shadow.\" At a recent meeting of EHT partners in Tucson, all the physicists and theorists present concurred that finding that shadow--and verifying or disproving Einstein's prediction--should be a top scientific priority, Doeleman says. After all, with one image we could not only finally prove the existence of black holes, but could confirm or completely upend everything we theoretically know about what takes place at the heart of our galaxy and galaxies elsewhere in the universe.</p>\n<p>\"We're after an image that will show these strong gravity effects, we're after this shadow,\" Doeleman says. \"When we finally do take a picture, if we see this shadow, it will be an amazing, mind-altering result.\"</p>\n</div>TechnologyFeatureClay Dillowastronomyblack holesevent horizonevent horizon telescopegeneral relativitySpaceThu, 16 Feb 2012 19:25:46 +0000Clay Dillow60615 at  X-Ray Telescope Will Balloon Into the Stratosphere To Look At Black Holes \n<div class=\"center-image\"><img src=\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\"imagecache imagecache-article_image_large\" /><div><strong>Cygnus X-1</strong> <p>Artist's view of the binary system Cygnus X-1, which will be one of the targets for the X-ray polarization instrument X-Calibur, scheduled to be in the air in fall 2013 or spring 2014.</p>\n<em><p>ESO/M.

At first, astronomers thought it was a gamma-ray burst from a collapsing star, but when it kept shining in a variable pattern (brightening and fading) scientists realized it wasn't your average GRB.</p>\n<p>Astronomer Joshua Bloom at the University of California-Berkeley suspected it was a high-energy jet produced as a sun-sized star fell into a black hole and was torn to pieces. Bloom and researchers from several other institutions in the US and UK started analyzing data from the Swift Gamma Burst Mission, which first spotted the blaze of glory, as well as the Hubble Space Telescope, the Chandra X-ray Observatory and the Keck Observatory. Their analysis confirmed the theory, and was published Thursday in Science Express.</p>\n<p>As tidal forces tear the star to pieces, some of the star's mass is turned into energy. Some of that energy radiates as x-rays and gamma ray jets that spew from the swirling disk of star guts. The variable brightness is the result of new flares that occurred as more chunks of the destroyed star fell into the black hole, <a href=\" target=\"_blank\">researchers said</a>. Earth happened to be directly in the path of one of those gamma ray jets, which is why it looked so incredibly bright, scientists said.</p>\n<p>By the way, this is still going on, more than two months later.

(This star really died about 3.8 billion years ago.)</p>\n<p>The black hole in question has a mass about six or seven times that of the sun, but that's not really that big in terms of active galactic nuclei. Massive black holes, as compared to supermassive black holes, can quietly munch on gas for long periods of time, and roar to life when something wanders too close. That seems to be what happened here, Bloom said in a Cal <a href=\" target=\"_blank\">news release</a>.</p>\n<p>\"Here, you have a black hole sitting quiescently, not gobbling up matter, and all of a sudden something sets it off,\" he said. \"This could happen in our own galaxy, where a black hole sits at the center living in quiescence, and occasionally burbles or hiccups as it swallows a little bit of gas. From a distance, it would appear dormant, until a star randomly wanders too close and is shredded.\"</p>\n<p>This is a very rare event, and it's even more unlikely that Earth would get such a great view, Bloom said - probably once in 100 million years in any given galaxy.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\" target=\"_blank\">ScienceDaily</a>]</p>\n</div>ScienceRebecca Boyleastronomyblack holeblack holesgamma-ray burstsjetsnasastarsswift observatoryFri, 17 Jun 2011 20:06:42 +0000Rebecca Boyle55005 at  Supermassive Black Holes Found At Nearby Galaxy's Heart \n<div class=\"center-image\"><img src=\" 8_2.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" class=\"imagecache imagecache-article_image_large\" /><div><strong>Markarian 739</strong> <p>In visible light, Markarian 739 resembles a smiling face, with a pair of bright cores underscored by an arcing spiral arm.

Ultraviolet light traces the glow of young stars.\n\nIn the large-scale image, NGC 4150 looks very much like a typical elliptical galaxy. The dark strands of dust in the center, however, provide tentative evidence of a recent galaxy merger. The inset image shows a magnified view of the chaotic activity inside the galaxy's core. Those regions within about 650 light-years of the center that are not obscured by dust appear bright in near-ultraviolet light (shown here in blue). The blue areas indicate a flurry of recent star birth. The stellar breeding ground is about 1,300 light-years across. The stars in this area are less than a billion years old. By comparison, most of the stars in the galaxy are about 10 billion years old. These young stars most likely formed during an encounter with a smaller galaxy that was about one-twentieth the mass of NGC 4150."}
{"text": "Researchers at the Institut d'Astrophysique de Canarias (IAC), the University of La Laguna (ULL) and the Center for Physics of the Cosmos of Aragon (CEFCA) have discovered a massive star cluster near the Earth.The new cluster, called Masgomas-1, has about 20,000 solar masses, twice the mass of Trumpler 14, the star cluster known to be closer to our planet. In the Milky Way at present only about a dozen of these massive clusters (of more than 10,000 solar masses) are known, and about a hundred are estimated to exist. It is these clusters that set the pace of star formation activity and are ideal for studying the structure and the processes taking place in our galaxy.\n\nMasgomas-1 is a massive open cluster that contains more than 60 young, massive stars held together by force of gravity. It is located in the Milky Way at 11,500 light years from Earth, towards the galactic center in the Scutum-Centaurus arm ( Scutum-Centarus ) and is somewhat remote from the base that connects the arm to the bar of the galaxy.\n\nStar clusters are groups of stars that formed in the same time from the same cloud of molecular gas and dust. Open clusters, such as the recently discovered Masgomas-1, contain fewer and younger stars and are less dense than other existing clusters such as the globular with higher density and hundreds of thousands of old stars (evolved). An open star cluster that can be seen with the naked eye from Earth are the Pleiades in the constellation Taurus.\n\nUntil recently, it was assumed that our galaxy, the Milky Way was forming stars at a slower pace than other galaxies that corresponded to it in size and features. It was, in terms of star formation, thought to be \"a lazy galaxy,\" says astrophysicist Artemio Herrero IAC.\n\nThis began to change in the mid-nineties, when they discoveries began to proliferate as a result of data taken in the infrared spectrum. \"The infrared light can pass through clouds of dust obscure the plane of our galaxy, which concentrates the formation of new stars. This formation is revealed by the most massive stars, which are short-lived, and thus mark the place where stars have recently formed or are forming yet, \"explains Smith.\n\nThe discovery of Masgomas-1 has been realized thanks to observations with the infrared spectrograph LIRIS, installed on the William Herschel Telescope of the Observatorio del Roque de los Muchachos of the IAC, La Palma. This discovery is part of a systematic search for massive clusters, developed by a team of astrophysicists at the IAC and CEFCA.\n\nThe findings of the study were published in the May issue of the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics. are part of the doctoral thesis carried out at ULL Joy Sebastian Ramirez, directed by Smith, also a researcher of the IAC is a professor at the ULL, and Antonio Marin-Franch, CEFCA investigator.\n\nOur galaxy, a 'machine' to form stars\n\nInfrared data of recent years have uncovered new young star clusters and indicate that the Milky Way is actually a very efficient machine in the formation of new stars. As described by Joy Ramirez, IAC astrophysicist, \"our galaxy is vigorous and full of activity.\"\n\nWe will not know what level of star formation activity exists in the Milky Way until we have a complete idea of \u200b\u200bhow many clusters it contains. Clusters can take any size, but it is the more massive clusters that make for the star formation activity.There is an implicit consensus, but generalized to consider a very massive star cluster as if the combined mass of its stars exceeds 10,000 solar masses.\n\nDespite being very massive objects, hardly more than a dozen of these clusters are known in the Milky Way, but at least a hundred are expected to exist if we compare our results with other spiral galaxies. For this reason, Joy Ramirez says: \"The discovery of this massive cluster by our group is an important contribution to the census of massive clusters and gives a strong boost to our search method.\"\n\nThe search method uses IAC team star catalogs in the infrared (2MASS catalogs or as UKIDSS) to find clusters of stars (overdensities) in certain portions of the sky. \"Instead of making the search using all the stars in the catalog, first we filter photometry to stay with stars that could be of spectral type OB, ie massive stars, and then look for clusters. Thus, we find groups of candidates for massive stars, with the rest of the stars that surround it, are the candidate cluster, \"says the astrophysicist"}
{"text": "Sunday, December 05, 2010\n\nGlobal warming and galactic superwaves\n\nCfA astronomer Doug Finkbeiner, together with two of his students, Meng Su and Tracy Slatyer, used NASA's Fermi Gamma Ray Telescope to study the diffuse gamma ray emission. They revealed humongous bubbles of high energy emission protruding about 50,000 light-years above and below the galaxy, and centered on its nucleus. Recently, it was confirmed independently from IBEX observations, the Sun going to enter soon a million-degree galactic cloud of interstellar gas.\n\nAt the time of this prediction, astronomers believed that the cores of galaxies, including our own, become active (\"explode\") about every 10 to 100 million years and stay active for about a million years. Since our own Galactic core presently appears quiescent, they believed it would likely remain inactive for many tens of millions of years. Although in 1977, astronomer Jan Oort cited evidence that our Galactic core has been active within the past 10,000 years. In Ph.D. dissertation, Paul LaViolette hypothesized that galactic core explosions recur about every 10,000 years and last for several hundred to a few thousand years. He was the first to suggest such a short recurrence time for galactic core explosions and that our own Galactic core undergoes Seyfert-like explosions with similar frequency. In 1983 Paul LaViolette presented evidence to the scientific community indicating that galactic core explosions actually occur about every 13,000 - 26,000 years for major outbursts and more frequently for lesser events. The emitted cosmic rays escape from the core virtually unimpeded. As they travel radially outward through the Galaxy, they form a spherical shell that advances at a velocity approaching the speed of light.\n\nLaViolette's research suggests that the Sun also became highly active as dust and gas falling onto its surface induced extreme flaring activity. Together with the radiation influx from the Sun's dust cocoon, this caused the Sun's corona and photosphere to inflate, much as is observed today in dust-choked stars called \"T Tauri stars.\" These various solar effects caused atmospheric warming and inversion conditions that facilitated glacial growth which brought on ice age conditions. On occasions when the solar radiation influx to the Earth became particularly high, the ice age climate warmed, initiating episodes of rapid glacial melting and continental flooding. There is evidence that one particularly tragic solar flare event occurred around 12,900 years ago during a period when the Sun was particularly active. This involved the release of an immense coronal mass ejection which engulfed the Earth and induced a mass animal extinction. Details of this scenario are described in Paul LaViolette's book Earth Under Fire as well as in a series of journal articles he has published. Astronomical observations show the last major Galactic core explosion occurred as recently as 10,000 to 15,000 years ago.\n\nLaViolette has an analysis of this evidence of a superwave event on his blog (YT video). The geometry of the bubbles coincide with a superwave event occuring approximately 26000 years ago, which is supported by evidence in the ice core record. Data obtained from polar ice core samples show evidence of this cosmic ray event as well as other cosmic ray intensity peaks from earlier times.\n\nI'm not saying that the dynamic processes, claimed by the authors, were wrong. I'd only like to say that these phenomenon have nothing to do with the global warming because the GW has been invented by communism-ecologist people to attack the free market. Zephir, unfortunately in our world there are many enemies of freedom. The GW has nothing to do with science. It's only a political problem made by criminals but with the aid of the freedom fighters we'll achieve the victory. I don't blame you for writing such things. Your problem is due to the education received, i.e, your brain has been washed by the communism system that you have suffered. But look at Lubos, undoubtedly he's a very smart guy. Smart enough to learn that these ideas are very bad and imposed by dictators.\n\nOf course there is no global warming relation with these superwaves. However, what could be the origin of these superwaves? In my humble opinion, these waves are related to the electric polarity between the positive charged Galaxy nucleus and the negative charged GABHs (or Galaxy Anchor Black holes.) see: \n\nMonckton Myth #1: Cooling oceans (more debunking of Christopher Monckton - the same Monckton that falsely claimed to be a Nobel laureate and maintained that he has invented a cure for HIV, multiple sclerosis, influenza and other diseases)\n\n\"The storm began on Dec 13th and ended on the 22nd,\" says Karl Battams of the Naval Research Lab in Washington, DC. \"During that time, the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) detected 25 comets diving into the sun. It was crazy!\" Researchers say this could herald a much larger comet still to come.\n\nSorry Zephir for my late reaction. I must reject my 'of course not\". It should be \"of course yes\" Planets are puffed up by the Mini Black hole nuclei of former Comets which crashed into these planets and even moons.\n\nWhile the influence of human to global warming in undeniable (compare the rainy weekends phenomena, for example), I don't think the recent development of global warming is of atropocentric origin. IMO solar system is facing dense cloud of dark matter (consisting of mostly antinetrinos), which are shifting center of mass of solar system, thus breaking solar cycles driven with Jupiter planet. Evidence of global warming accross solar system: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. The antineutrinos are supposedly slowing nuclear fusion, but they're accelerating the decay of heavy elements (the electron capture of K-40 in particular) which are the sources of geothermal heat as the Earth and another planets of solar system. The geothermal flux from the Earth core to the bottom of the ocean can be quite negiglible (~ 0,5 W/m\u00b2 with compare to 1600 W/m\u00b2 of solar constant). Most of heat is generated with decay of K-40 directly at the water. The total activity of ocean water exceeds 3.8 x 10E+11 Ci (14000 EBq) - for comparison 100 million Ci has been released in ninety atmospheric tests at the Nevada Test Site. The hypothesis is supported with heat content anomaly and with recent finding of the hidden circumantartic current, As the another indicia of this hypothesis can increased geovolcanic activity (observable for example at Vesuvius and Yellowstone calderas), increased frequency and intensity of earthquakes, the increased frequency of comet impacts observed at Jupiter and Sun, the swelling of kilogram and meter prototypes in dense vacuum, the shift of speed of light and/or gravity constant toward lower values, etc. (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23)\n\nStuart Freedman: \"One thing we can say with near certainty is that radioactive decay alone is not enough to account for Earth's heat energy. Whether the rest is primordial heat or comes from some other source is an unanswered question\". Ms. Riofrio thinks a black hole has breached our planet's core and may be about to release literal hell on Earth.\n\nWhat a great piece to write on! Such wild new information we're compiling now in regards to the astro-geophysical model of climate variation. I have written bits and pieces about the same topic(s) within many of my blog articles, but I usually subsume them into anthropological research and theories. Even the origin of musical frequency timing is perhaps strikingly relative to the 26,000 (25,920 really) year-long precession of equinoxes, a timeframe somewhat referred to in this piece of yours. Anywho - glad to link up! Keep 'em coming.\n\nOne paper claims the heat is real, but it's deep in the oceans. Spencer's work, published (pdf) in the journal Remote Sensing, concludes that more energy is radiated back to space than previously thought, and it is released earlier, too.\n\nBoth uranium-238 and thorium-232 together contribute 20 TW to Earth's heat flux. The neutrinos emitted from the decay of potassium-40 are below the limits of detection in Borexino and [url= experiments[/url], but are known to contribute 4 TW. IMO radioactive decay of the potassium-40 (which is concentrated in the oceans) accelerated with neutrinos from dark matter is the main factor contributing to the global warming and [url= content anomaly[/url] (and increased geovolcanic activity, shift of magnetic poles and many other effects).\n\n[url= could be heating the Earth's core[/url] too. Geophysicists have found much less potassium in the Earth's crust and mantle than would be expected based on the composition of rocky meteors that supposedly formed the Earth. They've shown that at the high pressures and temperatures in the Earth's interior, potassium can form an alloy with iron never before observed. During the planet's formation, this potassium-iron alloy could have sunk to the core, depleting potassium in the overlying mantle and crust and providing a radioactive potassium heat source in addition to that supplied by uranium and thorium in the core."}
{"text": "Astronomers Watch as Stars Are Born\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"We are stardust, billion-year-old carbon,\" sang Joni Mitchell. Many artists have been inspired by the idea that since we are made of elements heavier than lithium, we are composed of atoms forged in stars, and any element heavier than iron must have been formed in a supernova. Supernovae are the death throes of stars and release tremendous amounts of energy, enough energy to bind lighter elements together, creating all the heavy elements like gold, platinum and uranium. Since Earth contains plenty of these elements, it has been assumed that the sun is not a first generation star and the solar system must have formed later in order to accumulate all the heavy elements we see on the earth.\n\nSupernovae may even play a more important role that previously thought. Besides providing precious metals, a supernova may have played an integral part in the creation of our sun.\n\nProf. Lee Hartman, astronomy, University of Michigan, spoke yesterday at the astronomy colloquium about a new, more fast-paced solar creation process. Supported by observational evidence from star forming regions across the galaxy and theoretical models back here on Earth, Hartman presented a plan of solar formation that explains some of the sore points in previous models.\n\nAlmost all models begin with a large cloud of hydrogen gas, which astronomers see throughout the galaxy. Gravity from the center of the cloud would pull on the edges and drag the cloud inward. Already there is a problem; if the cloud is allowed to shrink itself completely, it would form far too massive a star at the center. The star would be larger than anything seen in the galaxy today. One hypothesis says that magnetic fields create turbulence that \"fluff\" the gas, preventing all of it from falling inward.\n\nHartman disagreed with this hypothesis. The previous theory suggests that star formation occurs slowly and at speeds dictated by the magnetic turbulence rather than by the freefall associated with gravity. However, Hartman suggests that gravity was in charge and inside a large gas cloud the densest regions quickly begin falling inward immediately. Soon these regions are massive enough to be considered stars and begin fusing hydrogen at their cores.\n\nThe biggest stars are the first to go, dying because of their own giganticness. As they implode at the center, huge amounts of energy are given off as a supernova. This supernova pushes all the gas in the surrounding region outward in a giant bubble or column. These are often the most striking pictures seen by the Hubble and other telescopes. It is on the edge of these bubbles where gas again becomes dense enough to form stars, except now that the cloud has been spread out over a surface, it no longer will collapse into a single point but into many stars, one of which, we may call home."}

This list is in no particular order, isn't anywhere close to complete, and has some overlap with Ed's list. My main criteria are that these are writers I read regularly, so their interests mix with mine to some degree.

Many media outlets described his jump as beginning \"at the edge of space\", but the story is a little more complex than that.\n\nOne thing bothered me, though, about a lot of the coverage: many people said Baumgartner was jumping \"from space\" or \"from the edge of space\". Don't get me wrong\u201439 km is a long way up, about 4 times the altitude of commercial airliners, so I'm not denigrating this accomplishment at all. Atmospheric pressure is about 2% of its value at Earth's surface at 39 km, and the temperatures are pretty cold, so Baumgartner had to wear a pressurized suit and carry an air supply. (If memory serves, the temperature was -7\u00b0 C or 19\u00b0 F when the dive began.) However, it's not what is conventionally considered \"space\": it's within the region of Earth's atmosphere known as the stratosphere (which also explains the project's official name, \"Stratos Jump\"). So, if Baumgartner didn't jump from space, where is the boundary of space?

The published papers cited in the Nobel literature belie that: many coauthors contribute to the majority of research now, and a single seminal (there's that masculine imagery again) paper generally isn't what establishes a research program as worthy of accolades. As a result, every Nobel Prize discussion seems to involve complaints about why some scientists were included, and some ignored. [Read more....]"}

{"text": "Milky Way galaxy may have hidden twin\n\nA large galaxy could be lurking unseen in our own cosmic backyard, a pair of researchers says. Such a massive object could explain a mysterious gravitational pull on the Milky Way.\n\nAstronomers know both the direction and speed of the Milky Way's motion based on measurements of the cosmic microwave background - radiation that filled all space shortly after the big bang. The wavelength of this radiation appears slightly shorter in the direction of the Milky Way's motion because of the Doppler effect.\n\nThis motion is thought to be due to the gravitational pull from surrounding galaxies and clusters of galaxies. But when the influence of all known galaxies and galaxy clusters is added up, the Milky Way's actual motion is off by about 20\u00b0.\n\nNow, new calculations suggest that the discrepancy may be due to a large galaxy hidden right on our cosmic doorstep, or a hidden cluster of galaxies somewhat farther away in the same direction. The calculations were made by Avi Loeb and Ramesh Narayan of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Massachusetts, US.\n\nMassive neighbour\n\nThey used data from the 2 Micron Redshift Survey (2MRS) to calculate how the Milky Way should be moving if it were affected only by the galaxies observed in that survey. Then they compared that to how our galaxy actually is moving based on measurements of the cosmic microwave background.\n\nThey found that our galaxy has an extra motion of 120 kilometres per second in roughly the direction of our galaxy's centre as seen from Earth.\n\nThey found that a galaxy slightly more massive than our own could account for the motion if it were located about 3 million light years away behind our galaxy's centre. This would make it our most massive neighbour, aside from the Andromeda galaxy, which has a similar mass and is about 2.5 million light years from Earth.\n\nDust veil\n\nSuch a large, nearby galaxy could have remained hidden until now because of the thick dust that obscures the sky in the direction of the galactic centre, the researchers say.\n\nAnother possibility is that the extra pull is due to a large cluster of thousands of galaxies lying about 70 million light years from Earth in the same direction and obscured for the same reason. Alternatively, a combination of individual galaxies and galaxy clusters in this direction could be responsible, Loeb says.\n\n\"We are ignorant about our immediate neighbourhood behind the Milky Way,\" he told New Scientist. \"If we wait 100 million years, the Sun will go to the other side of the galaxy and then we can see what's on the other side. But that's a long time to wait - we want to know before that.\" Radio surveys could penetrate the dust and reveal galaxies behind the galaxy's centre, he says.\n\nPirin Erdogdu of Nottingham University in the UK, who led a similar study published in 2006, says X-ray surveys would already have spotted a cluster of galaxies like the one Loeb and Narayan suggest, ruling out that option.\n\nDistant pull\n\nBut she says it would be possible for a large individual galaxy to hide behind the dust. \"There could be a nearby spiral or even a mid-sized elliptical galaxy, which are generally much bigger, within say 10\u00b0 of the galactic centre [that] we do not know about,\" she told New Scientist.\n\nBut she says it is very difficult to make a firm conclusion about any hidden galaxies from Loeb and Narayan's study, which only considered objects within 400 million light years of our galaxy. Mass concentrations beyond this distance are likely to have a significant influence on our galaxy's motion as well, she says.\n\nBrent Tully of the University of Hawaii in Honolulu, US, agrees. He thinks the extra motion Loeb and Narayan describe may be due to a supercluster of galaxies containing more than 10,000 times as much mass as the Milky Way called the Shapley concentration.\n\nIt lies about 700 million light years from Earth in a part of the sky about 40\u00b0 from our galaxy's centre. \"We are unlikely to be missing an important local attractor's Propagation Speed\n\nIs the effect of gravity instantaneous or do the gravity wawes (not observed yet) propagate at the speed of light?\n\nIn case i someday had trouble of getting sleep i'd have then something to think about: Where are and where were the galaxies that affect our velocity now? The galaxies have moved since the light escaped them. How about gravity? If the space is not completely void then the speed of light should differ from that of the gravity. Speed difference would mean difference in observed direction...\n\nGravity's Propagation Speed\n\nGravity's Propagation Speed\n\nFri Nov 30 17:25:05 GMT 2007 by Anonymous\n\nIndeed, relativity implies a gravitational change travels at c. So if our sun suddenly vanished we wouldn't know until about 8 minutes later when the last of the light would reach us. At that point the Earth's trajectory would continue likely on a tangent to its previous orbit around the sun. At least until a large gravatational field influenced it.\n\nGravity's Propagation Speed\n\nMon Dec 03 01:32:02 GMT 2007 by Luke Andrew Marsh\n\nAt a guess The gravitation works down to an infinite speed but the speed at which its coalleses in 3 dimensions would be relative to the speeds at which a double proton spin can turn to a single spin and not the speed at which such a spin can move along it's own warp axies on a 3 dimensional plane(i'e the speed of light). Hence would be slower from such perspective.\n\nThis research is of great interest to me.\n\nPerhaps the spin of this galaxy is relative to the speed at which gravity coalleses in 4 dimensions and perhaps the galaxy there looking for is a less matured proto galaxy the other side of this galaxies warp axie and perhaps the effect even exteneds to a build up of on the 4d Z\" line then when fully energised will rip all the remaining enegy in this galaxy away and yet spawn another Quazar build.\n\nHence one might be looking for to Gravitational effects subversive of one another in calculating such a thing accuratly.\n\nIf true then our galaxy took a lot longer to form in its initial stage before fully Quazaring and should rip apart a lot sooner than expected.\n\nThat certianly is more in line with how protons progress as they move around on the Z line.\n\nPlease excuse my wild imagination.\n\nAlso i might add that blue shift research might help assertain the answer to this question of why anything spin at all which is the real issue here isn't it and it's somthing we all should have a go at because its a question we need to solve and progress with.\n\nOh and if you don't like what i've got to say \"spin on it\"\n\nNo i don't believe in the big bang, God, Quantumality,difinitve constants which in my oppinion are of a fiticious universe. I think it's all just interdeminsional energy in a state trasgression that works down to coallessent energy signitures infinitly impossible to ever see in their most simplist form. I think many an ET has had fun trying weave out such problems for years that go on longer than we can even currently express.\n\nSo year just keep spinning up thoughts and foolishly hoping we'll work everything out one day and by the time you know it you'll be dead or have lived so long you'll want to be somthing diffrent for a change.\n\nThis research is rather a good one though because it should help us to get a better grip on how things work if we're clever enough understand what our galaxy has to show us.\n\nGravity's Propagation Speed\n\nCosmology\n\nSat Dec 01 01:04:56 GMT 2007 by Micromike\n\nThis is all nonsense. The cosmos is infinite and big bangs come from black holes that have grown too large to hold their energy. The speed of light is C^2, much faster than light as evidenced by intangled particles communicating faster than light speed. The motion of our galaxy was probably imparted when our galaxy was orbiting a large black hole that blew up and our galaxy was propelled through space at its current speed. It is not being attracted to anything..

It centers on the simple principle of triangulation. Just as the motion of the Milky Way relative to the CBR can be calculated, so too can the motions of our nearest galactic neighbors, like Andromeda, be likewise calculated. Since we know the masses of those galaxies as well as our own, and their speeds, if there are similar deviations in those galaxies in different directions than the milky way, we simply calculate the position of the unseen mass in three dimensions by triangulating back to a central mass that is affecting all galaxies local to our region. Therefore the position and mass of the unseen galaxy is easily calculated by this type of triangulation. Q.e.d.\n\nA galaxy as massive as the Andromeda galaxy, seen here in ultraviolet and infrared light, could be lurking behind a veil of dust at the centre of the Milky Way. If it is there and we could see through the dust, the galaxy would appear larger than the Full Moon (Image: NASA/JPL-Caltech)"}

(c) ESO\n\nThe star R Coronae Australis lies in one of the nearest and most spectacular star-forming regions. This portrait was taken by the Wide Field Imager (WFI) on the MPG/ESO 2.2-metre telescope at the La Silla Observatory in Chile. The image is a combination of twelve separate pictures taken through red, green and blue filters.\n\nThis image shows a section of sky that spans roughly the width of the full Moon. This is equivalent to about four light-years at the distance of the nebula, which is located some 420 light-years away in the small constellation of Corona Australis (the Southern Crown). The complex is named after the star R Coronae Australis, which lies at the centre of the image. It is one of several stars in this region that belong to the class of very young stars that vary in brightness and are still surrounded by the clouds of gas and dust from which they formed.\n\nThe intense radiation given off by these hot young stars interacts with the gas surrounding them and is either reflected or re-emitted at a different wavelength. These complex processes, determined by the physics of the interstellar medium and the properties of the stars, are responsible for the magnificent colours of nebulae. The light blue nebulosity seen in this picture is mostly due to the reflection of starlight off small dust particles. The young stars in the R Coronae Australis complex are similar in mass to the Sun and do not emit enough ultraviolet light to ionise a substantial fraction of the surrounding hydrogen. This means that the cloud does not glow with the characteristic red colour seen in many star-forming regions.\n\nThe huge dust cloud in which the reflection nebula is embedded is here shown in impressively fine detail. The subtle colours and varied textures of the dust clouds make this image resemble an impressionist painting. A prominent dark lane crosses the image from the centre to the bottom left. Here the visible light emitted by the stars that are forming inside the cloud is completely absorbed by the dust. These objects could only be detected by observing at longer wavelengths, by using a camera that can detect infrared radiation.\n\nR Coronae Australis itself is not visible to the unaided eye, but the tiny, tiara-shaped constellation in which it lies is easily spotted from dark sites due to its proximity on the sky to the larger constellation of Sagittarius and the rich star clouds towards the centre of our own galaxy, the Milky Way"}

About 3.75 billion years from now, Andromeda's disk fills the field of view and its gravity begins to create tidal distortions in the Milky Way. The view is inspired by dynamical computer modeling of the future collision between the two galaxies. The two galaxies collide about 4 billion years from now and merge to form a single galaxy about 6 billion years from now. Credit: NASA/ESA/Z. Levay and R. van der Marel (STScI)/A. Mellinger\n\nNASA astronomers announced Thursday, May 31, that they can now predict with certainty the next major cosmic event to affect our galaxy, the Sun, and the solar system: the titanic collision of our Milky Way Galaxy with the neighboring Andromeda Galaxy (M31).\n\nThe Milky Way is destined to get a major makeover during the encounter, which is predicted to happen 4 billion years from now. It is likely that the Sun will be flung into a new region of our galaxy, but Earth and the solar system are in no danger of being destroyed.\n\n\"Our findings are statistically consistent with a head-on collision between the Andromeda Galaxy and our Milky Way Galaxy,\" said Roeland van der Marel from the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) in Baltimore, Maryland. The solution came through painstaking NASA Hubble Space Telescope measurements of the motion of Andromeda from STScI.\n\nThe scenario is like a baseball batter watching an oncoming fastball. Although Andromeda is approaching us more than 2 thousand times faster, it will take 4 billion years before the strike.\n\nComputer simulations derived from Hubble's data show that it will take an additional 2 billion years after the encounter for the interacting galaxies to completely merge under the tug of gravity and reshape into a single elliptical galaxy similar to the kind commonly seen in the local universe. Although the galaxies will plow into each other, stars inside each galaxy are so far apart that they will not collide with other stars during the encounter; however Galaxy (M33),, mph (400,000 km/h). That is fast enough to travel from here to the Moon from STScI.\n\n\"In the 'worst-case-scenario'And, Ray, you must understand that, compared to their relative SIZES, galaxies are huge and close together. The Andromeda Galaxy is 2.538 MLY away, only 25 Milky Way diameters, or so. If the Sun were a golf ball, 42.67 mm in diameter, then the nearest star would be 31,146,7070 solar diameters away.

This FACT is often overlooked in long-distance positional calculations, due to the COMPOUNDING effects of this level of time passage. Imagine, during that 4 BILLION years, a motion of 100 million light-years (LY) occurred. OK. Another 100 MILLION years passes, and the object travels 620,000 LY. OK. Another 620,000 YEARS pass, and we're at the object. A significant flux from unity, BTW.\n\nAlso, EVERYONE, please discount every single thing Bill Simpson fro Louisiana says. EVERYTHING! Sometimes, I believe his by-line is a plant, meant to distract us from deeper thoughts, pondering his ignorance.

Waste none!\n\nSubmitted: 7/29/2012 1:59:08 AM (CST)\n\nRAY GREWEfrom CALIFORNIA\nsaid:\n\nBill, I agree with your cynicism. Even with computer simulations that would show the apparent safety of Earth when the collision happens, I don't think there is any real guarantee that anyone, or any simulation could make that Earth won't somehow be affected. But let's face it - no one born a hundred million years from tomorrow will be concerned with it. I think it's nice that they made the discovery, but why do they bother telling us about something that will not occur for four billion years? And will human kind (in any form) still be here? To what you said about fossil fuels running out, along with population and sustainability issues, I have doubts we will see the 22nd century. That's just MY cynicism talking.\n\nAlso, I have a problem with the idea that there will be absolutely no cases of stellar collisions. I understand that the distances between individual stars is immense, but to say that there will not be any instances at all of two stellar bodies running into each other seems a bit of a stretch. Maybe collisions among stars will be the exception rather than the rule, but I think that some stars are bound to collide. When the members of either galaxy begin to mingle (and it's even stated in the article that the stars will get jostled and moved into other random orbits), wouldn't gravitation cause some bodies to get too close to one another, leading to a possible collision?\n\nSubmitted: 6/5/2012 1:00:32 AM (CST)\n\nBRIAN UGARTEfrom NEVADA\nsaid:\n\nThe only thing I can really write is that the sky at that point of time would be very interesting. What wonders await when both galaxies interact? At such close quarters, stars belonging to another galaxy should look almost as if the belonged to our own. Oh well, I suppose speculation is all we little humans can really do.\n\nSubmitted: 6/4/2012 10:53:21 AM (CST)\n\nBILL SIMPSONfrom LOUISIANA\nsaid:\n\nI liked the 'how safe the Earth will be', part of the article. Lets assume our descendants manage to survive millions of years into the future, which is probably the exception with any animal species. ( I'll ignore the very real possibility of the collapse of industrial civilization once the fossil fuels that power it run out during the next century, and assume that wind and solar will power everything.) In about 100 million years, the Sun will start to run low on hydrogen and begin to work on heavier elements. That will greatly increase its' energy output. It will also begin to get a LOT bigger. The oceans on Earth will be boiled away and the surface heated to hundreds of degrees. Should the surface of the expanding Sun get close enough to the Earth, it might boil it into vapor. Human ancestors, who won't look like us, would have had to flee this planet long before Andromeda gets anywhere near here. I like these articles about millions of years in the future. Do these folks realize the bad things that could happen in a million years, much less a billion. Yellowstone blows up next week and humans might be extinct in a year. A big comet comes out from behind the Sun and nails Earth, and you won't see 2014. Sorry to be so cynical, but I had a bad experience at the vehicle inspection certificate place. Little did they know that I had just erased the error code on the dashboard with my scanner, so they put a sticker on a defective vehicle. I beat the system again, so it was worth the rude treatment. And of course, they were wrong. They are going to 2 year inspection intervals.

{"text": "With a recent NSF award, UA scientists will use galaxy clusters as astronomical lenses to peer farther into the depths of space than any manmade telescope is capable of viewing - to the time when the universe's earliest stars and galaxies still were forming from the gravitational collapse of gas and dark matter.\n\nThe University of Arizona is renowned for making some of the world's largest and most precise optics for some of the world's greatest telescopes. Now, UA scientists are making use of lenses that defy human ability to build: They are made up of clusters of galaxies and dark matter. With a $600,000 grant from the National Science Foundation, UA professor of astronomy Ann Zabludoff and her team at Steward Observatory, including graduate students Ken Wong and Decker French, along with Mark Ammons at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and co-principal investigator Charles Keeton at Rutgers University, are working to find and analyze these cosmic lenses. By magnifying objects even farther way in space, these natural cosmic lenses may enable astronomers to see farther back in time than possible with any manmade telescope, to the time of the formation of the universe's very first stars and galaxies. \"We're talking about stuff back to literally the dawn of time,\" Zabludoff said. \"Twelve billion years ago closing in on 13 billion years ago.\" For years, astronomers have been trying to detect the very first stars and galaxies that formed after the Big Bang, Zabludoff said, to see how the stars and galaxies built up a mass of subatomic particles called baryons over time. \"Baryons are the stuff of which we and the things in our experience are made,\" said Zabludoff. Protons and neutrons, which make up the nuclei of atoms, are baryons. Effectively, all visible matter is made up of baryons and electrons. \"What we do know about the gas distribution in the early universe is that it looks like this wonderful web, almost a spider web of gas,\" Zabludoff said. \"It's natural to imagine that the galaxies form in the interstitial regions of these filaments and the baryons, including the gas, that we see fall into the galaxy.\""}

On paper, Planck sounds very similar to the WMAP satellite launched 8 years earlier, or the COBE Satellite launched in 1989: measure and map the perturbations in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation.\n\nThe CMB radiation is a very nearly uniform remnant from the early universe, roughly 380,000 years after the big bang when the universe was approximately 1000 times smaller, and thus 1000 times hotter than it is now. These days, the CMB is only 2.73K and barely noticeable, unless you get very lucky, or happen to be looking for it.\n\nThe CMB is also very nearly uniform in every direction, with the temperature only varying by about 1 part in 100,000 from place to place. Those differences, however, mean a lot. The blue spots in the map above correspond to directions slightly cooler than average, while the red spots are slightly hotter. Those hot and cool patches ultimately give rise to the mass perturbations in the universe that we see today, including all of the large scale structure (galaxies, clusters of galaxies, etc.) that we see around us.\n\nThe Results\n\nThe Planck satellite has a number of advantages over its predecessors. For one thing, it has 9 different frequency channels, giving it increased sensitivity, and allowing the Planck team to effectively remove various types of foreground sources. Planck also measures structure to a much smaller scale. To give you an idea, you can take all of the hot and cold spots and make a spectrum of how much structure there is on various scales:\n\nIf you've never seen one of these plots before, large scale (corresponding to the whole sky) is to the left while small scale (corresponding to something like 4 minutes of arc) is to the right. The red curve is a purely theoretical model, while the blue dots (with error bars) show the average of the data. This is astounding precision science!\n\nEarlier this morning, ESA made a public announcement about the data and results from 15 months of observations. Essentially, they adjusted the various cosmological parameters until the red curve above matched the blue dots as closely as possible. In addition, they adjusted to include information from the WMAP satellite and other cosmological measurements. The thirty (!) technical papers will be officially released on the arxiv tomorrow, but there were a few big surprises.\n\nNotably, they found a little more dark matter and a little less dark energy than previously supposed.\n\nCredit: Planck and ESA\n\nIn addition, they found a somewhat lower Hubble Constant than previously supposed. Instead of the best-fit concluded from WMAP, Planck found a slightly slower expansion, only . The age of the universe, when all of these numbers are plugged in, is still about 13.8 Billion Years.\n\nIf you are an expert and want the money table, here it is (click to zoom in):\n\nShould you freak out about these differences?\n\nNo.\n\nWhile it's always interesting when the best-fit cosmological parameters get tweaked, it's important to remember that these are estimates. There are error bars involved, and in this case, the differences between these results and the WMAP 9 year results are something on the order of 2 or so. Interesting, and likely to bounce around a bit, bit nothing earth-shattering.\n\nIn their overview paper, the Planck team did announce a few things that I thought were kind of noteworthy (with a little editorializing on my part):\n\n\"An exploration of parameter space beyond the basic set leads to: (a) firmly establishing the effective number of relativistic\nspecies (neutrinos) at 3;\"\n\nWe expected this, but if there is another species of neutrino, it's fairly massive.\n\n\"(b) constraining the flatness of space-time to a level of 0.1%;\"\n\nGreat constraint! And unsurprising given the standard model of inflation.\n\n\"we find no evidence at the current level of analysis for tensor modes, nor for a dynamical form of dark energy, nor for time variations of the fine structure constant\"\n\nThat is inflation seems to be fairly generic, dark energy seems even more likely to be a cosmological constant, and despite some claims to the contrary, physical parameters seem to be fixed.\n\n\"we do find evidence for deviations from isotropy at low l's.In particular, we find a coherent deficit of power with respect to our best-fit CDM model at l's between 20 and 30.\"\n\nThis is quite interesting. The large scale structure \u2014 small l \u2014 doesn't quite fit. This sort of problem showed up in WMAP as well. In announcements, they're not making a huge deal about this, however, and personally, I don't think it presents much of a problem to the newly tweaked standard cosmological model.\n\n\"the first detection at high significance () of the cross-correlation between CMB lensing and the cosmic infrared background, which allows us to constrain the star formation rate at high redshifts.\"\n\nThis, and some of their other results, are putting very tight constraints on the epochs of the first stars.\n\nThis is a very big deal. The Integrated Sachs-Wolfe Effect basically measures the difference between the blue shifting of microwave background photons as they fall into forming clusters and the redshifting as they climb out. They measure, in effect, the overall increase in structure over a finite amount of time. Since the growth of structure is directly predicted by cosmology it is a very robust way of putting an additional constraint on the models.\n\nExpect lots of news and discussion over the next few days. While the Planck results don't overturn the picture of our universe, they are some pretty exciting and astoundingly precise results!"}

{"text": "Breaking science news from around the world\n\nTop Story: October 24, 2012\n\nFast Stars\n\nAs Einstein might say, speed is relative. It certainly captures our imagination. For example, you may think you're sitting still, but by some reckoning, you are moving incredibly fast\u2014as Earth spins and orbits within the Solar System and as the Sun makes its way around the Milky Way. In fact, for us to make a full rotation around the galactic center every 250 million years, we have to be moving at the brisk pace of half a million miles an hour!\n\nBut as fast as we are moving, it's a leisurely stroll compared to some stars that have made recent headlines. These so called \"hypervelocity stars\" are allowing scientists a first hand view of the incredible and mysterious super-massive black hole at the center of our Milky Way galaxy. Since we cannot observe the black hole directly, we study the motion of nearby matter\u2014stars, gas, and dust\u2014to learn much about the black hole's mass and how it distorts space around it. These observations grant astrophysicists an opportunity to test the inner workings of Einstein's theory of relativity on a grand scale.\n\nAnother group of super-fast superstars out there seems to be related. They are not gravitationally bound to the black hole, or anything else in the galaxy. In fact, they have been flung out from the Milky Way at speeds so great that they will actually escape it entirely! Some scientists have speculated that these \"runaway\" or \"rogue\" stars may have once been the companions of the very same hypervelocity stars that orbit within the Milky Way, but these rogue stars were flung off long ago when their partners were pulled into the supermassive black hole's gravitational influence.\n\nAnother possible origin for the stellar speedsters could be a companion or nearby star that went supernova and blasted them out into the great beyond. Astronomers search for these stars before they exit the galaxy by looking for the tell-tale bow shock they create as they pass through the thin gas of the Milky Way, much like the wake a speedboat creates on a calm lake.\n\nNo matter their origins, hypervelocity stars and any other super speedy things provide critical windows into relativity and the nature of space and time. Special relativity predicts the ways in which physics will change as something approaches the speed of light; general relativity describes the behavior of objects in intense gravitational fields (like you might find near a black hole, hmm\u2026). These stars and others like them give us a great chance to challenge our ideas about the nature and workings of our universe and get a view \"beneath the hood\" to understand how it has changed and evolved over time.\n\nJosh Roberts is a program presenter and astronomer at the California Academy of Sciences.

{"text": "The Helix nebula: Bigger in death than life\n\nOct 04, 2012 by Whitney Clavin\n\nA dying star is throwing a cosmic tantrum in this combined image Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech\n\n(Phys.org)\u2014A dying star is refusing to go quietly into the night, as seen in this combined infrared and ultraviolet view\n\nThis object, called the Helix nebula, lies 650 light-years away in the constellation of Aquarius. Also known by the catalog number NGC 7293, it is a typical example of a class of objects called planetary nebulae. Discovered in the 18th century, these cosmic works of art were erroneously named for their resemblance to gas-giant planets.\n\nPlanetary nebulae are actually the remains of stars that once looked a lot like our sun. These stars spend most of their lives turning hydrogen into helium in massive runaway nuclear fusion reactions in their cores. In fact, this process of fusion provides all the light and heat that we get from our sun. Our sun will blossom into a planetary nebula when it dies in about five billion years.\n\nWhen the hydrogen fuel for the fusion reaction runs out, the star turns to helium for a fuel source, burning it into an even heavier mix of carbon, nitrogen and oxygen. Eventually, the helium will also be exhausted, and the star dies, puffing off its outer gaseous layers and leaving behind the tiny, hot, dense core, called a white dwarf. The white dwarf is about the size of Earth, but has a mass very close to that of the original star; in fact, a teaspoon of a white dwarf would weigh as much as a few elephants!\n\nThe intense ultraviolet radiation from the white dwarf heats up the expelled layers of gas, which shine brightly in the infrared. GALEX has picked out the ultraviolet light pouring out of this system, shown throughout the nebula in blue, while Spitzer has snagged the detailed infrared signature of the dust and gas in red, yellow and green. Where red Spitzer and blue GALEX data combine in the middle, the nebula appears pink. A portion of the extended field beyond the nebula, which was not observed by Spitzer, is from NASA's all-sky Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE). The white dwarf star itself is a tiny white pinprick right at the center of the nebula.\n\nRelated Stories\n\n(PhysOrg.com) -- If this were an inkblot test, you might see a bow tie or a butterfly depending on your personality.

But small galaxies form stars too, like nearby NGC 6822, also known as Barnard's Galaxy. Beyond the rich starfields in the constellation Sagittarius, NGC 6822 is a mere 1.5 million light-years away, a member of our Local Group of galaxies. About 7,000 light-years across, the dwarf irregular galaxy is seen to be filled with young blue stars and mottled with the telltale pinkish hydrogen glow of star forming regions in the deep color composite image. Contributing to the science of LITTLE THINGS, this portrait of a small galaxy was made as part of the Lowell Amateur Research Initiative (LARI), welcoming collaborations with amateur astronomers.\n\nThis moon is shining by the light of its planet. Specifically, a large portion of Enceladus pictured above is illuminated primarily by sunlight first reflected from the planet Saturn. The result is that the normally snow-white moon appears in the gold color of Saturn's cloud tops. As most of the illumination comes from the image left, a labyrinth of ridges throws notable shadows just to the right of the image center, while the kilometer-deep canyon Labtayt Sulci is visible just below. The bright thin crescent on the far right is the only part of Enceladus directly lit by the Sun. The above image was taken last year by the robotic Cassini spacecraft during a close pass by by the enigmatic moon. Inspection of the lower part of this digitally sharpened image reveals plumes of ice crystals thought to originate in a below-surface seaFrom afar, the whole thing looks like an Eagle. A closer look at the Eagle Nebula, however, shows the bright region is actually a window into the center of a larger dark shell of dust. Through this window, a brightly-lit workshop appears where a whole open cluster of stars is being formed. In this cavity tall pillars and round globules of dark dust and cold molecular gas remain where stars are still forming. Already visible are several young bright blue stars whose light and winds are burning away and pushing back the remaining filaments and walls of gas and dust. The Eagle emission nebula, tagged M16, lies about 6500 light years away, spans about 20 light-years, and is visible with binoculars toward the constellation of the Serpent (Serpens). This picture combines three specific emitted colors and was taken with the 0.9-meter telescope on Kitt Peak, Arizona, USA.\n\nDark, smooth regions that cover the Moon's familiar face are called by Latin names for oceans and seas. The naming convention is historical, though it may seem a little ironic to denizens of the space age who recognize the Moon as a mostly dry and airless world, and the smooth, dark areas as lava-flooded impact basins. For example, this elegant lunar vista, a careful mosaic of telescopic images, looks across the expanse of the northwestern Mare Imbrium, or Sea of Rains, into the Sinus Iridum - the Bay of Rainbows. Ringed by the Jura Mountains (montes), the bay is about 250 kilometers across, bounded at the bottom of the rugged arc by Cape (promontorium) Laplace. The cape's sunlit face towers nearly 3,000 meters above the bay's surface. At the top of the arc is Cape Heraclides, at times seen as a moon maiden.\n\nThis stunning group of galaxies is far, far away - about 450 million light-years from planet Earth - cataloged as galaxy cluster Abell S0740. Dominated by the cluster's large central elliptical galaxy (ESO 325-G004), this sharp Hubble view takes in a remarkable assortment of galaxy shapes and sizes with only a few spiky foreground stars scattered through the field. The giant elliptical galaxy spans over 100,000 light years and contains about 100 billion stars, comparable in size to our own spiral Milky Way. The Hubble data reveal a wealth of detail in even these distant galaxies, including magnificent arms and dust lanes, star clusters, ring structures, and gravitational lensing arcs.\n\nSome moons wouldn't survive the collision. Tethys, one of Saturn's larger moons at about 1000 kilometers in diameter, survived the collision, but sports today the expansive impact crater Odysseus. Sometimes called the Great Basin, Odysseus occurs on the leading hemisphere of Tethys and shows its great age by the relative amount of smaller craters that occur inside its towering walls. The density of Tethys is similar to water-ice. The above digitally enhanced image was captured late last year by the robot Cassini spacecraft in orbit around Saturn as it swooped past the giant ice ball.\n\nWhat in heavens-above was that? Not everything seen on the night sky is understood. The Night Sky Live (NSL) project keeps its global array of continuously updating web cameras (CONCAMs) always watching the night sky. On the night of 2004 December 17, the fisheye CONCAM perched on top of an active volcano in Haleakala, Hawaii, saw something moving across the night sky that remains mysterious. The NSL team might have disregarded the above streak as unconfirmed, but the Mauna Kea CONCAM on the next Hawaiian island recorded the same thing. The NSL team might then have disregarded the streak as a satellite, but no record of it was found in the heavens-above.com site that usually documents bright satellite events. If you think you have a reasonable explanation for the streak, please contribute to the on-line discussion. Current candidates include a known satellite that was somehow missed by heavens-above, a recently launched rocket, and a passing space rock. Volunteers are solicited by the NSL project to help monitor the operability of each NSL CONCAM, including looking for interesting anomalies such as this. Disclosure: Robert Nemiroff collaborates on both the NSL and APOD projects supernova explosions. The red and blue hues arise from glowing gas heated by the radiation of massive nearby stars. The System.\n\nThis enhanced Hubble Space Telescope image shows in remarkable detail the inner portion of the disk of dust and gas surrounding the star AB Aurigae. Knots of material, visible here for the first time, may well represent an early stage of a process which could result in the formation of planets over the next few million years. AB Aurigae is a young star (2-4 million years old), about 469 light-years distant. Its swirling circumstellar disk is large, about 30 times the size of our solar system. Astronomers believe planet-making is just beginning in AB Aurigae's disk because known disks surrounding younger stars (less than 1 million years old) do not show such clumpy structure, while disks of slightly older stars (aged 8-10 million years) have gaps and features suggesting that planets have already been formed. Why the window pane appearance? Wide black stripes in the picture are caused by occulting bars used to block out the overwhelming starlight. The diagonal streaks are due to diffraction spikes.\n\nThe quasar known as PKS 1127-145 lies ten billion light-years from our fair planet. A Hubble Space Telescope view in the left panel shows this quasar along with other galaxies as they appear in optical light. The quasar itself is the brightest object in the lower right corner. In the right panel is a Chandra Observatory x-ray picture, exactly corresponding to the Hubble field. While the more ordinary galaxies are not seen in the Chandra image, a striking jet, nearly a million light-years long, emerges from the quasar to dominate the x-ray view. Bright in both optical and x-ray light, the quasar is thought to harbor a supermassive black hole which powers the jet and makes PKS 1127-145 visible across the spectrum -- a beacon from the distant cosmos.\n\nRadio waves, like visible light, are electromagnetic radiation and radio telescopes can \"see\" -- their signals translate into radio images of the cosmos. While individually even the largest radio telescopes have very blurry vision compared to their optical counterparts, networks of radio telescopes can combine signals to produce sharper pictures. In fact, using an NRAO supercomputer in New Mexico, USA and technique called VLBI (Very Long Baseline Interferometry), the European network of radio telescopes (EVN) has produced pictures of distant galaxies at a resolution some three times higher than the Hubble Space Telescope. Penetrating obscuring dust, the false-color EVN radio images are inset above according to their relative location in an optical image of the famous Hubble Deep Field region of the sky. (Yellow lines superimposed on the optical image are radio intensity contours from a single telescope.) The bright cosmic radio source in the middle of each inset corresponds to a galaxy. Impressively, the radio sources appear to be so small, less than about 600 light-years across in actual size, that they are thought to be associated with massive central black holes in the distant deep field galaxies.\n\nAn unusual dust disk surrounds nearby star Beta Pictoris. Discovered in 1983, astronomers are still learning just how unusual this disk is. Recent images and computer simulations indicate that the disk contains several elliptical dust rings larger than our own Solar System. The above image taken with the Hubble Space Telescope uncovered evidence of these rings as apparent knots in the edge-on disk. The ring model naturally explains why the disk protrudes longer on one side than the other. These rings might have been formed when a nearby star passed Beta Pic about 100,000 years ago. Astronomers are searching for this intruder star, which is not the foreground star visible in the wider image. Beta Pic is only 50 light-years away and thought to harbor planets.\n\nWinds of fast particles blow out from the Sun, but why? Astronomers came a step closer to answering this question recently by making detailed observations of the high-speed wind source with the space-borne Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO). Images like those shown above isolate regions of inflowing gas, shown in red, and outflowing gas, shown in blue. Particles such as electrons and protons flow out at speeds near 3 million kilometers per hour. This wind will typically enter one of the Sun's coronal holes before flowing out into the Solar System. Analysis indicates that the high-speed wind escapes at the edges of large convection cells, drawn in black. SOHO has recently been revived to run without the use of any orienting gyroscopes.\n\nThe Crab Nebula, filled with mysterious filaments, is the result of a star that exploded in 1054 AD. This spectacular supernova explosion was recorded by Chinese and (quite probably) Anasazi Indian astronomers. The filaments are mysterious because they appear to have less mass than expelled in the original supernova and higher speed than expected from a free explosion. In the above picture, the color indicates what is happening to the electrons in different parts of the Crab Nebula. Red indicates the electrons are recombining with protons to form neutral hydrogen, while green indicates the electrons are whirling around the magnetic field of the inner nebula. In the nebula's very center lies a pulsar: a neutron star rotating, in this case, 30 times a second.\n\nThe famous Sombrero galaxy (M104) is a bright nearby spiral galaxy. The prominent dust lane and halo of stars and globular clusters give this galaxy its name. Something very energetic is going on in the Sombrero's center, as much X-ray light has been detected from it. This X-ray emission coupled with unusually high central stellar velocities cause many astronomers to speculate that a black hole lies at the Sombrero's center - a black hole a billion times the mass of our Sun.\n\nGet ready for one of the most impressive but least anticipated light shows in modern astronomical history. Next month, newly discovered Comet Hyakutake will pass closer to the Earth than any recent comet. Unknown before its discovery by Yuji Hyakutake on 30 January 1996, the fuzzy spot in the above photograph is a comet now predicted to become bright enough to see without a telescope. Although comets act in such diverse ways that predictions are frequently inaccurate, even conservative estimates indicate that this comet is likely to impress. For example, even if Comet Hyakutake remains physically unchanged, its close pass near the Earth in late March 1996 should cause it to appear to brighten to about 3rd magnitude - still bright enough to see with the unaided eye. In the next two months, though, the comet will continue to approach the Sun and hence should become brighter still. Optimistic predictions include that Comet Hyakutake will change physically, develop a larger coma and tail, brighten dramatically, move noticeably in the sky during a single night, and may ultimately become known as the \"The Great Comet of 1996.\" Move over Hale-Bopp!"}

It was a cheap knock-off. It even had a misspelled word in it. :-? I now am a stickler with authenticating the publisher name.\n\nI am trying to verify if your dictionary is a credible source.

Starlike could mean a couple of things, including point like, or twinkling. Luminous means it's radiating visible light.\n\nAs for Galaxy, I assume you're issue is with the idea that all other galaxies are smaller than the Milky Way. While that's a faux pas for sure, the sizes of other nearby galaxies weren't really known until the 40's, I think, and even then it was disputed. Sizes depend on good values for distance after all, and those are very hard to get. So, it's quite possible that they simply copied an older definition.\n\nGalaxy, with a capital G, is defined as the Milky Way.\n\nAlso, in terms of general use, there's really no reason for cheaper dictionaries to go to authorities to get technical definitions of things.As an old-timer, I'd have to point out that this is the standard, \"classical\" descriotion of a comet's visual appearance. If the coma were starlike, how would anyone have thought of a nucleus? The coma is spatially resolved or they would have been hard-pressed to know something is a comet. And \"nucleus\" was longstanding terminology for the starlike thing in the middle of the coma, even though it wasn't until (late 1983?) that the first bare nucleus (Halley inbound) was actually observed. The \"luminous\" part is more debatable, I suppose.\n\nThat reminds me I should one day start a long-contemplated thread on how much contemporary astronomy might be Bad based on lessons from history, but that needs to start with many more references checked...\n\nII checked a few at  and about half do mention the word \"hydrocarbon\".\n\nIn a dictionary, I would not expect to find out about the composition and formation in detail. I contribute to the wiktionary, and was criticised for saying that tropical hardwood faded due to exposure to UV. Describing that it can be silver is good; why sometimes its silver and other times its brown is too much detail.\n\nWhat I would expect to find in the dictionary, but not in the encyclopedia, is a pronunciation guide, usage notes and synonyms with regionalisms, the etymology of the word, different word forms, and examples of the word used in sentences. And a link to the encyclopedia article.\n\nI cannot site specific examples in 1950s books right now, but I remember an old idea that spiral galaxies can pass through each other without disruption. Actually they probably meant without stellar collisions despite billions of stars. This idea is illustrated in an award-winning and splendid old Canadian film titled \"Universe.\" The idea fails to consider the collisions of vast gas clouds within the galaxies, and the resultant intense star making activity. Many galaxies have also been seen that are in various stages of disruption due to gravitational interactions, near misses and direct collisions. It\u00eds a puzzling notion to me because even in the 1940s/50s disrupted galaxies were seen."}

{"text": "Tuesday, January 12, 2010\n\nBy using interferometry, an international team led by an astronomer of Paris Observatory (LESIA) obtained an unprecedented image of the surface of the red supergiant Betelgeuse, in the constellation of Orion. The image reveals the presence of two giant bright spots, whose size is equivalent to the distance Earth-Sun: they cover a large fraction of the surface. It is a first strong and direct indication of the presence of phenomena of convection, transport of heat by the moving matter, in a star other than the Sun. This result allows to better understand the structure and the evolution of supergiants.\n\nBetelgeuse is a red supergiant located in the constellation of Orion. This star is quite different from our Sun: 600 times larger in dimension, it radiates approximately 100 000 times more energy. But following the Sun, this type of object also reveals a surface with bright and dark spots, i.e. hotter and colder spots. These structures would be mainly due to the phenomenon of convection, i.e. the transport of heat by the matter currents. This phenomenon is observed every day in the boiling water. On the surface of the Sun, these spots are rather well-known and visible. However, it is not at all the case for other stars and in particular the supergiants. The size, the physical characteristics and the life time of these dynamical structures remain unknown.\n\nFigure 1: The surface of Betelgeuse in near infrared at 1.64 micron in wavelength, obtained with the interferometre IOTA (Arizona). The image has been re-constructed with two different algorithms, which yield the same details, of 9 mas (milli-arcsecond). The star diametre is about 40 mas.\n\nOther images of less quality, of Betelgeuse surface had already been obtained in the past. They were primarily models of the surface constrained from the interferometric data. Now, the researchers have a true image whose richness exceeds what is possible to imagine from a model. For the first time, one can say that two spots are present and determine the size of the largest. Perhaps this difference in dimension correspond to different physical phenomena.\n\nThe analysis of the brightness of the spots shows a variation of 500 degrees compared to the average temperature of the star (3 600 Kelvins). The largest of the two structures has a dimension equivalent to the quarter of the star diametre (or one and a half the distance Earth-Sun). This marks a clear difference with the Sun where the cells of convection are much finer and reach hardly 1/20th of the solar radius (a few Earth radius). These characteristics are compatible with the idea of luminous spots produced by the convection. These results constitute a first strong and direct indication of the presence of convection on the surface of a star other than the Sun."}

As said researchers in the new photo, bright white areas highlight areas where large stars have recently formed out of such clouds. These clumps are particularly evident in the right-hand side of the image, which shows a chaotic network of filaments. Dense knots of gas and dust mark places where these filaments meet and collapse to form new stars, and where these stars' powerful radiation carves out gigantic bubble-like structures. In the center of the picture, intense radiation from stars undetected at Herschel's wavelengths has partly cleared and heated interstellar material, which glows blue in this representation. The small red blobs scattered throughout the image map out the relatively cold seeds of future stars.

{"text": "Milky Way's black hole gets extreme close-up\n\nThe Milky Way's central black hole may not be able to hide for much longer. Observations have been made three times closer to the centre of our galaxy than ever before, strengthening the case that a supermassive black hole lurks there.\n\nThe Milky Way's centre hosts a bright object called SgrA*, which may be a disc of swirling gas and dust surrounding a heavyweight black hole.\n\nMeasuring the size and shape of SgrA* could help confirm the existence of the black hole. But a blur of clouds between the galactic centre and the Earth has prevented astronomers from getting a clear view of the object's shape.\n\nNow, a team has managed to get three times closer than previous studies in viewing SgrA*. They did it by looking for the object's higher frequency radio signals, which cut through intervening gas and dust.\n\nLinked telescopes\n\nThe size of SgrA* suggests the matter it contains is about 10 times denser than previous measurements, bolstering the idea that the object harbours a black hole, says astronomer Sheperd Doeleman of MIT's Haystack Observatory: \"Our results are more evidence that we are looking at a black hole.\"\n\nTo image SgrA*, Doeleman and colleagues linked radio telescopes in Hawaii, Arizona, and California to create a telescope that was effectively 4500 kilometres wide. They used it to zoom in on the bright centre of the Milky Way with a resolution 1000 times that of Hubble Space Telescope.\n\nSo far, the team cannot produce dramatic pictures of SgrA*. But Doeleman says the technique could allow astronomers to clearly discern the shape of the disc within three to five years.\n\nThat's because future radio telescopes, such as Chile's Atacama Large Millimetre Array, due to become operational in 2010, will allow astronomers to use even shorter wavelengths to pierce through the galaxy's dust.\n\nBlack hole shadow\n\nThe images could reveal whether SgrA* has a 'shadow', a region in its centre where light is dimmed and reddened because it is pulled towards the black hole.\n\nIf SgrA* is indeed a disc of material swirling into the black hole, future observations could reveal how it is aligned.\n\nAstronomers expect it may not spin in the plane of the Milky Way, since that would hint that the black hole at the disc's centre is actually the result of the merger of two galaxies. After the galaxies merged, their central black holes would have united as well, and the galaxy's gravity might not have had enough time to pull the disc around them into alignment with the galactic disc.\n\nFurther observations could measure elusive features, like the black hole's spin, by tracking the progress of flares of radiation - created when matter collides with the black hole - that whip around as the black hole spinsMilky Way's Black Hole Gets Extreme Close-up\n\nWed Sep 03 22:07:44 BST 2008 by Chris Wininger\n\nGood science doesnt usually make good press.

{"text": "That may not sound so huge on its face, but it actually is the first high-resolution simulation of its kind that has turned out a galaxy similar to the Milky Way, and it has rescued the prevailing \"cold dark matter\" cosmological model of how our disc galaxy formed from a good deal of doubt.\n\nThat doubt arose from the fact that when previous, lower-resolution models were run based on that cosmological model, a huge central bulge emerged in the galaxy--a bulge that is absent from all but the center of the Milky Way (another way of saying that: there was more bulge and less disc, whereas the Milky way is more disc, less bulge). This had some physicists thinking that perhaps there was a flaw in the cosmological model itself, which seemed incapable of producing via simulation the flat, spiral-armed qualities consistent with observations of our galaxy.\n\nTags\n\nBut the problem wasn't with the model, it turns out, but with the simulation of star formation. In reality, star formation happens in clusters, where dense clouds of gas feed the process of star birth in fairly tightly defined regions. But in low-resolution simulations(resolution in this sense means the ability to track individual particles), gas densities tended to spread out over relatively large areas, showing stars forming throughout the galaxy rather than in clusters. This led to a larger galactic bulge--and a less accurate picture of how Milky Way-like galaxies came into being.\n\nTo get the high resolution necessary to make the model work took a great deal of computing power, including 1.4 million processor-hours on NASA's Pleiades supercomputer as well as additional time on supercomputers at UC Santa Barbara and the Swiss National Supercomputing Center. And at the time, the researchers had no idea if their added resolution would really make a difference.\n\nIt turns out it did. The simulated galaxy, Eris, shares the shape, bulge-to-disk ratio, star content, brightness, and various other characteristics with the Milky Way, demonstrating that the \"cold dark matter\" model can produce spiral-armed disc galaxies like the one we call home after all.\n\n22 Comments\n\nThis is amazing.

This is made possible by analysing the tiny distortions imprinted on the photons of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) by the gravitational lensing effect of massive cosmic structures. As photons travelled through these structures, which consist primarily of dark matter, their paths became bent, slightly changing the pattern of the CMB. Although noisy, this image is the first measurement performed over almost the whole sky of the gravitational potential that distorts the CMB, and is one of the highlights of Planck's cosmological results. With these unique data, cosmologists can investigate 13 billion years of the formation of structure in the Universe. The data agree very well with the expectations from the leading cosmological model that describes the origin and evolution of cosmic structure in the Universe.(author unknown) at the centre of our own Milky Way Galaxy.(author unknown)"}
{"text": "Giant magnetic loop sweeps through space between stellar pair\n\nThis is the first time astronomers have seen a feature like this in the magnetic field of any star other than the Sun. Provided by NRAO, Socorro, New Mexico\n\nPublished:\nJanuary 14, 2010\n\nArtist's conception of Algol star system with radio image superimposed on grid.\n\nPhoto by Peterson et al., NRAO/AUI/NSF\n\nJanuary 14, 2010 Astron\"This is the first time we've seen a feature like this in the magnetic field of any star other than the Sun,\" said William Peterson, of the University of Iowa.\n\nThe pair, 93 light-years from Earth, includes a star about three times more massive than the Sun and a less-massive companion, orbiting it at a distance of 5.8 million miles, only about six percent of the distance between Earth and the Sun. The newly discovered magnetic loop emerges from the poles of the less-massive star and stretches outward in the direction of the primary star. As the secondary star orbits its companion, one side \u2014 the side with the magnetic loop \u2014 constantly faces the more-massive star, just as the same side of our Moon always faces Earth.\n\nThe scientists detected the magnetic loop by making extremely detailed images of the system using an intercontinental set of radio telescopes, including the National Science Foundation's Very Long Baseline Array, Very Large Array, and Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope, along with the Effelsberg radio telescope in Germany. These radio telescopes were used as a single observing system that offered both great detail, or resolving power, and high sensitivity to detect very faint radio waves. When working together, these telescopes are known as the High Sensitivity Array.\n\nAlgol, in the constellation Perseus, is visible to the naked eye and well known to amateur astronomers. As seen from Earth, the two stars regularly pass in front of each other, causing a notable change in brightness. The pair completes a cycle of such eclipses in less than three days, making it a popular object for amateur observers. In 1667, an Italian astronomer discovered the variability in brightness, and the eclipsing-binary explanation was confirmed in 1889.\n\nThe newly discovered magnetic loop helps explain phenomena seen in earlier observations of the Algol system at X-ray and radio wavelengths, the scientists said. In addition, they now believe there may be similar magnetic features in other double-star systems.\n\nObserve the news!

Kashlinsky et al.\n\nAlong with dark matter and dark energy, astronomers can now add\ndark flow to the lexicon of cosmic mysteries. Researchers have\ndiscovered that 700 distant clusters of galaxies, gas, and dust are\nall being pulled in the same direction, apparently toward something\ninvisible and possibly very large, confounding current cosmological\nmodels. So far, what that \"something\" is remains speculative, but\nit could turn out to be a vestige of the universe's earliest\ndays.\n\nShortly after the big bang occurred some 13.7 billion years ago,\ncosmologists think, the universe underwent a brief period that\ndefied current physical laws. The theory goes that during this\ntime, called inflation, space itself expanded at a rate much, much\nfaster than the speed of light. As a result, some of the matter\nformed with the big bang was pulled more than 13.7 billion\nlight-years away--so far that its light hasn't reached us yet. As a\nresult, that matter can't be observed--or at least, so cosmologists\nthought.\n\nBut now a team led by astrophysicist Alexander Kashlinsky of\nNASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, has\nunearthed what could be indirect evidence of inflation. The\nresearchers had been surveying the motion of 700 clusters of\ngalaxies to test an unrelated astronomical phenomenon when they\nmade a startling discovery: All 700 clusters are flowing basically\nin the same direction and at speeds of as much as 1000 kilometers\nper second--or more than 30 times faster than Earth revolves around\nthe sun. As the team reports in this week's online edition of\nAstrophysical Journal Letters, the clusters, which appear\nheaded toward a region of the sky where the constellation Centaurus\nresides, are moving faster than they should be if their\nacceleration were due only to dark energy, the mysterious force\ndiscovered a decade ago that is slowly ripping the cosmos\napart.\n\nIt was \"a huge surprise,\" says astrophysicist and co-author\nHarald Ebeling of the University of Hawaii, Honolulu. The big\nquestion, he says, is what is generating the flow. The volume of\ngalaxy clusters affected is much too big to be reacting to some\nsingle, massive object, Ebeling says. Instead, the team speculates\nthat the flow is moving the clusters toward an irregularity in the\nmass distribution of the universe that was already in place before\ninflation began. If so, Ebeling says, the flow should extend even\nfarther across the universe, and the researchers could have the\nanswer when they examine the motion of an even larger and deeper\ncatalog of close to 1500 galaxy clusters. \"We should know more in a\nfew years,\" he adds.\n\nIt's an \"intriguing\" finding, says astrophysicist Mike Hudson of\nthe University of Waterloo in Ontario, Canada. Hudson, who with\ncolleagues has submitted a related paper of his own observations to\nthe Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, says\nthe direction of the flow agrees \"very well\" with his own findings,\nthough those of Kashlinsky's team cover a greater distance and have\nfound a much greater velocity. Hudson recommends awaiting\nconfirmation of the results by other groups using other surveys,\nbut \"if this result holds up, then theorists will certainly have to\nmake some major revisions to the standard cosmological model.\""}
{"text": "30 Doradus is better known as the Tarantula nebula and is located 170,000 light years away within the Milky Way's largest satellite galaxy the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC).\n\nThe image shows a region of space approximately 650 light years across with several million stars present within. Combined, the sum total of the stars' masses shown in this image would be well over a million times the mass of our own Sun.\n\nThe stars are grouped into smaller clusters ranging in age from about 2 million \u2013 25 million years old, whilst this may sound ancient in human terms as far as the universe is concerned even the oldest star in the region is a newcommer.\n\nThe brightest cluster is NGC 2070 being one of the youngest (between 2 and 3 million years old) and most actively starforming regions with the larger structure Astronomers find it an attractive region to study. Recently in fact, it was revealed that at the heart of the cluster (which contains upwards of half a million stars) there is a dense clump of stars designated RMC 136 where the largest stars yet discovered reside. Indeed several of these monsters are more than 100 times the mass of our own sun, truly cosmic giants.\n\nThe fierce output of the regions hot stars sculpts the regions gas and just into the fantastic arcs and bubbles we can see in the image. The fierce radiation bombardment of radiation is also exciting the gas and dust molecules of the nebula making them glow in their own right and classing the region as an emission nebula.\n\nThe image is composed of data from both Hubble and the ESO's MPG/ESO 2.2-metre telescope and represents the one of the largest such mosaics in existence today. The data was captured by both telescopes during an observing run in October 2011.\n\nThe region is a nebula composed mainly of hydrogen and it is using this hydrogen to create new stars of all masses.\n\nNot long ago, (by astronomical terms of course!) the nebula would have been cold and dark as the newly forming stars had yet to break out of their gaseous progenitors. The most massive and thus hottest newborn stars have now blasted through the clouds of dust and gas that surrounded them, subjecting the surrounding nebula to a fierce stream of ultraviolet radiation that is eroding the larger structure and making it fluoresce in response. This fluorescence makes the nebula an emission nebula as it is emitting its own light rather than just reflecting that of the stars it contains.\n\nAnalysis of the data indicates that the majority of this radiation comes from one star. It is the bright star visible near the centre of the image.\n\nOnly the largest stars have currently emerged from their nurseries with many smaller, perhaps more sun like stars remain hidden within their denser pockets of the nebula.\n\nNGC 2467 is like many other star forming regions including the more famous Orion Nebula. NGC 2467 is located around 13,000 light years from Earth with the Orion Nebula around 10,000 light years away.\n\nThe Nebula is located in the constellation Puppis which is completely visible to residents of the southern hemisphere (those in the northern hemisphere can observe the northern section of the constellation however it sits close to the horizon)\n\nThe image is a combination of several taken with the HST's Wide Field Channel in several filters. The images where collected by the telescope all the way back in 2004As we prepare to announce the results of this year's competition tomorrow it seems fitting that last year's results are published now.\n\nSo lets take a fond look back at some of the many wondrous astronomical images 2010 brought us -\n\nThe best image of a body within our Solar System 2010 was-\n\nEnceladus Credit: NASA Cassini\n\nEnceladus captured by NASA's Cassini Orbiter.\n\nIt captures the beauty of Saturn's moon Enceladus. Despite being only 500 kilometres in diameter Enceladus is a dynamic world with cryovolcanic processes in action that create huge geysers spouting high above the moon wherever they can find a weak point in the frozen surface.\n\nSeveral of these geysers have been captured in this image, and it is these features that exposed Enceladus to be more than a ball of ice.\n\nThis stunning galaxy is a face on spiral, located around 68 million light years from us here on Earth. It lies within the Northern constellation Ursa Major (The Great Bear).\n\nThe galaxy displays beautiful clouds of active hydrogen gas (pink spots), new formed star clusters (blue spots) and lashings of dust lanes which will one day collapse to form the next generation of stars.These features, combined with the galaxy's beautiful spiral arms, make the galaxy a stunning sight.\n\nDespite its beauty the galaxy is somewhat petit being a 'mere' 30,000 light years across which makes it 1/3 the size of our our galaxy the Milky Way.\n\nThe image was created using exposures obtained between 2000 and 2009 by Hubble's Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2), the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS), and the Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3).\n\nFinally the one you have all been waiting for the best image outside our Solar System though within the Milky Way, which is also the best image overall 2010 is -\n\nLagoon Nebula Credit: NASA; ESA\n\nThe Lagoon Nebula as seen by Hubble.\n\nThe nebula is located somewhere between 4,000 and 5,000 light years from the Earth and lies in the constellation Sagittarius (meaning it is in the direction of the centre of our galaxy).\n\nThe image is a close up of the gas and dust near the centre of the nebula. It is being illuminated by the fierce ultraviolet light of young, high mass stars nearby making the gas and dust glow and emit their own light allowing the nebula to be classed as an emission nebula rather than a reflection nebula like DC 129. The nebula is a huge star producing factory(over 100 light years across) with its clouds slowly collapsing into the next generation of stars.\n\nSome of these new stars are trying to absorb more material than they can stomach and the result is a stream of material being blown out at their poles (by bi-polar outflow for those interested), called Herbig-Haro objects. Several new such objects have been discovered in the nebula in recent years allowing astronomers to gain a deeper insight into how young stars form and interact with their environment.\n\nThis image carries spectacular detail showing 'tiny' ripples in the nebula making its maritime name seem fitting. Unlike the patterns on the surface of the sea, these are not caused by tides or the wind, but by the immense power of ultraviolet radiation blowing away the gas and dust that forms the nebula. The patterns result from tiny differences in the density of the gas making some sections harder to blow away than others.\n\nIf you are lucky enough to live away from light pollution and have clear skies it is possible to see the Lagoon nebula with your own eyes as a fuzzy grey patch in the Milky Way, though it takes a reasonable sized telescope to make out any details.\n\nThe image was captured by Hubble's Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) and shows hydrogen in red. Light from ionised nitrogen in green and light through a yellow filter in blue.\n\nTo make up for the long gap between the recent images of the week, here is another!\n\nLambda Centauri Credit: ESO\n\nThe Lambda Centauri nebula is more commonly known as the Running Chicken nebula (or IC 2944) thanks to the fluke alignment of gas within.\n\nIt is an emission nebula glowing from the harsh bombardment of the ultraviolet light produced by the hot young stars that have been birthed by the nebula's dusty clouds. The red glow indicates the familiar presence of excited hydrogen, a feature common in and around such star forming emission nebulae.\n\nStar formation is evidenced further by the presence of Bok Globules \u2013 the dark black objects in the image particularly concentrated in the top right corner around the cluster of bright blue stars. These are small dense regions of gas and dust that are collapsing to form the next generation of stars.\n\nThese particular Bok Globules have received particular attention. They are known as Thackeray's Globules in homage to their discoverer Andrew David Thackeray, a South American astronomer who identified the globules in 1950 and famously observed by the Hubble Space Telescope.\n\nThackeray's Globules Credit: NASA/ESA and The Hubble Heritage Team STScI/AURA)\n\nEventually the stars within these globules will erode the cocoon of surrounding material and will reveal themselves to the universe.\n\nUnfortunately, such beautiful emission nebulae are short lived in astronomical terms, lasting just a few million years before their gas has either been used to forge stars or blown out from the area by fierce stellar winds. The most massive of stars will burn out in flashes as they rapidly chew through their supply of hydrogen briefly lighting up the area again as a supernova and glowing remnant.\n\nThe main image was produced using data from the Wide Field Imager on the MPG/ESO 2.2-metre telescope at ESO's La Silla Observatory."}

Lower-energy X-ray observations by NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory and infrared data from the Keck telescope in Hawaii confirmed the outburst. The Milky Way's black hole had just swallowed ... something.\n\nBlack hole snacks are a violent process in which the \"meal\" is ripped apart by powerful tides and heated to millions of degrees as it slides down the gullet of the gravitational singularity. In this case, NuSTAR picked up X-rays emitted by matter being heated up to about 100 million degrees Celsius.\n\nThe observation raises hopes that astronomers will be able to solve a long-standing mystery: Why is the Milky Way's supermassive black hole such a picky eater?\n\nCompared to giant black holes at the centers of other galaxies, the Milky Way's is relatively quiet. More active black holes tend to gobble up matter in prodigious quantities. Ours, on the other hand, is thought only to nibble or not eat at all.\n\nAsteroids could be a primary food source. One model holds that trillions of asteroids surround the Milky Way's core. Astronomers using the Chandra X-ray Observatory have indeed detected flares consistent with asteroids 10 km wide or larger falling into the black hole.\n\nThese space rocks would be about the same size as the asteroid that wiped out the dinosaurs on Earth 65 million years ago. Smaller space rocks might be falling in, too, but their flares would be too weak for Chandra to detect.\n\nNuSTAR brings something new to the problem. With its unprecedented ability to detect and make focused images of X-ray flares, the telescope will almost certainly help astronomers understand what's happening deep in the core of our galaxy. The monster's menu might soon be revealed.\n\nFor more information about NuSTAR and its focused observations of black holes, visit the mission's home page here\n\nFailed explosions explain most peculiar supernovae Chicago IL (SPX) Nov 23, 2012\nSupercomputer simulations have revealed that a type of oddly dim, exploding star is probably a class of duds-one that could nonetheless throw new light on the mysterious nature of dark energy.

{"text": "1.2. Thermal history of the Universe and the CMBR\n\nThe origins of the CMBR lie in an early hot phase of the expansion of\nthe Universe, where the details of its generation are erased by the\nclose coupling of radiation and matter. Later energy\nreleases, interactions with matter at different temperatures,\nand other effects can modify the spectrum and brightness distribution\nof the CMBR. Cosmological data on the gross properties of the\nUniverse are contained in the integrated properties of the CMBR, such\nas the spectrum and the large-scale brightness structure. Detailed\ninformation about the properties and formation of present-day objects,\nsuch as clusters of galaxies, is encoded in the small-scale\nstructures in the brightness.\n\nA critical stage in the development of the CMBR occurs when the\nexpansion of the Universe causes the temperature to drop to about\n3000 K. At earlier times (higher redshifts), matter and\nradiation were in good thermal contact because of the abundance of\nfree electrons. But at this stage the number of free electrons drops\nrapidly as matter becomes neutral, and the radiation and matter become\nthermally decoupled, so that the temperatures of the photon and matter\nfluids evolve almost independently.

At some time\nabout then, most of the photons that are now in the\ncosmic background radiation were scattered by electrons for the last\ntime, and we often refer to a sphere of last scattering or\nredshift of last scattering at this epoch.\n\nOne of the important changes that occurred during this period, because\nof the change in the interactions of photons and electrons, was that\nthe length scale on which gravitational collapse can occur dropped\ndramatically, so that fluctuations in the mass density that were\nstabilized by the radiation field before recombination became unstable\nafter recombination, and were able to collapse (slowly - the\nexpansion of the Universe causes the collapse of gravitationally bound\nobjects to be power-law rather than exponential in time:\nLandau & Lifshitz 1962;\nsee descriptions in\nKolb & Turner 1990).\nMatter\nover-densities and under-densities present at recombination, and which\nlater became the large-scale objects that we see in the present-day\nUniverse, such as clusters of galaxies,\ncaused fluctuations in the intensity of the radiation field through\ntheir gravitational perturbations (the Sachs-Wolfe effect;\nSachs & Wolfe 1967),\nthrough thermodynamic fluctuations in the density of\nradiation coupled to the matter, and through Doppler shifts due to\nmotions of the surface of last scattering.

{"text": "A European research team has published the results of a 30-year study of an extraordinary hypergiant star. They have found that the surface temperature of the super-luminous star HR 8752 increased by about 3000 degrees in less than three decades, while it went through an extremely rare stage called the 'Yellow Evolutionary Void'. The discovery marks an important step closer to unravelling the evolution of the most massive stars.\n\nA team of astronomers from six European countries, including the Royal Observatory of Belgium (ROB), has investigated the hypergiant star HR 8752 for 30 years while it traversed the 'Yellow Evolutionary Void'. The 'Void' is a short stage in the lives of the most massive stars when they become very unstable. The team finds that the surface temperature of HR 8752 rose surprisingly fast from 5000 to 8000 degrees in less than 30 years. The research results were very recently published in the journal Astronomy and Astrophysics. The discovery is an important step forward to resolve the enigma of the hypergiants, the most luminous and massive stars of the Galaxy.\n\nHypergiants can shine millions of times brighter than the Sun, and they often have a diameter several hundred times greater. HR 8752 is a quarter million times more luminous than the Sun. The powerhouse is therefore visible with normal binoculars at large distance from the Earth in the Northern constellation of Cassiopeia. There are currently only 12 hypergiants known in our Galaxy.\n\nThe 'Yellow Evolutionary Void' is a unique stage in the short life of a hypergiant when its temperature and luminosity can quickly change. The team has discovered that the atmospheres are very unstable inside the Void because outwardly directed forces act equal or sometimes even stronger than the force of gravity. Due to the unstable atmosphere, hypergiants lose tremendous weight in this 'forbidden zone', which can sometimes amount to the mass of the Sun in a year. When a hypergiant enters the 'Evolutionary Void' the star tries to it leave as quickly as possible. That is why almost all hypergiants are found outside the Void.\n\nThe team finds that HR 8752 is a very rare hypergiant which has partly traversed the Void. The changes of its atmosphere were closely monitored with regular observations over 30 years.\n\nAlex Lobel, co-author of the study and ROB scientist explains that \"HR 8752 was around 1980 identical to the eruptive hypergiant Rho Cas of spectral type F, but then the temperature of HR 8752's atmosphere rapidly increased by 3000 degrees and now shows the spectral properties of a hotter A-type star. We are baffled about the tremendous changes of HR 8752 in that period of time.\"\n\nHR 8752 had to struggle through the Void which has changed the physical properties of its atmosphere\", Lobel adds.\n\nThe team further demonstrates that the Void actually consists of two parts in which the atmosphere of the hypergiant is unstable. They result from ionization of large amounts of hydrogen and helium gas in the atmosphere, divided by a small zone around 8000 degrees where it becomes more stable.\n\nThe fate of HR 8752 is currently unclear but there are strong hints that these massive hypergiants may perish in a powerful supernova explosion. Or they quickly traverse the Void and transform into a hotter type of erratic stars known as the \"Luminous Blue Variables\". In either case that will not pass unnoticed according to Kees de Jager and Hans Nieuwenhuijzen, the astronomers of the Netherlands Institute for Space Research in Utrecht who directed the research of HR 8752 over the past three decades.\n\nThe discovery is an important new step for explaining the existence of these extreme stars. A number of other hypergiants with similar spectacular properties is expected to exist in the Milky Way. The search for these remarkable stars with dramatic changes over human timescales has just begun, but has been forever put on track.\n\nRelated Stories\n\n(Phys.org)\u2014A team of scientists from six European countries reported today they have finalized a thirty years long investigation of a hypergiant star that crossed the Yellow Evolutionary Void.

These bright pulsating stars are used as standard candles to measure distances out to more remote galaxies and to determine the expansion rate of the Universe \u2014 the Hubble Constant. This in turn is the basis for surveying the Universe out to the most distant galaxies that can be seen with current telescopes. So the more accurate distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud immediately reduces the inaccuracy in current measurements of cosmological distances.\n\nThe astronomers worked out the distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud by observing rare close pairs of stars, known as eclipsing binaries. As these stars orbit each other they pass in front of each other. When this happens, as seen from Earth, the total brightness drops, both when one star passes in front of the other and, by a different amount, when it passes behind.\n\nBy tracking these changes in brightness very carefully, and also measuring the stars' orbital speeds, it is possible to work out how big the stars are, their masses and other information about their orbits. When this is combined with careful measurements of the total brightness and colours of the stars remarkably accurate distances can be found.\n\nMurakami's new backlist design uses the circle as a central motif and the palette is limited to red, black and off-white.

The space oddity was spied in 2007 by Dutch high-school teacher Hanny van Arkel while participating in the online Galaxy Zoo project. The cosmic blob, called Hanny's Voorwerp (Hanny's Object in Dutch), appears to be a solitary green island floating near a normal-looking spiral galaxy, called IC 2497. Since the discovery, puzzled astronomers have used a slew of telescopes, including X-ray and radio observatories, to help unwrap the mystery. Astronomers found that Hanny's Voorwerp is the only visible part of a 300-light-year-long gaseous streamer stretching around the galaxy. The greenish Voorwerp is visible because a searchlight beam of light from the galaxy's core illuminated it. This beam came from a quasar, a bright, energetic object that is powered by a black hole. An encounter with another galaxy may have fed the black hole and pulled the gaseous streamer from IC 2497. Now, with the help of NASA's Hubble Space Telescope, astronomers have uncovered a pocket of young star clusters (colored yellow-orange in the image) at the tip of the green-colored Hanny's Voorwerp.\""}

It's many times larger and more massive than our own galaxy, the Milky Way.\n\nA black hole sits in the center of the galaxy. Most estimates say it's about three billion times as massive as the Sun. Those estimates are based in part on the motions of stars around the galaxy's center.\n\nBut galaxies consist of more than just stars. In fact, most of their mass consists of dark matter -- matter that we can't see, but that exerts a gravitational pull on the visible matter around it.\n\nTexas astronomer Karl Gebhardt recalculated the mass of the black hole by including the galaxy's dark matter. The results showed that the black hole is more than twice as massive as previously thought -- about seven billion times the mass of the Sun.\n\nNow, Gebhardt and others are studying M87 with an instrument that's designed to look for dark energy. Its observations will provide a better look at how the stars of M87 move -- providing better measurements of M87's dark matter and dark heart"}

{"text": "Friday, February 08, 2013 The Spins of Black Holes in Galactic Nuclei Supermasssive black holes, having masses of millions or even billions of\nsuns, are found at the nuclei of galaxies. In dramatic cases like quasars, these black holes are responsible for spectacular phenomena like the ejection of narrow jets of particles at nearly the speed of light. These outflows, discovered at radio wavelengths, are thought to\nbe driven by matter accreting onto a hot disk around the black hole. A black hole, although thought to be point-like in dimension, is surrounded by an imaginary surface, or \"edge,\" of finite size (its\n\"event horizon\") within which anything that ventures becomes lost forever to the rest of the universe. But black holes can be ringed by disks of matter, and when infalling material interacts with the disk,\nradiation and matter can be ejected.\n\nA black hole is so simple that it can be completely described by only three parameters: its mass, its spin, and its electric charge, but determining these values is not simple. The charge is usually considered to be negligibly small and neglected in modeling. The mass can be found when the black hole has orbiting material or companions from the\nperiodic orbital motions. The spin is derived from modeling the shape of emission lines, for example from iron, a very abundant species. The atoms rotate in the disk around the black hole, some close to the minimum possible orbit before being captured; the rotation of the disk\nmeasured by these atoms in turn reflects the rotation of the black hole itself.\n\nCfA astronomer E. Nardini and four colleagues used the Japanese Suzaku\nX-ray satellite to complete a unique, systematic study of twenty-five galaxies with active nuclei whose black holes are vigorously accreting material and heating their surroundings. The scientists chose a sample of galaxies seen face-on with little or no dust along the line-of-sight to the nucleus that could diminish the radiation and thereby complicate the analysis. The astronomers modeled both the X-ray emission from the continuum and from hot atoms in these galaxies, and report two significant conclusions. First, most of the supermassive black holes are indeed rapidly rotating. As material accretes onto a black hole it can either increase the rotation (if it is an ordered and gradual process) or decrease the rotation (if the infall is more random), and therefore this conclusion implies that the feeding of nuclear black holes was a steady and ordered process. Secondly, in a related point, they conclude that the strength of the radio emission of a galactic nucleus is not directly related to the black hole spin."}

{"text": "A new study using data from NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory points to the origin of a famous supernova. This supernova, discovered in 1604 by Johannes Kepler, belongs to an important class of objects that are used to measure the rate of expansion of the universe.\n\nAstronomers have used a very long Chandra observation of the remnant of Kepler's supernova to deduce that the supernova was triggered by an interaction between a white dwarf and a red giant star. This is significant because another study has already shown that a so-called Type Ia supernova caused the Kepler supernova remnant.\n\nThe thermonuclear explosion of a white dwarf star produces such supernovas. Because they explode with nearly uniform brightness, astronomers have used them as cosmic distance markers to track the accelerated expansion of the universe.\n\n\"While we can't speak to all Type Ia supernovas, our evidence points to Kepler being caused by a white dwarf pulling material from a companion star, and not the merger of two white dwarfs,\" said the first author of the new Chandra study, Mary Burkey of North Carolina State University (NCSU). \"To continue improving distance measurements with these supernovas, it is crucial to understand how they are triggered.\"\n\nThe Kepler supernova remnant is one of only a few Type Ia supernovas known to have exploded in the Milky Way galaxy. Its proximity and its identifiable explosion date make it an excellent object to study.\n\n\"Johannes Kepler made such good naked-eye observations in 1604 that we can identify the supernova as Type Ia,\" said co-author Stephen Reynolds, also of NCSU. \"He would be thrilled that we can use today's terrific instruments to reveal the hidden secrets of his supernova.\"\n\nThe new Chandra images reveal a disk-shaped structure near the center of the remnant. The researchers interpret this X-ray emission to be caused by the collision between supernova debris and disk-shaped material that the giant star expelled before the explosion. Another possibility is that the structure is just debris from the explosion.\n\nThe evidence that this disk-shaped structure was left behind by the giant star is two-fold: first, a substantial amount of magnesium - an element not produced in great amounts in Type Ia supernovas - was found in the Kepler remnant. This suggests the magnesium came from the giant companion star.\n\nSecondly, the disk structure seen by Chandra in X-rays bears a remarkable resemblance in both shape and location to one observed by the Spitzer Space Telescope. These infrared-emitting disks are thought to be dusty bands expelled by stars in a wind, rather than material ejected in a supernova.\n\nThe researchers found\n\"One remaining challenge is to find the damaged and fast-moving leftovers of the giant star that was pummeled by the explosion at close quarters,\" said co-author Kazimierz Borkowski, also of NCSU.\n\nMuch of the evidence in the last several years has favored the white dwarf merger scenario for Type Ia supernovas within the Milky Way as well as those found in other galaxies. This result strengthens the case that Type Ia supernovas may have more than one triggering mechanism.\n\nThese results could imply that many Type Ia supernovas have a similar origin, but the authors warn that they are unsure whether Kepler was a typical explosion. For example, a recent analysis based on Chandra data and computer simulations, led by Daniel Patnaude from Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, has suggested that Kepler was an unusually powerful explosion.\n\n\"We could settle the issue of how normal - or abnormal - the Kepler supernova was if we could discover some light from the supernova explosion that just happened to bounce off some interstellar dust to take a few hundred extra years to get here: a light echo,\" said Reynolds. Such light echoes have been found for two other galactic supernovas in the last millennium.\n\nHerschel Discovers Some of the Youngest Stars Ever Seen Washington DC (SPX) Mar 21, 2013\nAstronomers have found some of the youngest stars ever seen thanks to the Herschel space observatory, a European Space Agency mission with important NASA contributions.\nObservations from NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope and the Atacama Pathfinder Experiment (APEX) telescope in Chile, a collaboration involving the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy in Germany, the Onsala Space Observ"}
