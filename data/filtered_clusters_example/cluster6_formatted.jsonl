Which, isn't conducive to a lot of people who're asking me this question.\n\nTo that end, I've gone and built a list of units that 'work best' in any given particular Chapter. For this purpose, these are the units that you typically want to base your army around or have a lot (four or more, usually, or as many as you can get, slots willing), or, which units work best in conjunction with the rest of the units in that Codex.\n\nThe second point to the List, is to make What You Like == What Is Good. Which a lot of new players have a hard time doing.\n\nDisclaimer: Space Marines is Space Marines. While you can build a Codex Marine army with 30 Terminators, a lot of people are going to wonder why you don't do it with Dark Angels instead. This is not a 'competitive' guide and will not tell you how to build an Army List. That is far more specific and you may be more suited to the linked guides above.\n\nThis is all subject to Cheesegear's opinion, and subject to change.\nThey are not written in order of preference.\n\n1. Codex Marine Captains are the 'most' flexible of all Codecies, and, the special character Captains will literally change the way the rest of your army is played.\n2. You will need a Librarian at some point. While many powers are the same across Codecies, they will function better in their typed roles due to the rest of the Codex.\n3. In this case, 'Black Templars' refers to Crusader Squads, which are much the same as Assault Squads minus the Jump Packs with additional rules that make them better in Assault.

From there you can decide if you want to rename them or just go after the image files. Use the .rot viewer, open the files and it'll automatically create a .dds (or .tga) file. Make sure you have the .dds plugins for Photoshop installed, and open it in there. Then you can set about tweaking it. You can use .tga, .dds, or .rot images for fx. I always just use 32-bit .tga.\n\nTo use your new set of colorized effects, you open that .wf file and set the fx you want to change to the appropriate \"top-level cascade\" file. They're usually tagged as \"combo_\" and only have the names of other files in them, none of the other properties you see in the usual files. Most fx will work this way, but I think it's perfectly possible to reference, say, a bullet effect directly, without a combo file. Usually though, you'll want to use combos to get cooler effects. As for which file is referenced in which line...that's rather flagrantly self-explanatory. Bulletfx - bullet effect; hitfx - physical hit; nopenetratefx - shield hit (dff impact?); scartype - scar decal; now deathtype I'm not sure, back in HW1 this was the muzzle effect, though here it might mean the effect run at the end of the weapon's lifetime. Sfx ones are the sound effects for that weapon. I believe you can also add a \"firefx\" line into this file (I would add it by the hit and bullet lines), instead of setting the muzzle in the ship's .events file, and may be able to override it with the muzzle call in the .events file.\n\nThen when we got to the .wf you lost me completly...\nHow does the .wf connect to the .tga file? I couldnt locate that peice of text string. Becuase when i get the hang of it ill make many diffrent colours. BCs with purple... Uber BCs with orange maybe..."}

An end-game ship that can't take part in pretty much the only endgame content we have. Yes, it's a bug, and yes, a fix is coming (apparently), but it does rather beg the question - if the ship wasn't even given the most basic testing in STFs, the content it's most likely to be used in - how was it tested?\n\n3) Piloting an escort-carrier is a really odd experience, it's not like a traditional carrier where the attack craft fly off and do the damage while the slow carrier stays behind coordinating - the escort outruns the fighters, so finding a decent use for them is tricky\n\n2) Thunderchild PDS and Armitage PDS have separate countdowns, and are both on a 3-minute timer, so I can fire off the phasers to wear down shields and then hit the big button of make things go boom.

{"text": "but the Munitorum is bound to get suspicious that you aren't taking good care of your gear (which is punishable by death) if you do it too often.\n\nUnless you're a member of some Gung-Ho Regiment which is usually given the hardest task on the battlefield, suicidal assaults, dangerous infiltration missions or defense to last men alive. In that case even Munitorum can't suspect anything. But if you're Johnny Soldierboy sitting in a trench all damn war and you lose your equipment very often that could lead to accusations and possible death. Thats my oppinion.\n\n\"You know what the chain of command is? It's the chain I go get beat you with until you understand who's in ruttin' command here.\" - Jayne Cobb\n\nI'd just put the starting gear of the speciality as part of that soldier's standard gear, and maybe give them some trouble if they lose it too often (after all, this is not specially requisitioned gear, it's the stuff the Munitorum issues everyone in their position). At the very least, I'd give them sizeable bonuses on Logistic tests to reacquire it, because they aren't asking for anything particular, just to be sent another set of \"standard speciality x\"s gear. Of course, that creates the problem where some one can order his gear for everyone, but the Munitorum is bound to get suspicious that you aren't taking good care of your gear (which is punishable by death) if you do it too often.\n\nGiving the 'favored weapon' +10 to reaquire specialist gear would seem pretty reasonable to me. And as for logic and IG requisitions\u2026 You're kidding right? This is 40k, you're lucky if you order a case of krak grenades and they only send you a case of smoke grenades, as opposed to, say, an untrained sqiggoth that was supposed to be sent to an inquisitorial research base.\n\nUnknown said \"Dont be silly. Otherwise he could order one for every man in the squad. Same thing with heavy flamers. And that would be a frightful wast of the emperors resources.\" The GM could step in at this point and say \"Thats a -60 Will-power test to waist the God Emperor's resources\" \"Why such an agreejus negative to the test?\" The player asks dumfounded \"The only thing your character has cared about sense the death of his parents is the God Emperor of mankind. He sees waisting resources as a bratrail to Him. There for a -60\" \"Can I still get one to replace my broken one for free.\" \"By all means but the guy in the armory knows you have one now. You cant get one til after the next mission and if you have one working there's a WP test.\"Sorry for any mis-speeled words or gramarical errors Im doing this on a PS3.\n\nGo to war? With a lasgun? What the f@ck am I guna kill with a flash light?!\n\nThe thing is that, even a weapon specialist trained for use with flamers and starting with one of these, a heavy gunner with a rocket launcher or similar, a sergeant and so on, is still just an Imperial Guardsman.\n\nThe standard kit is, as described in the book as, the fall back gear. It enough to keep someone fighting, despite being out of ammunition for his otherwise special gear. And it's just for the most part that you do get these things back when you need to replace it. But, a droptrooper regiment who doesn't get their gravchutes simply cannot jump out of a valkyrie without surviving and a mech-infantry can't perform as quickly as normal without their chimeras. A weapon specialist without his flamer is just slightly less dangerous. he can still kill stuff, so he isn't any kind of priority.\n\nnote that even standard regiment gear is mentioned as almost always available, it also mentions that those things are +20 to get if a test is needed.\n\nA commissar doesnt need a boltpistol. but he was probably awarded one at some time. Especially since its considered good quality. If he looses it, shame on him. They don't grow on trees. Keep track of your gear."}
{"text": "Author\nTopic: What do you do with surplus resources? (Read 1812 times)I'm generally building a lot of fallen spire stuff, which eats resources like the cookie monster eats... well, cookies.\n\nBut if the m+c is creeping towards the cap and nothing obvious springs to mind: 1) Fill out any turret cap if I know where I want them. 2) It's time to lay out more space docks, more engies, and speed build a fleet right into the face of whatever AI planet I want dead next. In extreme cases (or youngling/autobomb cases), FRD'ing straight from the docks into the enemy. 3) If I'm really desperate, turn on the ZPG that's generally under construction from the Trader from early in the game. A group of engies can make 2M m+c disappear real fast doing that.\n\nDon't bother with Mercs because they use up energy and are so expensive I'd never dare to send them to the fight. Don't bother with building unnecessary turrets because I don't need them.\n\nSo yeah. My school of thought is ye olde Dock-On-FRD-Into-Enemy-Territory; quite possibly with redirector posts on the enemy world sending them onwards to further locations - thereby keeping multiple systems cleared.\n\nI always use my spare resources to build martyrs. Can't have enough of them. or send my botnet to some enemy worlds to make some extra zombies, meaning I will have to repair the botnet after. That'll drain your resources.\n\nWhen I build mercs I usually just let them sit deep into my territory until I have a sizeable force. They cost a lot, but don't underestimate the beam frigates, they will give you a huge edge if you get more than a few.\n\nOn another note, it would be awesome if you could randomize the non triangle ships available from the merc shipyard every game (or atleast the option to randomize). It has gone far enough for me to expect the beam frigate to be a part of my army late game, the phantom 4th member of the triangle you could call it, though it's probably because of my turtle like playstyle which allows me to get them almost every game, but still...\n\nSit on it and wait 5 minutes. If I still don't need it, wait 5 minutes more. If I'm still at 1M each, build a fort. That deals with that for 30 minutes. Why? Half my fleet died while I was building it.\n\nMercs are too expensive. Z Gen I go out of my way to build or ignore utterly. My money's in motion. If it's not, I'm already playing wrong or I need to wait a few minutes.\n\nStarships, ZPG, Mercs - Yes, they're expensive. however, mixed in decent amounts with your fleet ball, I lose very few of these. Even when going at Mark IV worlds I never lose more than maybe 10-20 of each type if I have them all loaded, and that's under poor conditions. They require a huge investment and patience to not be tempted to take the few of them you do already have and send 'em into battle too early. And i fthat fails... FRD Space Doc Assaults.\n\nForts and mercs will use up money fast. You can scrap the fort later and get an infusion of emergency resources if you need it.\n\nIf my cash is like 800k or above I'll build mercs, and stop when it gets down to a few hundred K. Who cares how much they cost? Mercs are much more cost effective than wasting unused cash. If you don't play really fast and aggressive you are probably gonna make use of mercs, since you'll probably hit resource cap a lot. Don't be scared to use them, either. You're never gonna \"get your money's worth\" out of mercs, priced as they are. Just think of them as kind of bonus ships that make your fleet a bit scarier. Or, hoard them like kuresuti does until you have a significant force of them.\n\nAnd obviously if you have zenith traders you can throw down all sorts of goodies, pause them, and continue building when you have too much cash.\n\nAbout the Zenith Traders... one should always start building 1*players ZPGs before they capture one.\n\nMost useful amongst others is counterspy if you encounter cloaked unlocks. Blackhole machines next on a fortressed world, followed by armour remover and tripler. Orbital Mass Drivers are so-so, and only significant if you lack serious firepower against lead ships (you won't technically need one, say, if you already have a spire city.)"}

{"text": "Raid Starships are good, as are high-level bombers, against the superfortresses as well as the regular fortresses. If you put your starting knowledge into one or the other (I usually go bombers), then that should clear it off for you, but at a pretty high cost. Be prepared to send multiple waves against the superfortress, most likely, and also have other ships on hand to protect your bombers from anything else the AI might send to take them out (since the superfortress itself isn't much good against those bombers).\n\nAlso, you can use a strategy of misdirectng the superfortress around, if you have to, while you destroy the rest of the planet. If you can survive long enough (leading the SF on a wild goose chase if possible), detroying the guard posts and then the command station of the planet will leave that superfortress without the support of any of the other AI ships, thus making it vastly easier to just whittle down with a bunch of bombers, which are hardly hurt by it at all.\n\nDepending on the strength of the rest of the forces at the planet, taking out a superfortress early in the game is definitely possible, but it's costly and tricky. I usually just try to go around those worlds unless there is something worth capturing on them (as is the case in your situation, unfortunately).\n\nCutting down the supply on a super fortress world seems a good idea to neutralize it, but it can be tricky if that world is surrounded by 3 or more worlds. Teleport Stations, Raptors and some other units are pretty good in that purpose."}

{"text": "Magnetize\n\nNemesisDK\n\nhello i really need help with this one, ive been trying to make the magnetize ability affect other ships than fighters, i want to make it into some kind of super weapon that would make half a fleet crash into each other and EXPLODE!! (would look supreme)\n\nYou can make some nice perpetual motion gags with it, but that's it. The impact system only functions with fighters.\n\nYou can fake it, but it will be highly sensitive to system performance. Anyone with a chugging cpu will never see it go off right. Set up two periodics from target ships, one pulling ships from the surrounding area, one setting a kill order on a very small area, close enough that they will be touching when it triggers.\n\nDo a bounce back to the last spawner(ApplyBuffToLastSpawnerNoFilterNoRange) from the kill order and set a delayed explosion there as well. They'll get sucked in, trigger them self destruct, set the target to blow, and poof. Set your delay up right and it should look ok.arhhh!!! is there any way to make the buffs instant... delaytime 0.000000 doesn't seem to cut it... it's like the the entire game engine is running in cycles of seconds... is the any way to make buffs react every 100th of a sec??\n\nplease help, cause the ships bump into eachother like they are supposed to, but some of them doesn't blow till way afterApplyImpulseFromSpawner is another force application like magnetize. It's applying force over time(the definition of impulse when one isn't having an apocalyptic brain fart) so the mass of the object is going to alter how fast it moves. Each ship has it's own mass value.\n\nSee Telekinetic Push for the vanilla implementation of the function, the one that blows away fighters.\n\nThe predictably consistent one is InitializeMovementTowardLastSpawner, BuffRepulsionFieldTarget is an example of this one. All ships will move at the same rate, something you're in dire need of in order to time their explosion.\n\nThe problem with things being delayed using the OnDelay trigger is that you're not accounting for the game design. Each tier triggers independently. Your buff reference inside another buff is triggered at a different time, it has a delayed effect. To have things coincide, they have to be on the same level. For two separate files to enact simultaneously, you would trigger them from the same parent. Getting them to enact at the same time as their parent is simply impossible.\n\nBecause if this, you're always going to have a delay on child actions. So, you have to time it. You have to apply and set off the explosions at the correct ranges to get them to line up, and it's going to be hellishly fun. As soon as you run it on a slower(or faster if yours is inadequate for maximum performance) computer, it's going to be wrong again. There's no good substitution for magnetize with it's impact code.\n\nIf you want an example of buffs with tolerances, download the SOA2 mod and peek at my work. The Jem'Hadar specific buffs on Dominion capital ships, a lot of the Borg abilities, I have lots of interconnected systems that alter or prevent usage entirely. The tolerance is how wide the delay time has to be on things for them to actually interrupt in the appropriate conditions. Too short, and your ships magically receive gifts they weren't supposed to get, mysteriously blow up, switch sides, all kinds of wonderful stuff that isn't intended.\n\nIf I weren't on a stone age computer my curiosity to see it work would have it done already, but alas I can't get something like this to function locally. It was hell just getting fighters to self magnetize for the Borg.\n\nIt has a movement speed, you can weapon effect it as well. Things like the ion blast and whatnot are all travel. Applications without travel are instant, where instant equals when your computer gets around to it.\n\nYou have to use one with travel for bouncing something back off your target because it's the only one there.\n\nIt shouldn't be demanding, it's just that timing doesn't work out real well on say.. a 3.0ghz Pentium 4. There's too much lag in processing actions. If you're applying a buff and blowing a ship up with it in a tenth of a second, it's just not going to happen that fast on lower end machines. They could be blowing half a second late, or missing the application entirely."}

{"text": "Yeah, I think something like that seems reasonable. Only instead of Rebel and Empire, I'd call it light and dark to clarify that it could be 2x Jedi, 2x Rebel, 2x Empire, 2x Sith, and then 1x of something and 1x of something else (just as an example). Having 6 factions is going to make it trickier to keep things balanced.\n\nEach pack of 60 cards wouldn't need to have a perfectly even spread. Remember, each pack of 60 is actually part of a larger cycle of 6 packs that are all connected thematically and mechanically, so think of it more as 360 cards. It's not like having the first pack weigh more heavily for the Imperial Navy will cause some kind of meta game upset, if the next pack is just around the corner.\n\nUnless of course the first pack is a Death Star type Objective card, and the Attack Run event won't release until the end of the cycle\u2026The problem is even if the first cycle is perfectly balanced card wise the meta will screw that up and it will require the next cycle to skew off the \"strongest\" faction. Thankfully it's a \"Living\" game and doesn't have to stagnate on the meta of the day.\n\nWe know that some pods can only be included once per deck, so sometimes there'll need to be a least a few of those singleton pods. Hard to say at this point how common One Per Objective Deck pods will be though, so who knows.\n\nIf they are common, then four pairs of pods and two singleton pods might be standard. If they're less common, five pairs of pods might be the norm with packs including singletons infrequently.Yeah, this could go either way. Even Lord of the Rings LCG is infrequent with this. There was just recently a 'only 1 per deck' card for LotR but they included 3 copies of it in the adventure pack. And yet the Hero cards are also only 1 per deck but we only ever get 1 of each of those.\n\nNever made sense to me.\n\nThey probably did it incase you wanted to run Path of Need in multiple decks, but what are the odds of wanting/needing to do that? Probably about the same odds as me wanting to run the same hero in multiple decks. Or any other card x3 in multiple decks.\n\nLotr heroes aren't one per deck, they're one per game. The other unique cards come in triplicate so you can get to them faster in your deck, but heroes start in play, so you dont need ti fish for them. Plus it gives them an extra two cards for the encounter set. My money is on them doing 2 copies each of all pods, even if they are limited, because it means there's less pods to design and balance.\n\nBut that's my point. Normal cards are 3x per deck and thus 3x per game for ME. Of course, if I like having multiple decks together at the same time with the same cards or if I want Path of Need in MY deck and also in my friend's deck, that's my prerogative. But these optional choices shouldn't be FFG's concern. FFG should supply a person with the max number of each card for one deck and use the extra space for whatever else, something cool. Giving me 3x Path of Need or 2x of a Star Wars pod that are one per deck doesn't help me any more than giving me 3x of a hero. It wastes space for something else worthwhile/cool."}

{"text": "Dieing\" of WH-Space\n\nOkay, here's the situation:\n\nOne of our alliance corps have set up a POS in a WH-space. One of their members claims to know that WH spaces start \"dieing\", when POSes are set up in it, meaning the rate of sig-spawning decreases over time. He can't provide any evidence off the internet, he only bases his theory on his observation. He persists on his opinion, that before they set up their POS they had \"at least 20 sigs anytime\", while now they're \"lucky when we get 5 sigs a day\".\n\nRe: \"Dieing\" of WH-Space\n\nIIRC the harder a system is farmed in general the fewer sigs respawn in a WH. The POS is just an assisting factor and people who have a POS in system would rationally spend more time in that WH farming the sigs.\n\nRe: \"Dieing\" of WH-Space\n\nBeen said before, saw some discussions on that topic on eve-o (I think) a year ago. Unless things changed recently, it's not true.\nThen again, most people tend to not look at their own system wrt farming W-space, but are interested in (and depend on) their static destination for farming.\n\nRe: \"Dieing\" of WH-Space\n\nIt works the same as anomalies.\nIf you go to a deserted system you will often find a lot of signature, and i mean a lot, however you're not likely to find them in highly traveled systems.\nWhen you farm a WH you start doing the signatures on the system and said signatures start spawning in less populated WH's.\nIn short, setting up a POS on a system doesnt decrease the appearance of signatures, you being there and farming everyday does.\nDO what you're supposed to do: Jump to adjacent systems and do the signatures there\n\nRe: \"Dieing\" of WH-Space\n\nInitiating (or landing, there isn't any good way to test a difference) warp to a signature does indeed force that signature into existence. From that point, it will begin its normal set of completion triggers, such as site completed (via killing a certain npc/object), warping out (certain DED sites do this), or time expired. POS has no impact whatsoever on the sites you find in a system, but your presence will. By completing sites, they will go and respawn elsewhere. Over time, sites will naturally accumulate in systems that nobody goes to, as opposed to where everybody is constantly scanning. Non-activated sites last considerably longer that activated sites, so an empty system will build up a reservoir of them.\n\nAt any rate, you chose the wormhole for its statics, not the sites there on your move-in day. Think of those as a homecoming present, not the reason to set up the pos.\n\nRe: \"Dieing\" of WH-Space\n\nAs has already been said, POS in system has no effect on spawn rate for new sigs.\n\nAnother option to the \"farm your static!\" stuff that has already been mentioned is just living in a c6. Due to the high activity rate there and relatively few number of C6 systems, the local spawn rate there is quite good. We usually have been 3 and 5 anoms actively being worked each day, with occasional spikes up to 9 or 10 when particularly lucky."}

{"text": "First, nothing is ever easy in interstellar trade. You've got to find commodities that are worth the trip, get them to a different planet, and then convince the locals to give you other worthwhile commodities or local currency rather than simply killing you and taking your stuff. If your target market is a reasonably civilized world with mature markets, there's relatively little danger. Which is why everyone else in the sector is already there, trading ahead of you and driving down profits.\n\nEven assuming you can get the stuff there and get it sold, you have to take your pay in local credits or commodities. In a default game of Stars Without Number, currency differences are glossed over because they're not terribly important. If PCs intend to make trading a serious part of their game, however, it becomes much, much more important. Credits from Gateway are almost worthless on Polychrome, because the locals of Polychrome have no way to translate Gateway money into usable goods or services. Instead, a Gateway trader brings in a load of spike drive components and trades them out for Polychrome cyberware, which he brings back to Gateway and converts into a new load of drive components and a local profit which he plows back into goods and services on Gateway.\n\nMoney in a trade campaign is specific to each world. You can usually convert small amounts of credit to and from other currencies on worlds with active interstellar trade, as collateralized claims exist to support modest amounts of exchange, but you're not going to be able to haul a million credits of Polychrome currency over to Gateway and buy yourself a new merchant frigate.\n\nBut let's assume the players want to go through this after all, and are willing to put up with the difficulties of the enterprise.

Most planets already have their own supplies of these goods, but by carefully choosing variants that they don't possess or are short on, the captain of a trade ship can expect to be able to sell these on most planets.\n\n1 ton of risky goods costs 5,000 credits. These are unique planetary specialties, exotic rare earths, cyberware, local art, or other niche goods that may or may not have a market on any other world. Getting these sold requires either excellent market scouting or a great deal of wheeling and dealing on the ground in order to find the right buyers.\n\n1 ton of treasure can't be purchased reasonably, but is worth 10,000 credits. Treasure is fabulously valuable stuff that can find a buyer anywhere- usually pretech gear and components, construction nanites, pretech medical supplies, or anything else that has almost universal applicability and desirability. If the PCs want treasure, they've got to go find treasure, and that means adventuring to get their hands on the stuff.\n\nOnce the PCs have spent their local credits, they can haul the cargo to whatever planet they think will make a good market for it. Once it comes time to sell, let them roll their Business skill, modified by Int or Charisma. Apply the following modifiers to their roll.\n\n-2 for selling risky goods. -4 for selling on an anarchic hellhole with no real law. -2 for selling on a world without a secure rule of law. -1 for selling on a world where they've angered some important local.\n\n+2 for selling safe goods. +1 for selling on a world where they've made a powerful local friend. +2 f or selling on a law-abiding and civilized world.\n\nOn a roll of 2 or less, they've managed to get the locals bent on stealing the cargo and their ship, either through brute force or through legal shenanigans. Pick a local grandee or government official; that NPC is going to do everything in his or her power to seize the cargo and the PCs' ship, though a particularly large favor performed might get the ship released.\n\nOn a roll of 3-6, they can only sell the goods for half their purchase price, unless they perform some favor for a local buyer. Maybe he needs help before he can afford to pay decent prices, or maybe he only needs the goods if a certain difficulty is solved for him. If the PCs work something out, they make 1d4+2 * 10% profit on the sale.\n\nOn a roll of 7-9, they manage to move the goods with minimum fuss, and make 1d4+2 * 10% profit on the deal.\n\nOn a roll of 10-12, they can sell the goods for 1d4+2 * 10% profit, but there's a special buyer who's willing to give them twice that percentage if they can do them a little favor.\n\nOn a roll of 13+, they find a desperately enthusiastic buyer, and can sell the goods at 100% profit.\n\nMarkets are subject to flooding. There are only so many tons of anything that a world needs to buy in a given timeframe. You should feel free to cap the maximum number of tons of goods that PCs can sell on any given world in a month. A full merchant frigate's cargo hold is usually a good limit; the massive cargo freighters that still exist only make economic sense on limited high-volume runs between major powers.\n\nThe above little system isn't enough to hang an entire trade campaign on it, but it should be enough to suffice for those PCs who want to make occasional trade runs. Letting the PCs earn large amounts of credits isn't really a balance problem in SWN, because there's not anything unbalancing they can actually buy with their money, unless the GM intentionally allows them to invest in pretech artifacts or major warships. Cash most often serves as simply a tool for accomplishing the goals that the PCs have set themselves, and a GM should feel free to just sit back and let them use their wealth accordingly- taking into account, of course, the myriad troubles that tend to accumulate around those who are both wealthy and subject to squeezing by other powers."}

{"text": "Messages - Joseph Hewitt\n\nI considered something like this before, but didn't do anything with the idea. Conversations could be built on the fly. When a regular conversation is entered, the game puts together a list of all the things the NPC might have to say- this could include permanent features of the NPC (such as a shopkeeper's shop), plot-related stuff (such as a mission offer), stuff related to other plots (if a mission requires you to round up three other pilots, this option would appear for any pilots you meet), stuff related to local events (such as asking info about the mecha bandits), or even general knowledge stuff (who are the Silver Knights?).\n\nOnce all the options are there, the game can select a greeting from the list of possible greetings that'll lead to each of the available paths. This will require having some kind of descriptive context for each of the \"destinations\", but that can be worked out. Returning to the \"base state\" will be handled just like the greeting, except that the message will be \"Is there anything else you want to ask?\" or whatnot.\n\nNot all nodes need be enterable from the base state- maybe, every state will generate its own destinations, not just the first one.\n\nIf an NPC initiates conversation, the code for that could start the conversation at a specific point rather than doing a greeting. This would be important for such things as combat challenges.\n\nMaybe some nodes could be marked as optional: In a given combat challenge, there's an optional surrender node where the NPC runs away, but this will only get added to the conversation if it somehow makes sense.\n\nThe big issue I see in implementing this in Python is that there's a huge number of functions that need to be embedded in the structure. You could do this by making \"exchange\" a class and the functions its methods, but then almost every instance would need to be a new subclass. Which is not a problem per se, of course, but I'm wondering how to structure things so that the code for a conversation is relatively easy to write and comprehend.\n\nI've taken a look through Ren'Py, and what they've done is to add a scripting layer on top of Python which handles the messy bits. Their situation isn't exactly the same as GearHead's, though- the \"conversations\" there are actually the execution flow of the program, and they don't need to be serialized since there's no random element to their structure.\n\nI've started writing a conversation module for use in the random story generation test program.\n\nPlots The GearHead world is dynamic- things change, new events and missions come up all the time. These events are handled with Plots. A Plot is basically a collection of scripts and locations that get added to the world temporarily, then when they're finished get taken away again. Just as the gear is the basis for all physical objects, the plot is the basis for all narrative content. Typically a plot represents a single beat in a larger story. Plots have the following characteristics:\n\nA plot can request elements, which are things from the game world which are needed to carry out the plot. Characters. A character may be involved in only one plotline at a time. Scenes. Factions. Items. A plot can request child plots. A child will either be part of the same plotline, or the beginning of a new plotline. The tree formed is called a Story; see below for more details. A plot may create new characters or items, or may optionally have these things created automatically if an element search fails. Upon initialization, a plot may move any of its elements within the game world. When the plot terminates the element will be moved back to its original home. A plot has a scope, which may be global (encompassing the entire adventure) or local (encompassing a single city and its subscenes, or even a single scene) Within the plot's scope, the plot can have scripts for all of the normal triggers (team movement, time steps, entering or leaving a scene, etc). A plot can define personas for any character it has as an element. A plot can define temporary scenes. When the plot terminates, these scenes are also deleted and any contents are returned to their original scenes. A plot can have both subplots A plot can be active or inactive. Only one plot of a given plotline can be active at once.\n\nStory A story is a tree of interconnected plotlines. When created, the root plot is activated and is thereafter responsible for activating its children. Only one plot of a given plotline can be active at once, so if a plot activates a child which is within the same plotline it will be deactivated itself. A plot which is deactivated gets removed from the game. Any active child plots it has are moved to root. Any inactive child plots it has are eliminated. Temporary scenes and other resources it has are cleaned up.\n\nHere is an example of a simple mecha combat mission:\n\nThere are two plotlines. The mission offer is activated first; this plot has a mission-giving NPC as an element. If the PC talks to the NPC, and accepts the mission, the combat subplot is activated. Once the combat is completed (either through a win, loss, or timeout) the Mission Offer plot will activate either the Victory or Loss subplots, as appropriate. As these are part of the same (red) plotline, the Mission Offer plot will then be eliminated.\n\nIf the mission-giving NPC dies the red plotline may be terminated immediately. If this happens before Combat is activated, then that plotline just gets disposed of. If it happens after Combat is activated, the PC will still be able to go and fight the combat, but there will be no-one to give a reward afterward.\n\nFrom what you describe in your earlier post, all the things that are relevant to context are already available from the Gear object itself, so I don't think it makes sense for Gears to have string attributes encoding this same information. But you may be right that it makes sense to have a special way to specify requests.\n\nYou're right; looking over my post, I think I explained that part poorly. In Pascal GH, context requests are stored as strings, while gear contexts are generated from the gear's characteristics as they're needed. There's no need to store them as strings within a gear, and in fact that would be a very bad thing since a gear's context can change very often depending on its state.\n\nQuote\n\nThat said, my inclination would be to keep the context stuff as simple as possible until the simple scheme gets too cumbersome. Hard to get simpler than if statements, and it's not hard to write if statements that can handle weighted preferences.\n\nI'd be inclined to say, let's put together a random-plot builder and ultra-simple Adventure-style game that lets players walk through it. GearHead, after all, is that plus a giant-robot-fighting system that you have to get through to get to the next plot nodes. So if whatever scheme works in this simple context, it's probably fine.\n\nOK.\n\nQuote\n\nDoes it maybe make sense to develop such a thing on github, so that folks here can test out our own ideas against the game skeleton?\n\nThat's a great idea. I built a similar program when prototyping the GH2 plot system, but made the mistake of not making it interactive- the first plots all looked fine as stories but were far too linear/rigid when played as a game.\n\nI've been playing around with a plot tester myself. My idea was that there'd be just a text console and a menu- or, a menu in the text console. No need to make a fancy UI. The game contains a simple world made up of three types: scenes (which act as containers for everything else), characters, and props (which model everything else).\n\nUsing the menu you can either move to a connected scene or interact with any character or prop in the same scene. Characters and props are pretty much the same thing, aside from having different contexts- you select their menu entry and they do something.\n\nI will try to do a complete writeup of the plot system this afternoon, but basically: Plots are temporary additions to an adventure. Plots may request \"elements\"- characters, props, or scenes which are searched for and then associated with this plot. A character or prop associated with a plot will have its normal behavior redefined by the plot. Plots may spawn additional plots, resulting in plot branching.\n\nPersonally I think that context matching is such a common and important thing in GH that it's okay to have a special system to describe it, despite the learning curve. Of course writing the criteria as Python code is more powerful\n\nOne problem with doing context matching as an \"if ...and...and...and\" statement is that the context matcher should return a weighted value rather than a simple yes or no. I know this doesn't make the \"if...\" form impossible, but if we decide later to change the weighting scheme it does mean that everything needs to be individually altered.\n\nI'm not sure how somethings like alignment and faction would be apropriate for eg. scene gears. Maybe 'creatures' or 'entities' would be an appropriate sub-category under which these things fall?\n\nCities typically belong to a government faction, and buildings can belong to factions as well- bases, factories, and so forth.\n\nQuote\n\nOoh shiny. What is a development event? Something like a barrier before the next \"phase\" of a plot?\n\nIt's one of the special plots that involves a lancemate- for instance, the one where a junior LM asks the PC for advice, or the one where the LM finds a mission for the PC, or the one where a villainous LM's past enemies show up to enact revenge.\n\nGenerally these plots will advance the LM's personal story (as modeled by attitude, motivation, and personality traits) and provide the LM with a new talent or skill. They only occur once every 15 to 20 renown bumps, in order to more evenly distribute the events in time/among lancemates.\n\nQuote\n\nQuick thought: Perhaps this can be generalized into a real-valued weight score? Along with must and must-not haves: good to have \u2192 +1, bad to have \u2192 -1. Some plots trigger at certain renown levels, right? Handling renown as part of the weight score could make them more or less likely to trigger at higher renown. (thinking of it though, perhaps that's better done with a bell-curve-like probability match + a single renown value for the plot that represents both the point of highest probability of getting loaded and the average reward scaler to limit renown-explosion)\n\nThe context match score in GH2 is calculated multiplicatively- IIRC, every match doubles the weight.\n\nA plot request includes a renown rating. There are five context tags corresponding to five renown levels: Green, Regular, Veteran, Elite, and Ace. These can be factored into the plot requirements like other context tags- a rat killing mission might require Green level, for instance, while a major assault might only occur at Veteran or above.\n\nCurrently the renown level for plots is based on the PC's renown, while the renown rating for quests is set when the adventure is generated. One example of this is in the mecha arenas, where different NPCs only show up at specific renown levels. Tama, for instance, is always either a Green or a Regular pilot. Vanda, on the other hand, will always be either Elite or Ace.\n\nEdit- I just realized I left out one very important thing from the context documentation: it's possible to include an \"or-list\", a list of items for which one thing must be true. For instance, a plot might request renown level Green or Regular.\n\nI don't remember who did the sprite, but you're right it doesn't match the monster. If you could make a lovecraftian monstrosity sprite that'd be great; otherwise, I guess the monster itself could be altered to fit the sprite.\n\nSecond: define the custom methods inside the plot subclass (as static methods). Let the plot's initiation code create the Computer and fill its trigger function variables with references to those static methods of the plot class. In serial format, the Computer instance contains the typename/unique identifier of the plot class that contains the custom functions, each function's name, and the action that triggers each of those functions. It wouldn't matter if there is more than one instance of a plot running, since the special functions are static methods, and state information are all contained in the specific instances of plot and Computer.\n\nI think this is the better solution- after all, we want to make it easier for people to add content, and splitting things up between files would be a pain (not to mention a maintenance nightmare).\n\nAre there any UI extensions for PyGame? That might be a good thing to look for, especially if it also included text entry boxes and other knick-knacks. Then again, maybe the game could be written with a widget toolkit like GTK or whatever the one that comes with Python by default is called. It's not like we're using high-end graphics here.\n\n...\n\nI typed up the context system at the GearHead Prime design doc. Here's a copy of that:\n\nContext Every gear has a list of attributes which may be relevant for content selection; these attributes are the gear's context. These tags include the following information:\n\nThe existence or nonexistence of the gear in question. The gear's faction, or lack thereof. Also, whether the gear belongs to the same faction as the PC or not. The gear's alignment with regards to the PC: enemy, ally, or neutral. The type of the gear: scene, character, monster, item, faction... For NPCs, there are additional attributes: The job type of the NPC: Adventurer, Academic, Corporate, etc. The NPC's attitude and motivation. The NPC's personality traits: Extraverted or Intraverted, Cheerful or Grim, Aggressive or Passive. The NPC's governing virtue: Justice, Peace, Fellowship, Duty, or Glory. The NPC's personal relationship with the PC: friend, lancemate, or nemesis. Whether the NPC is a Major or Minor NPC. Whether the NPC is Ready to be featured in a plot. Whether the NPC is currently a member of the PC's lance. Whether a lancemate NPC is ready for a development event. For Factions, there are additional attributes: The faction's type: Corporate, Military, Criminal, etc... The faction's governing virtues. For Scenes, there are additional attributes: The scene's type: City, Building, Dungeon, etc... The scene's environment: Mountains, Forest, Wasteland, Deep Space, etc... The scene's terrain: Space, Ground, or Underwater. The scene's world: Earth, L5, L4, Luna, Mars...\n\nTo generate content, it will usually be necessary to examine the context of several gears at once. For instance, to generate a new subplot we need to examine the context of the city where the plot will take place, the PC's faction, any characters or factions involved in the parent plot... to keep everything straight each context attribute should be connected to an identifier telling which gear it belongs to. In classic GH this was handled by making the identifiers single chars and the attributes five char strings, separated by a colon. So the context \"P:L5LAW P:POLIC P:PCFAC P:ALLY_ P:++ E:REDMA E:CRIME E:++ E:ENEMY\" would tell us about the PC's faction (P) and the enemy faction (E). In new GH, it doesn't really matter how this is implemented as long as the functionality remains. It would probably be best to make the identifiers more readable.\n\nContext Search Often we will need to check the context to make sure it matches some condition we've set. For instance, a certain plot might only load while the player is on Earth, or if the enemy faction is Criminal. When we have a list of options to choose from, not all of them are given equal weight. The more context tags that match the more likely a plot is to be chosen. This is because a context search with a lot of tags is much more specific than one with few tags, and so the situation is likely to come up less often. There are three options for each attribute in the context search:\n\nMust Have: This tag must exist in the target context, or the search fails. Must Not Have: This tag must not exist in the target context, or the search fails. Good to Have: If this tag exists in the target context, the likelihood of selecting this content is increased. If this tag doesn't exist there is no effect.\n\nFor instance, a plot which requires \"S:EARTH ~S:FEDER -S:IPSHIL\" could only occur on Earth (Must Have), is more likely to happen within the Federation (Good to Have), but will never happen in Ipshil (Must Not Have).\n\nImagine that a plot requires a door which doesn't open when used- instead it starts a conversation with the NPC behind the door, but then after talking the NPC unlocks the door and it functions normally from that point on. Or suppose it has a combination or puzzle lock. Or suppose a NPC has sent the PC to open a stuck door, and the PC can try a number of different tactics- use repair on it, beat it down, etc. These things would be very hard to generalize. Even worse, consider a computer terminal- in GH1 and GH2 just about every computer terminal has its own unique behavior, and this behavior only makes sense in the context of the plot/scene/whatever that spawned it.\n\nI'll post a more thorough description of the context tags tomorrow. I'm not sure that anything I post tonight would make sense.\n\nSilly nitpick: ooh, one module indented with tabs, and one with spaces. Equality for all? Personally I root for the tab indent side. I hope it wins.\n\nOops, I thought I had them both converted to spaces now... I'll fix that.\n\nQuote\n\nSome logic revolves around Gear.max_HP being positive, negative or zero. ... The gears.py code could be simplified a little by replacing a few for-loops with more 'pythonic' alternatives.\n\nYou're right. I was pretty much running on automatic there, translating from Pascal to Python. That shouldn't be hard to change.\n\nQuote\n\n(as much as I'm a curses fan) Wait, whut? So this is not for GH Prime? Cause weren't we going to abandon the idea of a text mode interface for GH Prime? I actually put some tileset code in my github to do (among others) something vaguely similiar to ToME's \"ASCII\" implementation.\n\nIt's just for trying stuff out now at the beginning, not for the final game.\n\nQuote\n\nWasn't it a bit of a problem last time the interface of GH SDL version (which I think most users use) got constrained because of the way the curses code is written?\n\nNot that I remember... the main issue with the ASCII interface was elevation levels, if I remember correctly.\n\nQuote\n\nWell, when it comes to an engine written in something like Python, significantly blurring the lines between scripting and the engine is a very viable way to do it.\n\nYes. I just want to know exactly what shape this is going to take. Let me get into some specific examples...\n\n- There should be a list of content. When new content (a plot) is to be added to the game world, an appropriate choice is selected and matched to the adventure. My first thought was to make each plot a subclass of the basic plot type and then instantiate it to add it to the world. Problem #1: Plot insertion often fails, if the plot can't allocate the resources (characters, scenes) it needs. Instantiation doesn't normally fail. Problem #2: Plots can contain their own content, such as the proverbial customized door. If this content gets defined as a class (inheriting from some other class) then it can't be properly contained by the plot class or else it won't be properly serializable. I guess this isn't that great a problem, but it is kind of ugly.\n\n- A common task of the story generator is to search for things based on context. In GH:Pascal, the context is a string containing lots of descriptions. Each description is of the form [gear identifier]:[context tag], where \"gear identifier\" somehow identifies the thing this context belongs to and \"context tag\" tells us something about it. For instance, \"@:ADVEN\" would tell the story generator that the part currently being examined is an adventurer. Instead of using strings for context lists, in Python it would make sense to use a set. However, how to construct the individual context descriptions? They could be strings, as in GH:Pascal, but this seems inelegant and it is definitely prone to errors.\n\nI put together the start of a Gears module in Python, and Peridot went ahead and improved/expanded it. I've also translated the GH menus to Python with Curses; this must be the fourth or fifth language rpgmenus has been translated into (AMOS, PCQ Pascal, some kind of Amiga BASIC, FreePascal... I think there have been others). Both files have been attached. Let me know what you think.\n\nThe thing I'm worried about, though, is scripting. The two things that REALLY worry me are 1) I don't yet know how it's going to work, and 2) I don't know if adding content is going to be any easier than with GHLua.\n\nSo, my next Python project will be to create a random plot/scripting system. Before I have a game for it. Because that makes perfect sense.\n\nI'll be sticking to the GearHead specifications (which means that I first have to fully define those specifications), so with any luck it should be easy to just drop these modules into the game with little modification.\n\nThe test program will have three types of objects: scenes, characters, and props. Using the menu system you will be able to navigate through the scenes and interact with the characters/props, just like the world's most primitive visual novel (without visuals). After the world is generated additional Plots can be loaded; these alter the behavior of scenes, characters, and props currently in the world, or may add additional ones to the world.\n\nI've locked registration following a spam explosion.

For example, in the anime series Legend of the Galactic Heroes, there was some funky gas stuff that exploded very violently if lasers or guns were shot through it. Sort of like the laser vs. shields thing in the Dune universe. This forced armies to duke it out in fancy armor, crossbows and giant battleaxes. The rest of the show was about giant space battles where the ships lined up like 18th century European line infantry and space politics.\n\nBut they got to add in some really cool face to face melee combat scenes because of some magical gas that they made up.\n\na good way to force action sequences or whatever is to make up magical- er I mean fictional chemicals or elements that have some oddly specific behaviors.\n\nThat's the cool thing about speculative fiction. You propose some sort of technobabble and explore the societal and practical ramifications. For instance, if this gas explodes violently then can it not also be harvested as a powerful fuel? Simply store it in gas canisters and spray little bits at a time into a laser lit engine. Or store it at very high concentration and then light a laser inside the canister as a bomb.\n\nYes I watched Legend of Galactic Heroes, i dont know if they used the Zephyr (I think) for propulsion purposes as well.\n(Otherwise I disliked that series, Yang always knew what the enemy is planning, they launch a small attack, Send there our whole navy! Yeah why not, next time, they launch a very big attack, and of course it is only a decoy...)\n\nBasically, in deep space, where arent civilans and neutral parties, AIs cant do much wrong...\nIn case of orbital patrol, human decision is needed, and i doubt that remote control is always enough, there can be spys for example, that can hack the system to create an international scandal or something like that.\nAlso you have more options to rescue pilots.\n\nI had the idea, that aliens can deploy self-replicating nanobots to Earth, to infect computers, turn our own robots and infrastructure against us...\nThey want everything to be ready, by the time they arrive.\n\nHowever, if their plan A fails, they can launch a relativistic torpedo against Earth...\nHowever, if their plan A fails, they can launch a relativistic torpedo against Earth...Without magic technobabble like a forcefield not really. The most you could do is fill your system with highly sophisticated gravity sensors to sense the RKV as it comes. You might not have much time at all because if it is travelling at 0.9c (which btw is roughly the velocity an object needs to reach for its kinetic energy to reach half its rest mass) and you detect it at one light day out this means it is only two light hours away. If you do have time you could try to divert its path with powerful lasers or try to through mass in the way to deflect it but I doubt you could really do any of that.\n\nCharles Stross dealt with this issue in his novel Iron Sunrise. In it various factions have STL-deterrents hidden in their Oort cloud operating under a dead-man switch. If they don't receive a signal every X hours they launch towards a target planet (trying to find a tiny ship, possibly stealthed from across a system would be next to impossible). This largely stopped factions invading each other for fear of severe retaliation years later.\n\nIf a RKV hits a one kilogram mass before the planet, what would happen to it?\nThe energy of the collision could turn it into a dissolving plasma cloud or dont?\n\nAt around 0.87c the kinetic energy of an object exceeds half it's rest mass. So a one kilogram RKV travelling at 0.87c relative to the planet will have the kinetic energy of e=0.5*c2 = 4.5 petajoules = ~10 megatonnes of TNT (~600 Hiroshima bombs). At that speed it would get through the atmosphere in less than a millisecond and cause massive devastation to the area it hit (akin to a nuclear explosion plus an earthquake). Some quick googling tells me that the meteorite that killed the dinosaurs released ~0.5 Yottajoules of energy which would be the equivalent of a 5 kilotonne RKV travelling at 0.87 which works out to be roughly the mass of 50m x 10m x 10m of ice.\n\nThis is something that a lot of SF authors forget in their haste to write about relativistic ships the size of super-carriers and cities. The very ships you have littered in your setting as though they were sprinkles on a cake could all be converted to weapons thousands of times more powerful than the meteorite that caused the K-T mass extinction! (this is also known as Jon's law or the Kzinti lesson)\n\nI can see, but if you try to put a brick in the way of the RKV well before it hits the planet?\nWould that mean, that only the brick disintegrates in the collision, or the RKV also?\n\nWhatever you put in front of an object travelling that fast would just be disintegrated, like a wet tissue paper thrown in front of an artillery shell. It may slow the RKV down a negligible amount but what you really hope or is to divert its course ever so slightly so that it misses its target. More likely though is that it may cause the RKV to break up but even if it did it wouldn't change the amount of energy that is about to hit: whether it hits the planet in 1 piece or 1 million pieces the same horrendous amount of energy is about to be released.\n\nmy problem with relativistic weapons is how the heck do you aim them properlythis may be a misunderstanding on my part, but wouldn't it take a looot of energy to change the course of something moving extremely fast?"}

If I want a faction of oppressive shady individuals leading unwitting pawns and suppressing the truth, I will start an Inquisition force. Leave the Tau to the people who want to be the genuine 'good guys' in a setting I say.\n\nAssuming that they do so at all, since the only real evidence of it is just short of fan fiction. (an alternate ending to a 3rd party produced video game).Re: Why haven't the Tau had to deal with Chaos on any of their planets more often?\n\nOriginally Posted by TheDungen\n\nIts also possible that its like with the channellers in wheel of time, while some extremely few may be born with the ability a much greater number have the ability to learn to be psykers. The imperium needs psykers so they find theese and train them. the tau dont so they only ever meet the naturally occurring psykers.\n\nnot knowing that you're a psyker seems to be a good defence mechanic aswell.\n\nAs stated, you can't \"learn\" to be a psyker, you're either born one, or you're not.\n\nSecondly, not knowing you're a psyker is actually incredibly dangerous, because it essentially turns you into a ticking time bomb, waiting for the time when your powers finally manifest, usually in a moment of extreme stress, and usually results in massive problems (pyrokines/telekines creating a massive explosion, telepaths shredding the minds of everyone close-by, etc, let alone the damage caused if they opened a warp breach/got possessed). There's a reason the Imperium is so strict in the detection of psykers, and it's not just because they want to send them to the EmperorOriginally Posted by Kakapo42Unless the Ethereals are incredibly foolish and short-sighted, it would not have been unintended.\n\nRe: Why haven't the Tau had to deal with Chaos on any of their planets more often?also have we ever been told how biologically psychic powers work, if its a genetic trait or so on. Considering that we probably haven't then its really open to interpretation.\n\nRe: Why haven't the Tau had to deal with Chaos on any of their planets more often?\n\nOriginally Posted by TheDungenNo, again, it's not something you learn. You don't start off as a weak psyker, and then improve your way to Alpha Level through training. If you're an Alpha-psyker, you're born as an Alpha-psyker, you just haven't manifested your powers yet. Psykers can learn to control their powers more thoroughly, or how to safely draw deeper from the Warp, but not how to move from Delta up to Alpha. A psyker first learning they're psychic unintentionally is an incredibly dangerous thing for that reason. A pyrokine doesn't learn he's that by forming a candle-size flame on the tip of his finger, he does it by immolating the supervisor who was berating him for taking time off work to care for his sick wife, or by burning down the hab block when he has a nightmare. If he's very, very unlucky, he does it by having the nightmares in his head tearing a hole open inside his brain, and using the portal to wreak havoc in the material world. \"The records of the Witch Hunters detail many instances which serve to caution any who underestimate the danger posed by a nascent psyker: storms of energy kilometres across, psychic shock waves strong enough to shatter plasteel and towering infernos of power are but a few of the details recorded by servants of the Ordo Hereticus\".\n\nWe're also told that untrained psykers are beacons for daemons, because they have no idea how to protect themselves. They don't know what daemons are, they don't know what they are themselves. To them, they're just particularly vivid nightmares, or a whispering at the edge of hearing. There are a great many instances of a daemonic incursion starting from a daemon possessing an untrained psyker. This is why the location of psykers is so important for the Imperium. If it were as laid-back as you describe, they wouldn't have to bother hunting for them, as when they manifest their powers, they'll do crud-all, and then word will spread. The truth is far more risky. Most develop their powers \"safely\" at adolescence, but there's the chance of them staying latent until later, when a moment of stress causes them to unleash their potential, or the risk of it happening earlier. Being a psyker is not a good thing in 40k. It's a curse, not a blessingRe: Why haven't the Tau had to deal with Chaos on any of their planets more often?\n\nOriginally Posted by TheDungenTwo things. Firstly, game rules do not equal fluff. Inquisitor also had Marines doing more damage if they threw their bolt pistol rather than firing it. Secondly, absence of evidence isn't evidence of absence. We've been given absolutely no information about the rate of psykers appearing in Tau-held areas, so to assume that it's less than Imperials is wrong. We have no GW sources telling us that humans have raised psykers in Tau-held space, therefore we have no GW sources telling us that humans have raised psykers in Tau-held spaceI don't see how that's relevant in any way whatsoever. The fact remains that we've been told absolutely nothing about the Tau and their dealings with human psykers, so to assume that it's any different from anywhere else is just an assumption. There's no evidence for it, and no reason for why it should be truePerhaps the Tau's pheromone control dulls emotions to the point where using psychic powers becomes very difficult for low power psykers, and given the small size of the empire they haven't had any truly powerful psykers.\n\nRe: Why haven't the Tau had to deal with Chaos on any of their planets more often?\n\nI understood it this way: That the Tau do not have a warp presence and as such don't really have psykers. It could have something to do with the fact that the Tau, as a race are only about ten thousand years old. They are only at such an advanced societal and technological level because of the warp storms surrounding their planet for 6,000 years. While I don't think there's any canon that says warp storms ever do that, it is implied in the fluff. I think it has also said somewhere that no Tau has ever fallen to Chaos. This makes sense, because they must understand Chaos on a basic level, and the Greater Good demands they seek prosperity and success.\n\nRe: Why haven't the Tau had to deal with Chaos on any of their planets more often?\n\nWell, one reason could be that despite the Controll of the Tau over the local populance they allow them a broad margin of self-government. You have to work (and die) for the greater good and accept that the tau are the noble overlords of yours but how you achive it is up to the local bodies of government. And so you still have witch-trials/burnings which have been ingrained into the local customs over millenia and the tau don't swat an eye. Because they know, as long as we allow them to burn and kill a few weirdos every year they keep quiet and do what they are told.\ntau: \"Why do you want to kill that man?\"\nformerly imperial citizen. \"He's a witch! He shows the three known signs! If we don't kill him, the world will end! It is known!\"\ntau - looking at the agitated mob armed with electro-pitchforks and torches - \"Well then. Carry on!\" Walks away muttering to himself \"Those poor backward souls, but what are you gonna do about it? Keeps 'em happy.\"\n\nRe: Why haven't the Tau had to deal with Chaos on any of their planets more often?\n\nOriginally Posted by ryng_sting\n\nI don't think it's impossible that Chaos could corrupt a Tau. But due their position, weak warp presence, culture, lack of psykers - and the overwhelming fact that there's easier pickings elsewhere - it's probably that, for now, Chaos can't be bothered with them.\n\nIndeed. Chaos can corrupt inanimate objects, so they can certainly corrupt Tau. However why would a daemon go for the dry Tau crackers when he can also have a nice Human Big Mac (or, for that matter, a delectable Eldar steak)? Not to mention that the galaxy is absolutely filled to the brim with Big Macs, while the dry crackers are in rather short supply. Daemon do not need to watch their weight, after all.\n\nI like Corvussanctus's idea, I could see that work (they haven't completely stopped the Kroot from eating their enemies, after all, so even if the Tau find something rather gruesome they're not going to stop you if you join in for the Greater Good). I could also imagine that it in fact has gone wrong a few times, but that the Tau interpreted the whole thing as a simple human uprising and just killed the offenders when they couldn't be reasoned with. Apart from that, in-universe, the Tau as a race have simply been absurdly lucky so far.\n\nLast edited by Crazy Ivan; 19-08-2012 at 22:16.\nReason: spelling\n\nWhen in deadly danger\nWhen beset by doubt\nRun in little circles\nWave your arms and shout\n\nRe: Why haven't the Tau had to deal with Chaos on any of their planets more often?\n\nThere is probable no 1 major reason why the tau haven't had to deal so much with chaos it more a combination of things, 1) tau have little or no warp signature, 2) they only have a small empire on the scale of things. 3) the Tau-va mentality generally is an infertile ground for chaos. 4) we also for get one thing the tau have is the Technology. i wouldn't be surprised if they made implants so human psykers could suppress there powers. remember this is the race that out adapted the Nids\n\nRe: Why haven't the Tau had to deal with Chaos on any of their planets more often?\n\nI think people are forgetting that Imperial worlds have the Black Ships that weed out most psychers, and they also have the Imperial Creed that encourage humans to turn on anyone they fear is a psycher.\n\nHuman communities in Tau space (some which seem to be quite large in the Third Sphere of the Tau Empire, more like human worlds in the Tau Empire), would have to deal with the threat of untrained psychers without the aid of the Black Ships. Seeing from how the Tau allow other races to keep their culture, The Imperial Truth could remain more or less as it is (with less focus on 'Kill the alien!' maybe), but the Tau seem to try and have a civilising influence on the natives (meaning they would most likely try to encourage humans not to kill each other. Unity and the Greater Good and all that), meaning human communities would be even less able to protect themselves from daemonic and warp-based catastrophes because of the Tau mentality.\n\nIt doesn't matter if the Tau are wholly immune to possession, they have a lot of humans living under their roof now, and those humans are certainly not immune. The Tau presence also takes away most of the defences the humans have from chaos, meaning the problem of possession and daemonic attacks should be much greater on Tau-held human worlds than on Imperial worlds.\n\nRe: Why haven't the Tau had to deal with Chaos on any of their planets more often?\n\nThe Black Ships can pick up maybe a dozen individuals from an entire world during a single trip. The number of psykers in Tau space would be somewhere in the tens of thousands, and most of them fairly weak, assuming the rate at which Alpha level psykers are the same as the rest of the species. This is a very easily contained number on the greater scale.\n\nFurthermore, the Tau have been fighting the Imperium for quite a while now. It's quite likely that they've encountered things like Sanctioned Psykers and Librarians hurtling lighting and fireballs at them. Now, what does an intelligent, inquisitive species who has evolved at such a stunning rate do do when it encounters new enemy assets? That's right, it researches into them. I'm fairly certain that they have performed autopsies, genetic sampling, and all manner of tests in order to get a scientific explanation as to how some humans can manifest these powers. So, what I'm saying is their knowledge of how psychic abilities work might actually be better than the Imperium's. Just because they have no innate psychic powers and no interest in developing them doesn't mean they would automatically want to be oblivious to the phenomenon. I'm fairly certain the Tau Empire can spot a psyker when it emerges, and could probably even screen for them at birth. After all, even though the humans would govern and police themselves, it's still the Tau administration that keeps the census, while health facilities, schools and generally the whole infrastructure uses Tau know-how and technology to some degree,.\n\nRe: Why haven't the Tau had to deal with Chaos on any of their planets more often?\n\nthe thing is thay my theory that everyone (humans) is a psyker to some extant, actually explains why \"non psychic\" humans emotions have a warp echo (they basically broadcast their emotion uncontrolled through the warp at all times). Since in my theory they're not non psychic but just unable to control their psychic power. and while i a can agree that a beta psyker will never be an alpha psyker an untrained beta may become a beta+ as he becomes better at his thing, we've seen in all the role playing versions or warhammer and warhammer 40k psykers and wizards increasing in power as they get more experienced.\n\nno the lack of evidence isnt proof but it fits well with the evolving into a psychic spicies and evolving away the chaos gods stuff."}

{"text": "Did Guilliman force his brothers to adopt the Codex? And did he write it alone?\n\nThe fact that the Chapters are supposed to be independent makes it a bit hard for me to follow. You have a guide on how to run a chapter (written by a Primarch no less), but no practical means of enforcement. It's just up to each Chapter how seriously they want to take it. What was the point then, other than to annoy Dorn?\n\nYou have to consider at what time and in what circumstances it was written.\n\nIt was right after the Horus Heresy, after the Space Marine Legions had been traumatized and dishonoured by half of them turning against them. After such an event, they had to be dealing with doubts and despair; preventing a repetition of such an event had to be pretty much the highest priority point on their agenda. The Codex was, to a large part, written to redesign the Legions into something where the Heresy couldn't repeat itself. Hence Guilliman didn't have to force them into compliance - for the most part, in their shame and desperation, they accepted the Codex quite willingly - partially, probably, as a sort of penance for having allowed the Heresy to occur. And by the time that state was over, the Codex had already ingrained itself into the Space Marine identity.\n\nOr that's my interpretation of all of that, anyway.\n\nQuestion of my own. I recently started reading Fulgrim for another time, and while doing so noticed that, on the cover, there is a depiction of a Dreadnought. I also recall that there was at least one Dreadnought featured towards the end of Galaxy in Flames.\n\nNow, this seriously irritates me, because I'd have thought Dreadnoughts were something that came up only after the Heresy. Every codex containing Dreadnoughts keeps emphasizing how Space Marines are pretty much only interred in Dreadnoughts under the most dire circumstances, so there appears to be a serious reluctance to subject warriors to this fate. It makes sense though - after all, ever since the Heresy, Space Marines are in rather short supply for all the chapters, so preserving them in this fashion may, at times, just be necessary. The Legions though, before the Heresy and the civil war it entailed? They didn't have such a massive shortage on men - why would they have to make use of such an option?\n\n(Also, if Dreadnoughts were always used, how come none of the Dreadnoughts from before the Heresy have survived? Bjorn the Fell-Handed is explicitly stated to be the oldest one of them all, and he didn't become a Dreadnought until long after the Heresy - one would think that if Dreadnoughts were actually commonly used even back then, at least some would have survived by sheer coincidence.)"}

Report them on the Mantis Bugtracker! *ballpark, it's the **electromagnetic waves (which would be a closer referent to the word \"electricity\") that move at significant fractions of c.\n\n*ballpark?\n\n**electromagnetic waves is going more into the forms of radiation(which is electricaly charged particles), but the electric shuttle is not shooting out radiation, it is shooting(or rather \"releasing\") out just plain electricity(not particles). Electricity is the movement of elections, electromagnetic waves do have something to do with electrons, but that does not exactly make it electricity.\n\nIt depends on the medium; you could be looking at a millimeter per second, or 18,000 miles per second.\n\nQuote\n\nElectricity is the movement of elections, electromagnetic waves do have something to do with electrons, but that does not exactly make it electricity.\n\nIt depends on the dictionary, it seems, but I was referring to the presence and flow of electric charge, which does not depend on significant net movement of the electrons themselves.\n\nThe electric weapons in AI War presumably function by delivery of an electric charge sufficient to disrupt the normal operation of the target (including important stuff like, you know, reactor containment and nervous systems), as opposed to simply bombarding the ship with electrons like a particle beam or some such.\n\nLook i'm sorry :-) I did not want to spark this discussion and it is not like AI War is aiming for realism. From a physics point of view, the first thing to object would then be the movement of space ships and fixed structures around a planet or even spider turrets. I mean...if you kill the engines of a space craft it does not stop. It keeps on moving, and moving, and moving...\n\nSo i was basically yammering about lightning in space where the lightning supposedly visuallises flowing current (or as keith words it- charge delivery). Because the glowing jagged lines (in air such as during a thunderstorm) is a glowing plasma of heated gas as the current flows through the gas and additionally without medium there cannot be any current in the first place.\n\nI liked the idea of an artifical medium, although the Faraday-Cages probably would protect the ships even without warning. If the hull is conducting, the current will flow around the ship (but through the hull). If the hull is not conducting the current will flow around the ship (through the artificial medium). After the attack most of the ships will then probably be charged. This probably wouldn't have any larger effects as the inside of any charged object is free of electric fields. (The ships would repel each other though :-) ).\n\nAs for the drift speed vs speed of electricity the analogy of a garden hose explains the difference quite elegantly. Imagine a long garden hose (filled with water). Now you open the faucet and water will almost immediately pour out of the other end. However, it will take some time until the water that just left the faucet reaches the end of the hose."}
{"text": "Technical Briefing: Starships by Cameron Olson\n\nSUMMARY: This is a technical briefing on the starships used in my story universe and the technology associated with them. I'm only putting it here in case someone is actually interested.\n\nGrand Narrative Technical Briefing: Starships\n\n(Authors Note: These represent the physics applying to ships in my story world, not at all the real-world physics of which I have little understanding and often ignore entirely. I've been told numerous times that artificial gravity is essentially impossible and that shields are completely insane. I guess that's why it's called \"fiction\". \uf04a)\n\nMilitary starships from the Grand Narrative Universe fall into two major classes: Interstellar and Strike. The main difference between these two classes of craft is that the former has a hyperdrive while the latter does not. The second, and less distinct, difference is size. Interstellar craft are generally large (not less than 600 meters long) while Strike craft are generally small (almost never longer than 700 meters). The two classes exist because a hyperdrive is such a massive and power-hungry device that there are actually serious combat benefits to be had from not fitting one to a ship. The main one of these is acceleration and top speed, as any ship not fitting a hyperdrive can devote all the mass and energy it saves to having and running a larger and more powerful engine and a much more effective shield, as well as more weapons, though the lack of a hyperdrive has specific benefits to shields and engines. These benefits cannot be understood until the major functioning of a starship has been discussed and that must be done piece by piece.\n\nShape: Most starships are shaped like an oval with a crescent shaped bite out of the back end where the engines emerge and a large bulge above and below the area where the engines emerge from that contains the hyperdrive. Military vessels are more elongated and flattened, with an upper and lower shell of thick armor that leave only a narrow opening all the way around for weapons, sensors, and small-craft bays. Although aerodynamics have no place in space, the oval form works the best with the engine technology used, as well as with shielding technology and armor.\n\nPropulsion: The Grand Narrative universe has two modes of travel, those being sub-light and cheating (hyperspace). Sub-light speeds are generally kept below 0.4c (maximum of 0.6c for warships, 0.7c for strikecraft, 0.8c for very small courier ships), firstly because time-dilation is a nasty effect to mess around with in combat and secondly because the faster something is going the more energy it takes to speed it up more (or slow it down)."}

Either way it should result in no modules being dropped, or at the very most a chance for your cargo items to drop (I think this is the case now).Well, as for me, I never knew that SDing didn't drop anything and as far as I am concerned, they can hide/mask the mods of the SD'd ship on the mail and destroy everything in the ship (except for the salvagable wreck!) or somesuch shennanigans.

{"text": "Astrotrain\n\nFrom ArcenWiki\n\nNearly-indestructible robotic courier. Forms convoys and travels between Train Stations causing various problems for the human forces depending on the type of trains in the convoy. Note that Astrotrains do not have a direct attack themselves, they cause problems in other ways....\n\nAstrotrains are enabled individually for each AI under the AI Plots tab during game setup. The range varies from 0 (off) to 10 (nigh-impossible) with 4 being considered the default.\nWhile Astrotrains are extremely difficult to kill, some of the more dangerous ones are easier (relatively) to destroy.\n\nWhen this plot is enabled for an AI, it will spawn Astrotrain Stations on its planets that act as way points for the Astrotrains. Destroying Astrotrain stations reduces the AI's possible destinations and can be used to influence the routes the trains take.\n\nThis plot can be enabled for one or both AIs depending on the challenge you are looking for. Note that the higher this minor faction is set to the nastier the train types it will have access to are. Increasing the intensity of the minor faction will also result in larger convoys so their are more trains in total.\n\nTrain Types (Minimum Intensity to spawn)\n\nTrain Station (1):\n\nWaypoint for astro trains. Destroy to influence train routing. Causes 3 AIP on death. Note that the AI can build Train Stations once the game is under way by purchasing them from the Zenith Trader. Train stations bought this way do not incur any AIP on death. Stats\n\nArmor Booster (1):\n\nActs like the unit of the same name: boosts armor of all AI ships on the planet.\n\nArmor Inhibitor (7):\n\nActs like the unit of the same name: negates armor of all enemy-to-AI ships on the planet (also disables shields, like that unit does, though that may be changed in the future for both; it's a holdover from when the armor inhibitor was the shield inhibitor).\n\nAttack Booster (1):\n\nBoosts the attack of all AI ships on the planet.\n\nCargo Train (1):\n\nHarmless in itself, but each \"delivery\" contributes towards a counter for that player, and when that fills up (you'll see an alert once it's past 50%) it spawns some surprises. The spawns are unpleasant but not massively so (unless you're on intensity 8 or higher, where you're asking for it).\n\nEMP Train (6):\n\nBasically an EMP-guardian in train form. This is another one of the train types that's got way less hp and thus more feasible to destroy than others. If you have scouting on a planet with one of these, it shows up in the alert box.\n\nForcefield Jammer (7):\n\nPrevents human forcefields/shields from working on the planet it's on.\n\nGravity Train (4):\n\nHalves the speed of all enemy-to-AI ships on the planet.\n\nGravity Jammer (6):\n\nPrevents human gravity emitters from working on the planet it's on (the limited-range stuff, not planet-wide stuff like logistics stations or grav drills).\n\nNuclear Train (10):\n\nKinda like an EMP guardian, but only triggers on non-destroyed planets with a human command station present. Oh, and it's a nuke instead of an EMP. Destroys itself when it goes off. This is one of the train types that's got way less hp and thus more feasible to destroy than others. If you have scouting on a planet with one of these, it shows up in the alert box. If destroyed by hostile fire the nuclear explosion does not go off.\n\nRadar Jammer (4):\n\nActs like the unit of the same name: halves attack range of everything on the planet. There's also a MkII variant that only halves enemy (to the AI) ranges.\n\nRegenerator Train (1):\n\nResurrects AI units that are destroyed on the same planet. Sacrifices its own health to do so and resurrected units are teleported to a nearby AI planet nearby.\n\nRepair Train (1):\n\nBasically a super-MRS.\n\nShield Train (2):\n\nBasically a shieldbearer (the shield does not push enemy units). Has a lot less health than most of the other trains and is thus somewhat feasible to kill.\n\nSpeed Booster (1):\n\nBoosts the speed of all allied units.\n\nTachyon Train (2):\n\nProvides planet-wide tachyon coverage for the AI.\n\nTachyon Jammer (3):\n\nPrevents human tachyon emitters from working on the planet it's on.\n\nTractor Train (2):\n\nHas a bunch of tractor beams.\n\nTractor Jammer (6):\n\nPrevents human tractor beams from working on the planet it's on.\n\nWidow Train (4):\n\nHas a bunch of paralyzing tractor beams.\n\nNote that the intensity as listed is the lowest intensity you will see that type of train. As the intensity setting goes above this minimum the more you will see that type of train, and higher Marks of trains for the types that have abilities that scale.\n\nTrain Station\n\nTrain stations simply act as waypoints for Astrotrains and have no abilities or attack of their own.\n\nTrains Stats\n\nMost Astrotrains are high-health trains with their own special ability. Note that all trains have the Tachyon Emission Ability that varies based on the specific train type.\nMark level for Astrotrains is in relation to the special ability only, none of the trains base stats change based on Mark.\nThe following table lists the standard train stats, train specific abilities and other stats are listed below."}

You can check this yourself, get nextdoor to a planet and do nothing, see how the number of ships surrounding post/gates/CC increases. Now do the same but immidiatly after getting near the planet nuke the CC, the posts may perhaps still reinforce a little bit it is pretty non-existant. Similairly you can leave a CC and just nuke every post to deny the planet a large build-up.\n\nGuard posts do get ships every time the planet gets reinforced, but they cannot trigger reinforcements themselves. Thus, a planet with guard posts but no way to reinforce has no danger of getting more ships.\n\nYea, look out for those eyes. They are supposed to make the planet a pain to attack and the defend against, and they do that job pretty well. Thankfully, they are pretty rare.Yes. The more places the AI has to reinforce stuff to, the more ships that planet can have for defense (thanks to the max ships defending per guard post rules). In the most extreme example, If there is only one place that they can reinforce too (the command station), they won't be able to keep many ships on that planet."}

So to stop it, kill the hybrid.\n\nQuote\n\nAlso, I know that whatever it does involves the dyson Sphere. If I have freed it, will this still happen?\n\nHaven't updated this recently; distracted by Starcraft and AVWW. I'm taking the whole south arm through Xil then I'll rescue my fallen Brethren on Agria. Their Armor Rotters will be a nice addition to my fleet. The Dyson Antagonizer finished and now the Gatling fleets are duking it out. I'll take out the Antagonizer while I'm capturing the Fabricator on Agria.\n\nA massive AI attack catches me off-guard A thousand ships to Moatbiqui and five hundred to my outpost on Kuu. My main fleet is more than enough to defend Moatbiqui but Kuu only makes it thanks to some well-timed Resistance fighters showing up.\n\nNext on the list is to eliminate that antagonizer. The Dyson is slowly destroying its old underlings, time to put an end to that! However, as my fleet moves into position, Hybrids attack my rear and bring my home command to half health before they are destroyed. Worse, as soon as I defeat these, a second hubrid warning comes from the other end of my territory! I rush to defend and again only arrive just in time.\n\nAnd so the battle for Agria begins. My fleet easily cuts through the two planets along the way, but as soon as we arrive at Agria we hit a little snag.\n\nAn eye. Curses! In this picture I'm in the process of scattering my fleet to eliminate guard posts ASAP. Eventually the eye and Zombies fall but I lose a quarter of my fleet, including some Mk. III Blade spawners. Oh well, Agria is ours!\n\nI notice that I've picked up quite a few polarizers. Leeches FTW I guess.\n\nUm. Two Super Hybrids? Uh-oh. A second warning keeps flashing onto my screen at times. This can't be good. In other news, Vanadia has been assimilated. With it comes Mk. V Space planes. The Spire's fleet is growing. Soon we shall rescue a small group of our survivors on Agria. Their Armor rotters will come in handyIt depends on which particular group of Spire you're dealing with, though I don't think any of them would object to mercenaries in the face of incredible odds unless those mercenaries were obviously really really untrustworthy people.\n\nAs for actual availability, hmm; I doubt Spire themselves would be interested in being mercenaries (for the \"good\" ones because they wouldn't really want to leave their community, for the \"bad\" ones because they wouldn't be interested in working with \"lesser\" races merely for financial gain), but presumably if it's the Milky Way galaxy and the humans and zenith (and even neinzul) have been bopping around for however many years, there'd be somebody to hire.\n\nIt's just that I have this colossal pile of resources and nothing to do with it. I need to take Agria to rescue my fallen brethren but with a CPA in nine minutes I'm not sure if I'll be able to fortify it in time. So to play it safe I'm just building as many defences as my energy budget will allowThose aren't humans. They're the best damned ships the humans ever figured out how to build and we STOLE IT. Damned shame we couldn't borrow a few humans too to pilot those boats. Guess we'll just reconfigure the cockpit. Soooo expensive though....\n\nThe survivors on Agria are going to have to wait for now. A much larger band of Spire refugees has been rescued from Adia along with one of their powerful warships. Pleased to find more of our own species, we welcomed them and constructed an additional habitat on Moatbiqui. It seems that these survivors held on to some blueprints for our advanced craft. Sixteen Frigates, a mere fragment of our former glorious fleet but it is better than nothing. A good compliment to our Siege towers, in any case.\n\nThe AI response was severe, but nothing that Blade Spawners couldn't handle. I expect it to get worse in the future.\n\nAlso complicating the situation is the recent change in the Dyson's attitude to the Spire. The AI did something that ticked it off and now it's become hostile to our forces. A few gatlings are no match for sever heavy beam cannons and laser turrets, but it should be high priority to destroy whatever the AI has constructed. Easier said than done, however, as our advanced scouting network has not detected the exact location, other than that it is \"somewhere in the galaxy.\" Very helpful.\n\nThese new refugees are looking into maybe finding some of our old reactors, if they're still floating around somewhere in Space."}

{"text": "Have you tried the second edition of the game? It plays much faster than the original and there's no annoying 15 minute set up. I'd recommend giving it a go. A starter and a few boosters are all you need to make a competative deck.\n\nI used to play several CCG's. Start Trek, Star Wars (I have Darth Vader's SSD, though I can't remember it's name. I refused to let my friend talk me into trading him that one), Magic: The Gathering, and (of course) MechWarrior.\n\nHowever, it has been several years since I played any of them, and I'm not sure I really remember how to anymore. Was the card you showed the link to from the 2nd edition ST:CCG? If so, then that's what I played, since the card layout looks exactly like what I hadthe Tech is the same but the use is diffrent in Star trek the use their main MAM reactors to create a similer KF field but inb BT they use solar sales for this (as it is lees demanding then using 100;s of tons of fuel fore a single jump) the sip in the card uses the sail as a Staionary collector that does not use all the power is collects\n\nI don't think the technology is the same. Mainly because the Star Trek warp drive enables a ship to actually travel at speeds faster than light, whereas the K-F drive in BattleTech basically brings two points in space together and the ship passes directly from one point to another.\n\nWhat I was referring to being similar was the uses for the sail. Both in Star Trek and BattleTech, the ships use the sail for the same purpose, to collect energy (albeit collecting different kinds of energyNo matter which way the idea is used Both drive use the same principles. <b>bend two points between space through the use of a hyperspace tunnel(wormhole)</b> the difference is the Starships in Star Track can go for a virtually unlimited distance and time because of the power plant they use. In battle tech the Jumps are limited to five minutes and take almost a week to charge and they are limited to 30 Light years. In relation to what I have said before Because of this M/AM reactor in Star track they do not need to use a Solar sail for FTl travel like in Battle tech that ship on the card is a power plant for other ships to use\n\nas for FTL: velocity is relative from one point to another in a certain amount of time Ftl is defined by a greater relative distance/ time than 300,000m/s a 30 light year jump in five minutes or 4 light years in a few minutes(here to nearest star) is over this lmit science no object can travel faster than light there must be a use of hyper space with this 30 light years can be turned into an actual distance of a few atomic diameters\n\nThat's never been dealt with in the series. I suspect it would be considerably less troublesome than a ship actually impacting a planet at x times the speed of light, but everyone aboard would probably still be killed, and the planet would be pretty thrashed, too dunno if E=MC2 is applicable here, but something hitting a planet at the speed of light is indeed going to do major damage. So a warp shuttle becomes a potenital planet buster, unless they come up with some explanation that Warp is pseudo velocity and an impact would cause minimal damage.\n\nActually, the reason why noone warps in too close to planets is because the warp drive tends to have rather nasty accidents if it is engaged within a gravity well.\n\nIIRC, the initial warp drive concept was nearly canned when they tried to test-fire it on the moon and it ended up vaporizing a small section of it. Or something like that. Or maybe I'm thinking of a different sci-fi universe. God, I can't keep these things straight"}

Its no fun to be the 1 guy that spawns in an arena, when the other team is full! Its no fun to be the full team hunting down the one guy that did spawn!\n\n2) Why is it, that we have to queue up for a particular map? Why can't we just queue up for the next available space map, or the next available ground map? I'd live in one (or both) of those queues if they were available, because I don't care which of the three maps I get when I queue for space or ground ... in fact, almost every team I'm on, always queues for all three maps of whatever type of PvP they want to do.\n\n3) Something is wrong with the map queuing logic .... I am talking to my friends, they are in assimilated cruiser ... there's three of them in there. They say, \"Come into assimilated with us.\" So I queue. I get put in a map by myself with ZERO opponents ... and they still only have 3 in their instance of it ... against a full team of opponents. Come on.\n\n4) While I applaud the effort made with the queuing system in the last patch, you apparently broke something, because now, if you queue and change maps (go to a different sector, enter a fleet action, warp out of a mission) it randomly drops you from a (or even all) queue.\n\n5) Set up the maps so that when the other team leaves the arena because they don't want to lose (or let you win) ... it starts a 2m timer .... at the end of that 2m, the arena starts awarding the team that still there 1 point every 15s until they win or opponents come into the arena.\n\n6) Once you fixed it, so people only go in with full teams ... anyone leaving an arena should have a 15m cool down timer before they can queue for any further PvP.\n\n7) No one should respawn on top of an opponent. No one. That is just non-sense. I can't count how many times I've respawned alone in the middle of an entire team of opponents, or visa versa.\n\n8) Spawn camping should be a NO! Seriously, every time you log into a game one side or the other is spawn camping!\n\nI won't even get into the all the graphics problems of the maps ... that's already been discussed.\n\nAn entire faction is dependant on a broken system.

{"text": "The design system appears to be taken from WEG's old game Shatterzone and mashed up with some elements from the Star Wars d6 game. It's fairly easy to use but includes a few oddities, such as engines being the same size no matter how big the ship actually ends up being. In the examples, an 879-ton corsair (220 m long) with a speed of 8 has a drive that's 10 tons, while a dinky one-person fighter with the same speed has a drive exactly the same size.

Along with giving character creation.\nPlease fix this. I want to try and play it most of them good in my opinion. I have always prefered the freedom of the D6 system to most of the others that I have encountered, you just pick a skill and role the dice, and don't worry about feats or bonuses or anything like that. The additions this brings to that simple formula might bring some complexity, but I think they give some good fleshing out to things such as unusual characters and talents. Best of all, its free and plugs pretty much right in with any of the old D6 stuff you still have lying around.

If you area fan of Dune, Foundation or of the D6 system, then this really is a must have.\n\nNothing turns me off a game faster than a vague, confusing character generation system. You are told you get 18D to divide between your six Attributes, and how many you can put in any one attribute. Ok, clear. But then you are told to \"prioritize\" your other abilities, like Skills, Modfications, Resources, but not told how many dice this prioritization gives you for each. If I make Skills my top priority, how many D do I have to divide between them? How many skills? How do I determine at chargen how much Resources and nanotech I get? Where I come from? No word that I can find is devoted to these pressing questions. At the very least, the information is unclear. Also, something called \"Steel Helix\" is repeatedly mentioned as effecting the setting but is never simply explained."}

{"text": "mynameisgrax\n\nI've crunched the numbers, read a lot of threads, and have come to the painful realization that until a major errata is made to 6th edition regarding flyers, there are only six competitive army 'types' in tournaments:\n\nI guess you could say that there's only one type of competitive army right now: those that have access to inexpensive flying transports.\n\nYes, Blood Angels/Grey Knights Stormravens also have flying transports, but they're generally too expensive to be used in the 'game breaking' way that Night Scythes and Valkyries/Vendettas are used now, except perhaps at the highest point levels, so they're less competitive than the others.\n\nMost armies have some sort of flying unit, but since flying vehicles and flying monstrous creatures can't claim objectives (and as far as I know, only the monstrous creatures can even contest them), it's the transports that can carry troops to claim objectives that cause the trouble.\n\nHere's the problem: after arriving from reserve, flyers can immediately re-enter reserve. You just have them fly in near a table corner, leaving the one table edge and re-entering the other. Why is this broken? Because it enables you to have them all arrive on turn 5. With their speed, they can easily move to any unattended or weakly defended objectives, and drop your troops off on them.\n\nIn order to compete, an army without flying transports will have to simultaneously claim/contest the majority of the objectives on the board with units capable of defeating an Imperial Guard unit loaded with special guns (flamers/plasmas/meltas/demo charges), and/or 10 Immortals with a Necron Lord attached.\n\nThis changes a game that used to be 5-7 turns of struggle into a 1-3 turn endgame spree, with just about everything being decided by late arriving troops in 5 out of the 6 missions.\n\nSo who are the big losers? The only two armies who cannot get access to a flying transport one way or another: Dark Eldar and Tyranids.\n\nHow can this be fixed? As I see it, one of two ways: FAQ/Erratas need to either forbid flyers to fly back into reserve the turn they arrive, or allow all reserve/deep striking units to choose whether or not they enter the field or go back into reserve (won't solve the endgame problem, but at least it'll level the playing field).\n\nIn short, flying transports have f*cked the game balance in 40k 6th edition the same way magic f*cked it in Warhammer Fantasy 8th edition.\n\nIn other words: now's a good time to start playing Necromunda instead.\n\nComments\n\nShrug, you could always just make up a house rule that forces flyers to spend at least one turn on the table, so there's at least some exposure to AA fire. I'm fairly sure the big Nova tourney is doing something like that to prevent people from abusing that ability.\n\n...Or your gaming group could just dissuade those you game with from using such tactics in-game, especially if it's detrimental to the groups enjoyment of the game. 40k, and the meta used to play it, is only as bad as you, and those you game with, allow it to be. It doesn't really matter what 'waac' netlists and exploits/abuses pop up if everyone in your group agrees not to take advantage of them to grieve each other.\n\nedit: Though if you are looking are other systems to get into, might I suggest Infinity. It's squad-sized skirmish action similiar to Necromunda, with an average of 8-12 models per side. The setting is based on sci-fi high-tech black ops. Gameplay features a mechanic of models being able to react during an opponents turns whenever an opposing model acts within their line of sight (ex. return fire or dodging).\n\nIt's very balanced with generally all the units being viable, meaning you can take exactly what you want most times without worrying if it'll be 'good' or not. And the models themselves tend to be gorgeous.\n\nIt's also very cheap to get into, the 35usd starter packs come with around enough to play 125-150pts games, with standard games being 250-300pts. Free rules are available on their website and there's a wiki for quick reference and FAQ. Infinity: the Game\n\nWarning: it is a very terrain intensive game and not having sufficient line-of-sight blocking terrain can ruin it."}

{"text": "Still trying to figure out what to do with these. I created them for a client that just wanted the images and not the actual designs and let me keep the models to use where I wanted. Thinking of having the Free Colonies use them as they grow out of the Terran Protectorate's surplus hand-me-downs...\n\nHrmm, the issue with texturing is that unless you're UV map painting, which I haven't got down yet, each rendering engine is different. I've found that I learn by experimentation and trying random settings to see what they do in different ways. As for the mechanics of texturing, the one thing people tend to forget is that there is a lot of human psychology that is involved. Slight undertones of color make us instinctively like, dislike or fear certain things. You look at these ships and, even if you couldn't see the guns, you'd probably think \"human military\" just because of the colors. They also say \"authority.\" You immediately know they're not pirate vessels. Even the textures are rather an orderly patchwork of metal plates to give you that mindset. If you're doing some alien vessel, lurid reds, oranges, greens, whatever we would NOT use but could still look believable as metal is good. Stay away from orderly tile textures and use something unpredictable, like an animal print, or a random fractal scale,like pattern. Or even a tile shape that we don't usually build with, like triangles or octagons. One of the most important things is to make your ship look used. There's two ways to do this: in the program or in the postwork. Some programs (like Carrara) have a really good texturing room where you can do things like mix in a dark colored noise pattern. You do that right and you'll get a nice, non-repeating dispersion of dirt and wear. If you do the same thing to the bump map, you can really make a ship look scored up. Alternately, soft cloud and smoke brushes (like Ron's smoke and fog brushes at Daz3d.com) in post work are great for that as well. You just switch to the \"burn\" tool in your photo editing program, use a smoke or fog brush and dirty the ships up that way. That was what was done in this pic. Hope that helps some. A lot depends on the program you're"}
{"text": "Cheers\n\nDavid\n\nThe normal build-time comes as the last step of the tactical action. Thus, building in a system requires you to activate the system in question. And since you only can activate non-activated systems there is, in general, a \"one build per system\" limit.\n\nCertain circumstances (i.e. strategy cards) allow you to build in a system that is already activated though. They are, off the top of my head, the Imperial and Imperial II secondaries, the Production primary and the Industry Primary. The latter is only used in the \"Fall of the Empire\" scenario from Shards of the Throne.\n\nThat might sound like a limitation, only one (possibly two) build action per spacedock per round, but you have to plan around your space docks. Placing all three in one trinary planet system, allowing for one very big push of units but only from one point on the map, will play very differently to having them spread to 3 different systems, which has its own strategic advantages and disadvantages.\n\nIn Memoriam: Lest we Forget their Brave Sacrifice, Citizens of Arkham!\n\nI should also mention the tactic of using the Warfare primary to pick a placed CC back up from an activated system allowing you to activate, and subsequentially build in it, a second time.\n\nThis leads me to conclude that with some luck and sly persuasion/mindgaming you could potentially build up to four(!) times in the same system.\n\nOnce via the [8]Imperial or [8]Imperial II secondary.\nOnce via regular activation\nOnce via either [4]Production primary or the above mentioned [6]Warfare primary tactic.\nOnce via the Action Card that is essentially a copy of the [6]Warfare primary.\n\nIn a three or four player game you actually have the possible potential to build up to five(!!) times IF you can procure both [4]Production AND [6]Warfare.\nIf you can actually afford to build five times, however, is another matter.\nYou should also try to move the built units away from the system in question between builds. So to pull this sequence off effectively you would need at least 5CCs to spare.\n\nIf you have Sarween Tools and all Space Docks in a triplanet system You can use the above mentioned tactic to get 30(!) fighters or ground forces without paying a single resource. Perfect for a Sol player with his flagship out\u2026\n\nThere are other Action cards and that will allow more builds if you combo them.\n\nI am not sure if these action cards came with the original game? Action cards like these is why you get the expansions.\n\n\"Touch of Genius\"(duplicate an action card), \"Synchronicity\"(take any action card from the deck and shuffle the deck) , \"Unexpected action\".

{"text": "\"EVE Online's complicated inter-corporate politics are often held together by fragile diplomatic treaties and economic agreements. So fragile, in fact, that a single misclick can lead to a fracas that quickly snowballs into all-out warfare. That's what happened to two of the spacefaring sandbox MMO's largest player alliances in the Battle of Asakai, a massive fleet vs. fleet onslaught involving 3,000 players piloting ships ranging from small interceptors to gargantuan capital ships. Straight from the wreckage-strewn outcome of the battle, we're breaking down the basics of what happened for everyone to truly fathom one of the biggest engagements in the game's history.\" The costs of this battle in in-game currency is, so far, 700 billion. While MMO's don't float my boat, I have to say that this is still pretty awesome. Penny Arcade looks at the technical details server-side, and what a battle like this does to the game's backend infrastructure.\n\nI want to avoid getting lost in the weeds when it comes to terminology is all...\n\nA distributed system is really just a collection of network connected machines running software to facilitate a common goal.\n\nBitTorrent is a good example of a distributed system. So is Seti@Home and the other examples you gave.\n\nBut one of the things you mentioned is live migration. One way to do live between two nodes in simple layman's terms:\n\n1. On the source node, snapshot the current servers complete state, and start doing incremental differential snapshots at set intervals.\n2. Send the full snapshot to the destination node. Once it has it, start sending the incrementals until you get \"caught up\"\n3. Freeze the state on the source node, send the last incremental to the destination and have it wake up, and then direct all clients to reconnect to the destination node.\n\nMy point is this process has absolutely nothing to do with distributed computing - it is the same process you would go through if you only had one server and wanted to migrate to another one. It also has an achilles heel, namely the larger the amount of state and the faster it changes, the longer it takes to complete. There is almost always a significant amount of \"lag\" involved with a fall over unless the amount of state is trivial.\n\nAll I was getting at is that EVE Online may be a poorly designed systems in some respects (I really don't know much about it), but the deficiencies you mentioned don't have anything to do with it being more or less distributed...\n\nTake seti@home... How does it deal with a non-responsive node (i.e. a user's computer that goes offline)? It simply moves on - give the work to someone else. The point is the system doesn't care about a node going away, because all a node is to it is a compute resource working on a small dataset. For seti@home, compute cycles are the gold - they don't care about latency because it doesn't matter to them.\n\nEVE is the opposite - the problem they have to solve is reducing the latency to a large number of clients in a world represented by a shared state - latency is their gold. Performing compute in separate \"islands\" is the way they reduce latency.\n\nThey are both distribute systems, but they are almost opposite in purpose and design. The bigger an EVE backend node is, the more clients it can handle with low latency, but the more state it has to manage. Live migration of a large amount of state, without negatively impacting the latency of the users, is simply not an easy problem to solve. Not saying it can't be done, just that it isn't trivial and it would almost certainly not be transparent to the users"}

My current build more or less relies on a combination of two Tactical Team 1's and an RSP for the majority of tanking, with TSS and EptS for shield recovery and HE for hazard debuffing and a small hull heal.\n\nI don't realistically have ROOM to squeeze in a Sci Team to counter the sci-spam BS I come across, or the sci-based P2W attacks that get used like cheese. Putting that in requires opening a big gap in my TT coverage, which is what keeps me alive 50-60% of the time. It also requires me to sacrifice a boff skill that I KNOW I get a lot of use out of. . .there are no 'unused' skills on my Hegh'ta.\n\nSo, the 'just lacking adequate preparation' line doesn't cut it with me, especially since you'd be hard pressed to have a build set up to respond to every friggin bit of cheese that's out there (AMS, gravitic pulse, danubes, subnukes/subnuke doffs, general sci spam, etc).\n\nMy list of what I consider OP isn't TOO big. I don't consider subspace jump to be OP, for example. I don't consider Theta Radiation to be OP. Most P2W stuff is generally ok with me, they're items of reasonable utility (heck, I'm using two P2W items myself!). Mostly, I get pissed off at stuff like AMS spam the instant you shoot someone, gravitic pulses that render you helpless in regards to escaping/maneuvering, 2-3 subnukes getting stacked onto you, danube spam (especially combined with other cheap BS tricks).\n\nIf you open that up to variants of the ship and you have a deal. For example the temporal set is what gives the Wells it's power so allow it to work on any temporal ship. Or the Excelsior console (Now only sold on the CMDR version) leave that available to all Excelsior variants.\n\nDo this and I will support your idea all the way\n\nQuestion will be if other players are willing to give up their toys. If not, were back to the drawing board.\n\nCo-founder of The Spanish Inquisition TSI - Cause no one expects it!\n\nPaxOttomana: gawd mirror event is like fighting a tsi premade, they keep comin and comin!"}

Does your chosen field, (Engineering, Tactical, Science) have any bearing on which skills are better for you?\n\nIt seems to me that it's safe to get Starship Command, Warp Core Training, Energy Weapons and Projectile Weapons to 7 pts each ASAP. After that, it seems to be up to personal preference. Some people max select skills out at 9 points and neglect others entirely, but I think those are risky decisions to make given the limited information we've been given on what the Tier 1 skills actually do and don't do."}

Mostly noobs and people who better do some first person shooter flame here! Excuse me. But this game is not only for CRF freaks. Its for tacticians. Some TBR or Grav well, APO or evasive maneuvers do the trick. Its not too difficult. Render the trics useless does not seem to be apropriate.\nRather nerf the CRF spammers to encourage them to think of something creative.\n\nWhoever read this thread already can be fully capable of rendering any tricobalt build totally useless.\"Live Long and Prosper but always carry a fully charged phaser, just in case!\". Arrr'owCould you explain why you're in the PvP boards if you don't care about it?\n\nThe Dev tracker is the devil! Point of fact, most of these folk wouldn't even notice a change if not for it or word of mouth.\n\nSeriously though, I think it's important to get as many voices in on a conversation as possible. It could really be better for the game as a whole. Unfortunately, for that to work all of the voices chiming in would need to actually care enough to educate themselves about how what works and why.\n\nTric spammers are not tacticians. They are PvE heroes who can't play worth a damn, so they use the currently insane damage and crit bonuses of Trics with DPB to get kills they otherwise wouldn't get.\n\nBtw, any of the people complaining about Trics in this thread, especially the fleets, could use those setups and troll the hell out of the queues, basically shutting them down.\n\nThey don't do that because it's lame and because they don't want to ruin what little community still plays the game.\n\nTrics are not the issue, it's the chained crits from DPB. To say that there is no tact involved is an overstatement when most PvP'rs now keep an eye out for them and know when to hit CSV, TBR, FAW, APO, Aceton Assimilators, AMS, EM, EWP, VTR.\n\nPersonally, I find the Jem Attack Ship a bigger issue because it makes lousy PvP'rs seem respectable, marginally decent PvP'rs competative and once exceptional PvP'rs look godly. It's training wheels that scale upward with player skill. It's not available to everyone and those who have it will defend it to the death because they'd never fly anything else.\n\nI don't always use torpedoes but when I do, I prefer Tricobalts.

{"text": "more challenge; mechanics like space combat and the properties of weapons are changing from patch to patch; e.g., at some point--and I can't find the release note that includes it--cannons stopped having a shared cooldown. Such changes can impact documentation like tooltips, so it's a moving target as well as being a big one.\n\nThis is actually a big issue to me, and a lot of other players I believe, Phoxe. I hope that we get free respecs every time a major, fundamental change to the game system comes out. If I build a character based on One system, and that system is completely overhauled and replaced, we really do deserve a free respecification of our characters. Its a change by no fault of our own. I realize that the game will change, and be tweaked and made to be better and better, as well as more fair. I just think it should be fair to those who have invested in traits that are being completely redefined. I actually wouldn't be surprised if they do this though, its a very logical choice after all.\n\nEspecially when it comes to maneuverability.... I'm actually surprised how well my cruiser handles compared to an escort... especially seeing as the cruiser has a mass at least 1000 times that of an escort.\n\nYou're forgetting this is in space, not water. There's only so much you can do with mechanically driven props that can only be mounted in one plane. In space, if you're 1000 times more massive, you just put thrusters that produce 1000 times more force, in the exact same orientations as the ship that's a 1000 times less massive as you and both ships should do the exact same thing."}

Little is known about its mechanisms, other than that it produces quantum fluctuations that can affect personnel within its range, and leaves a wake that can affect other starships.[1]\n\nIt is possible that repulsor engines are a form of \"reactionless drive\" that make use of negative matter. Negative matter would have negative mass and would have a \"repulsive\" effect on the normal matter of the ship if placed behind it."}
{"text": "As the DIY guide mentions, the science behind the detector is pretty simple to understand and explain. The reason the really good detectors are so expensive is because they have been very carefully calibrated and tuned, and have much more sensitive electronics in them.\n\nIndeed, if you take it for a test drive, you can take it to a friendly shop (maybe fora small fee) and they'll hoist it up and see if there's any major defects.\n\nAt the absolute least, you can drive it around for about an hour, see if anything sounds weird, and go to an O'Reily or Autozone and have them plug in an ODB2 reader to get data off all the cars sensors. They are always happy to do this for free btw, for anyone has had their Check Engine light come on and want to know why.\n\nAssuming you already have an orbit, but it's elliptical, here's what you do:\n\n1) Thrust either prograde or retrograde until either your periapsis or apoapsis reaches the altitude you want your circle to be at.\n\n2) Time accel until you reach the periapsis/apoapsis, whichever is opposite of the node that is at your target altitude.\n\n3) Thrust retrograde until your periapsis/apoapsis nodes try to flip sides (it will happen very suddenly!). You should be very close to circular at this point, and you can add a little extra thrust to try and tweak it if you want to.\n\nTo further explain this, the earlier you burn in a trajectory, the less fuel you have to use. Picture a cone, with your ship at the point. A very long tall skinny cone is when you burn early. The angle of the cone is very narrow (indicating very little fuel is needed to change direction). If you have a short fat cone with the same size base, the angle is larger, indicating you're going to have to burn a lot more fuel to get to the same place since you waited longer.\n\nI always thought that was pretty awesome to do/watch. Coordinate the entire platoon to skydrop onto a target at the same time, and watch the hail of drop pods descending beside you (or on you!). Really cool sight IMO. Never seemed overpowered either, because usually what happens is that everyone is fairly randomly spread out, making it very difficult to form a front or flank anything more than small clusters of enemies.\n\nDepends on where you need to go. DHL can be pretty affordable, especially to some of the more out of the way countries. If you do ship it, make sure you get the customs documentation squared away correctly, or you may end up having to pay import taxes on it, which can be as high as 30% of the declared value (most EU countries for instance).\n\nI'd recommend shipping it via a shipping company (UPS, Fedex, DHL). They're going to treat it way better than any airline. And if it does get damaged, you can claim the insurance that you put on it (you did pay the extra $5 for insurance right?).\n\nI put a tower on a flight from Arizona to LA once. It got there with a dent in the side (inside a box with peanuts!) and the CPU cooler had snapped clean off it's mounting brackets. How the GPU didn't snap off the PCI slot I'll never know.\n\nIt is something that is occasionally wrapped on games that also have a Mac version\n\nThis is not correct. Using the GFW logo on a game requires the game to adhere to a specific set of requirements laid out by Microsoft. Among them is support for the Xbox controller. Having a set of standards is not an entirely bad idea, and most of the requirements are sensible.\n\nHaving the GFWLive logo on the other hand, means that the game uses and requires the GFWL online multiplayer service, which is a cock-sucking stain of a system built on the crumbled ruins of broken dreams."}
{"text": "What would you suggest be the point of categories then, in a tech tree of the current basic layout? If they're not useful to sort by what sort of things techs do, then how are players going to use categories, and how are players going to find techs that do a particular sort of thing?You are conflating two different issues. My complaint here is about the categories. There's no rule that a tech can only unlock new techs in the same category. But i would argue rather strongly that for instance, planetary stealth screens should not be in the \"ships\" category merely because the technobabble explains them with similar imaginary science , and some ship part tech is a prerequisite for the planetary stealth screens. Weather planetary stealth screens should have ship part tech as a prerequisite is more debatable.\n\nI also disagree with your assumption the only interesting research decision is between the new techs unlocked by the last thing he researched. Weather detectors are all in the same branch or scattered willy-nilly all over the tree, the player is still making the same essential choice-- weather he wants to prioritize better detectors now, or something else.\n\nOf course there is no category that that planetary stealth screens, or a good amount of other stuff could naturally fall in. That's what i'm compiling about. Because i'm worn out i don't have constructive alternatives at this timeI haven't read the whole thread, so i hope nobody else has already come up with this idea. But I think you should highlight in the tech tree, which technologies give rise to buildings, ship improvements etc. and which are just prerequisites for other technologies.

Now they'll do higher \"real\" DPS, so they should have short range to balance this.\n\nBlasters\n\nShort range, bad tracking, and DPS which many find isn't worth it.\n\nThe Solution: Buff the blaster damage modifier.\n\nNow when they do hit, it really counts.\n\nThe Dramiel\n\nLots of slots, good EHP, really fast, and three drones makes the Dramiel probably the most hated, \"overpowered\" ship in EVE.\n\nThe Solution: Drop the EHP levels down to slightly below that of a T1 Rifter.\n\nWhile it's still fast and annoying, it will die in one or two good hits from a medium sized ship.\n\nThe Retribution\n\nThe Retri is commonly disliked because of one mid slot, which makes it useless for solo PVPers, and useless as a tackle boat, even though it's a frigate which is supposed to be fun with both of those things.\n\nThe Solution: Remove a turret hardpoint and a high slot, add a medium slot.\n\nThe Retri will still have its impressive five-low slot layout, allowing for impressive tank, but it no longer has four guns, and can actually tackle stuff now.\n\nAssault Ships\n\nThey have no clearly defined role, and almost everything they do is done better by a cruiser.\n\nThe Solution: Bring back the AB bonus, anyone? (Props to Darius McClever)\n\nThis allows them to travel fast enough to catch nano cruisers and whatnot while not running their cap dry with a MWD at the risk of being shut down by a scram. They also have the ability to tank a bit, but they won't be as fast as an inty.\n\nECM!\n\nNO MORE CHANCE BASED ABILITY TO STOP YOUR ENEMY FROM DOING EVERYTHING!\n\nThe Solution: Make each ECM have a set jam strength (depending on whether it's racial or multispec) and each ship a set sensor strength. We already have this, but instead, now the ship WILL be jammed if the total jam strength applied to it goes higher than its total sensor strength, but WILL NOT be jammed if it is too low. Make sure to re-work the jam strength and sensor strength numbers so this isn't too overpowered/underpowered. NOTE: Ideally, they would be re-worked so it takes one max-skilled falcon to permajam a frig-cruiser, and two or more for BCs and battleships.\n\nNow it won't be as \"HAHAHA you're in hull, oh **** I've been jammed for 20secs by a single ECM drone, now he's going to kill me.\"\n\n-------\n\nThat's all I could think of on the spot. Thoughts? Suggestions? Improvements?\n\nOriginally by:Ninetails o'Cat1. No. The Sacrilege is intended to be a short range active tanking boat IIRC, and losing the armour resist bonus is far too big a sacrifice for that.\n\n2. Maybe, I'd rather have an armour amount bonus, but I'm strange like that. Or even a Hybrid ROF bonus.\n\n3. See the many, many threads about this.\n\n4. Meh, maybe\n\n5. No, just lose some of the drones and it will be far more reasonable.\n\n6. Just move a high to a mid, no turret changes.\n\n7. AFs don't fit an afterburner because of fitting constraints, but more normally because they are thought to preform better with a AB/warp scram combination.\n\n8. Hell no, that's how it used to work, and it was worse than now.\n\nI don't find the Sac to be too great of an active tanker. Slapping reps on it means less damage mods, giving it similar damage to the Myrmi, which has a better active tank.\n\nAbout the rockets, yes, I know, there are other threads. But if my list of fixable things didn't have such a major issue, I'd also be getting flamed, no?\n\nAs for the Dramiel, losing some drones would not fit in with the whole RP thing. Angel ships are a cross between Minmatar and Gallente - Minmatar with speed and ACs, and Gallente with larger-than-normal drone bays. If the Dramiel has no drones, then players theoretically shouldn't have a reason to train Gallente frigate.\n\nAnd finally, on ECM... D'oh, you're right, good point. Have you any other solutions while I mull it over?\n\n@ Darius: It's not because the Dramiel is \"impossible\" to kill, it's just because it's so much mmore powerful than the other frigates.\n\nPeople \"flying\" active Brutixes doesn't necessarily mean it's a good idea. Youtube isn't working for me atm, so I can't verify anything about those videos. Obviously, a rep Brutix is going to kill some things, but does that mean it's on par with other BCs? Not necessarily.\n\nAnd yeah, I forgot about that proposed AB bonus. I suppose it would be cool if they implemented that."}
{"text": "point of autocannon heavy bolter predator ?\n\nIts only 85pts...And large numbers of little creatures do not die in close combat against marines (I'm assuming vanilla here). Basically when faced with a choice of devasator squad or Predator the Predator is much cheaper. But they are used for different things. One is anti-horde/AV10 vehicles, the other is anti-monstrous creature and Transport.\n\nI ran 2 in the lastest tounrey I took part in. Proved very good against marines in cover (where weight of fire trumps plasma) and against a Nid wall of little critters. I have however just bought 2 Auto/Las ones to try out. Also it must be said with Auto/Bolter they aren't a target priority for the enemy. Only lost them in one game (against the nids - by zoanthrope).\n\nRe: What is the point of autocannon heavy bolter predator ?\n\nAh thats awesome thanks. So say a bunch of 4+ or 3+ enemies fall out of the transport. You can't get through their armour with a heavy bolter. What do you do then ? What if marines fall out of the transport? You won't be able to kill them. What do you do then ?\n\nRe: What is the point of autocannon heavy bolter predator ?\n\nTarget them with something else :P\n\nJust because they still get an armour save doesn't mean they won't fail it. Also the Predator would have a supporting unit nearby (in my case I had a plasma toting 5 man tactical squad and a plasma razorback) that can deal mwith marines. Basically nothing is an isolated unit. In the army I ran with 2 Dakka Predators if I'd taken out a marine transport then they'd recieve 7 krak missiles (if in the open or frag in cover) to the face. As I tend to run Typhoons (and at the time ran 4 missile devastators).\n\nAlso worth pointing out my new list that I'm giving a go on Tuesday has 2 Auto/Las Predators, 1 Dakka Predator, 2 Rifleman Dreads and a TL Lascannon/Fist/Heavy Flamer Dread. That way it has a metric smeg load of shooting before adding in my fast attack choices :P\n\nRe: What is the point of autocannon heavy bolter predator ?\n\nI played in a tounament where a guy pulled out his unit of TH/SS Terminators. I made a point of wiping them out with bolter fire.\n\nI want to buy a third Predator so I can have 3 with Autocannon/Hvy Bolter, and I want to run them in the same army with my 3 Landspeeders with 2 hvy bolters each. I don't care what kind of save you have, that will hurt alot for fairly cheap.\n\nNote: my Landspeeders with the 2 Hvy Bolters, have always preformed well just by sheer volume of Strength 5 shots.\n\nRe: What is the point of autocannon heavy bolter predator ?\n\nAs other posters have pointed out, the Dakka Pred is incredibly cheap for an eight shot AV13 vehicle.\n\nThe problem with the AC/LC Pred is that generally sponsons aren't very good. They're much lower on the ground than a turret weapon, and thus have los blocked or cover given to sponson shots more often. You can of course move, but then you're either firing one gun or not shooting at all.\nDakka Pred doesn't mind any of this, because it's sponsons are cheap and doesn't suffer too much from cover being given to it's HB shots.\n\nRe: What is the point of autocannon heavy bolter predator ?\n\nagreed think of it this way if you pop the marines transport and they are in cover they are going to use their armor save. SO if we math this out\n6 s5 at BS 4 = 4 hits\ns5 on t 4 = 2.666667 wounds\n3+ save= 0.888888 dead in cover\n\nRe: What is the point of autocannon heavy bolter predator ?\n\nIts ok, but as the two weapons have different functions for the most part, you tend to be wasting the usefulness of the other weapon whatever you shoot at. Autocannon and heavy bolters are a lot cheaper and have a similar function, so its not as bad(they have more shots too which reduces the effect of any misses). What is the point of autocannon heavy bolter predator ?\n\nYeah, it doesn't make much sense. The lascannon turret is expensive, and is basically only efficient against heavy armor - but the heavy bolters are useless there. With an autocannon/heavy bolter combo you have a cheaper option and both guns work together - you specialize in putting wounds on infantry or suppressing light armor (rhinos/razorbacks, trukks, light speeders like vypers/rhinos/piranhas, anything DE etc).\n\nIf you want an anti-armor predator, consider having an autocannon with lascannon sponsors. The lascannons can punch through anything, and the autocannon works ok against most vehicles (as in, anything not AV 14)."}

Even a drake with a full set of HG Talons, two firewalls and an ECCM has a 44% chance to get jammed by 3 caldari jammers from a falcon.

If they want people to fight in huge gangs against POS or Outposts or more importantly each other and encourage this in the way they develop the game hardware should be there to support this and it isnt, that is the fault of CCP alone. Its like running software on a computer below the basic requirements for gameplay, yes it is normally possible but it hardly works smoothly.\n\nMy response on this to the topic starter is find another game. If more people did that, CCP would start feeling the pain in the wallet, where it really matters. I know the thread starters pain, I used to run missions out of \"The Citadel\", mostly Saila. CCP should be providing a lag-free gaming enviroment, but they do not, and they will not EVER do this because they are not feeling the pain of loosing customers. I will tell you this, the DEV's and GM's of this game care nothing about your problems and only about your making your monthly payments to CCP.

You knew that by going to a heavily populated system you will be exposing yourself to lag which may cause the loss of your ship and you being unable to respond to aggression. So being fully aware of that you still took your ship into a laggy system. Why? I think that in the first place it isn't CCP but you who should care more for your ships and accept the consequences of what you do with them. The game isn't perfect and yes currently a lot of people in same system cause lag. Either play around it and quit whining or quit the game (and give me all your stuff :P)."}
{"text": "Contest: Homeworld Plotholes (v0.2)\n\nThe previous thread being both moribund and very, very long, it's probably time to start afresh.\n\nSo, to open the batting, here's one from the second mission in Cataclysm. The Kuun-Lan's commanding officer mentions 'a dual signal on the emergency channel' that turns out to be from a drifting disaster beacon. Now, I can just about believe that it could stay mostly functional for a million years straight -with radio-electric decay by something with an extremely long half-life for a power source and really good workmanship it's just about possible- but doesn't it strike you as slightly unlikely that the Galactic Council has retained the same Interstellar Distress Frequency since before most of its current members left the oceans?\n\nGalactic council? Wasn't the Naggarok from outside the galaxy? And launched way before the galactic council was even formed? But the point still stands that they have the exact same emergency channel as the naggaroks creators. Maybe the beast organism infecting the probe was \"listening to the electromagnetic chatter of your tiny self/worlds.\" and configured it to send out signals on that frequency to get someone to come and pick it up.\n\nThat's a point actually; what did happen to the Naggarok's crew in the end? If they had time to trash the engines and radio transmitter badly enough that the Beast couldn't fix them without outside assistance, they could certainly have run like buggery for the lifeboats.\n\nMaybe, but I can't help wondering whether some of them got off the ship in time, and what happened to them if they did.\n\nI'm pretty sure they made a point not to leave as not to completely ruin the point of stranding the infection in space in case any got on the escape ship too.\n\nAlso, if the beast DID infect them it'd know how to jury rig a solution to repair its drives.\n\nIt can know how, but with no way of building or repairing and I assume no resources since those launch tubes looked like they worked but they never built anything (and presumably all the mutations and warping of the Beast Mothership's hull didn't come out of thin air) those parts it's out of luck until something comes along and repairs it for them.\n\nI'll be of little help *gasp shock horror* since this is Cataclysm territory and I never made it past the 'sneak through the dust clouds next to the Imperialist base' mission (and I don't have a working disc), so...\n\nI know that when the crew of the Naggarock disabled the engines, the hsip automatically jettisoned a distress beacon pod. Does it say in-game that the Naggarock even has escape pods? If not, to avoid infection they could have just killed themselves by opening an airlock into space.\n\nIs there any mention of escape pods on any ships in the Homeworld universe? Also, what's to say they didn't jettison any of these supposed pods around the same time they disabled the engine and ruined the com-arrays?\n\nSpace is also BIG. I don't know how large the Naggarock is in comparison to any of the other Homeworld ships, but the likelihood of someone picking up a Beast infected escape capsule that isn't functioning or transmitting a signal after a million years of stellar drift is impossibly low. Especially in a planetary system where the gravitational pull of planets could send the said pods into the crushing depths of a gas giant.\n\nI think it'd be a good idea to copy the first post of the old thread (along with the links) so that we wouldn't go through resolved things all over again. A moderator could 'Edit' it and copy it, so that you wouldn't have to relink everything, right?\n\n\"The Beast Cruise Missile was first seen in Seera Tel system, when a Kiith Manaan frigate squadron sent a frantic message that it was under attack by unknown drone craft. When no further word was received, Manaan Fleet Command sent in a full Carrier group to investigate, but initially all that was found was the wreckage of one Assault Frigate; the remaining four Ion Beam Frigates were nowhere to be found.\n\nEventually a lone escape pod was found with one alive-but-nearly-insane Manaani bridge officer aboard. When an psi-tech was finally able to piece her psyche back together again, the mystery was finally solved.\n\nIt seems that soon after issuing the report, the incoming drones closed at ramming speed too fast for the Ion Beam Frigates to track. As the drones impacted, it became obvious they were huge missiles carrying a warhead of Beast plasma; the missiles blew through the frigate's hull, the plasma warhead burst, and the infection spread through the ship in seconds, subverting the ship and dissolving her crew.\n\nThe battle took less than two minutes, as the three infected Ion Frigates turned on the one assault frigate that had managed to destroy the cruise missile targeted on it before impact. The lone surviving officer had been shoved into an escape pod by her captain, along with the battle telemetry; she was ejected moments before the last frigate was cut to pieces...\"\n\nIt's just something to keep the conversation going. We've talked about less in the past.\n\nThe Star-Metal scrolls were of deep religious significane to the Somtaaw, supposedly written by Jakuul (whoever that is) himself in a language no living man could read. It wasn't until the discovery of the Khar-Toba and the Guidestone that the scholars of Kharak started to be interested in the Scrolls, and other mythological artifacts (the Sobanni sword Caaliburnos, the Flaming Spear of Gaalsi and the Somtaaw's Chalice of Life) from the early days of Kharakian history. But, due to politics, they were never looked at by researchers and historians due to the BurningIt's obvious that they were important, but to think that if the Somtaaw hadn't been stubborn and put the world before themselves, the entire Homeworld War could have been avoided or at least made much less painful.\n\nHere's another one, if that's not suited enough to your liking.\n\nWhich is more powerful: Hyperspace, or Slipgates? They both open into hyperspace, but one is naturally occuring while the other is generated. However, only the Cores had the capabilities to jump the great distances that the Slipgates were said to do. And then there's the overcharged Bentusi Slipgate that they try to run away in.\n\nThe way Slipgates sound like they work is a hole in reality between two points, enter one end, get shot out the other. The Bentusi Slipgate had a natural exit vector outside of the galaxy and was artificially enhanced to shoot them far past that exit and into another galaxy. That makes the Eye of Arran look like a toy in comparison, which could only transport ships through a system of gates.\n\nAnd, one could go even further and say that Balcora was a overcharged Slipgate, with an exit hole at the Lagrange point between the supermassive black holes.\n\nNatural phenemenon are more powerful than what beings can create. However, the downside to this is that you can build a jumpgate anywhere that you want almost. Slipgates stable and large enough are few and far between. Also, there is the problem of finding where they leadAlternatively they could've just been scrolls that had been written and had nothing to do with the Khar-Toba or earlier, but no one knows because no one looked. That's not a plothole, though, just a mystery.\n\nI haven't fully read the thread but on the subject of the Crew of the Naggarok escaping. They probably figured that if the ship was infected so were any of the escape pods, vehicles, and other space-borne craft they may be able to use to escape with. That's my two cents there\n\nAye, I believe it was supposed to be an act of sacrifice for the greater good (tau?).\n\nI have a thought on....well, not really a plot-hole, more something that I'm surprised has never been addressed in fan-fic.\n\nUsing PDA's for mining and construction seems to be a method popular among the more savvy races, if not being the norm galaxywide. Far as we've been led to understand, they build up and break down target objects atom by atom.\n\nNow, given that quite a few capital ships have been stolen by most races at some point or another, what is to stop a thieving navy from using a PDA to create a bunch of copies to be used for false flag ops?\n\nOK, it'd be very illegal. But that doesn't always stop us in the real world, hmm?\n\nNot much point really; to achieve complete tactical surprise they'd have to crack the enemy's IFF codes ahead of time, and reconfigure the assembly line to fabricate a whole bunch of non-standard components and bolt them together."}
{"text": "Perhaps some monsters would be tagged as \"one-of-a-kind\", once they were placed, they would be removed from the list-- though there would be no guarantee that they will be placedGeoff the Medio wrote:\n\nWhat would be good to add now, IMO, is some benefit to players to having the monsters around. This could be similar to bonuses for killing barbarians in Civ games, but perhaps something more interesting could be arranged.\n\nIt might also be worth considering, if all of the space creatures should be monsters. Perhaps there could be some creatures that don`t attack the player, but instead do something positive when they move around. Like for example a creature that could temporarily speed up starlane travel in those areas that it has gone through recentlyIndeed, I think it is an important plus for replayability that the random stuff, monsters, species, & specials be unpredictable from game to game. But also since you can set the galaxy with a very small number of stars, there are certain to be at least sometimes random content that doesn't appear.\n\nI have been following the freeorion forums for a few years now, on and off, but I am highly interested in the space monster varieties, and their corresponding uniqueness.\n\nWould the importance of such a game aspect warrant a separate engine logic module, so that the ideas are not restricted to what can be done now, which, from the looks of it, is reasonably limited?\n\nI really liked Yakk's approach to the problem, and given a set of creatures, the map generator could randomly populate the galaxy with a unique set of critters.\n\nIdeally, it would be a level more interesting than the MOO2 random appearance of 2-3 creature types + monsters, and, given time, it should be possible to match the fauna growth to a normal empire growth of the player to hamper exponential growth of the empire later on in the game, especially in large galaxies with small number of players.\n\nWould you consider adding a wider range of abilities to the creatures, than traditional MOO1/2 set?\n\nFor example, extremely large creatures could feed on the planet's ecology, reducing gaia/terran planets down into tundras/swamps, and later on all the way to barren? Since it would take time for such a monster to grow, the player should have technology to terraform planets back to terran by the time such a monster would spawn.\n\nOverall, it would be interesting to see the space monsters as something other than a simple \"reach 6 MIRV nuke destroyers, get all planets\" type of obstacle for progress of the game, and more of a continuous resistance for your own expansion, which is matched by force, as the game progresses, effectively reducing the number of planets the player have to manage (since colonising new ones is nearly as hard as taking the other player's ones), and allowing for creation of flexible chokepoints on the map.\n\nThis could also add a whole unique set of research tech and auto-generated treasures, which rely on the space monsters, and their sizes.\n\nIn SVN we've got reproducing monsters, and scripting allows a lot of other arbitrary behaviors. The only significant thing we lack IMHO is the ability to make the monsters react to specific other ships or monsters.\n\nMonsters, IMHO give us a good chance to try development by iteration.\n\n1) improve monster scripting 2) playtest: find out experientially what works and what doesn't 3) go back to step 1\n\nMonsters are a simple enough segment of the game, that we don't really need a grand and integrated plan. And it saves a lot of work over discussing adopting a grand and complicated scheme like Yakk's, implementing code and script, and then discovering that it is overkill, or didn't work as hoped.\n\nFeel free to discuss ideas, or script your own monsters, but the most practical ideas will be about what the next step could be.\n\nThe only significant thing we lack IMHO is the ability to make the monsters react to specific other ships or monsters.\n\nThere is a Design condition in the SVN version that can test for particular ship designs (and thus specific types of ships or monsters). There are also conditions for part types or hull types or part classes.\n\nSo I was thinking about this while waiting for the doctor. I'm starting to understand how the effects work, but I'm still far from mastery.\n\nSo say we wanted to make tame space monsters, but not just let the player build them like ships once he had the plan/techOr maybe the eggs would hatch at a normal rate but the presence of a colony/outpost (and/or having a monster wrangling tech?)would make sure the resulting monster was on your side.\n\nGeoff the Medio wrote:\n\nThere is a Design condition in the SVN version that can test for particular ship designs (and thus specific types of ships or monsters).

Or it could occur on a predetermined game turn.). That, and if you wanted to only let the player raise one monster, that would be hard as well. don_________________ Warning: Antarans in dimensional portal are closer than they appear.\n\n...the only hard part about what you described would be making the original special spawn a monster after a certain amount of time...\n\nFor now i am content with X% chance of \"hatching\" per turn.\n\nBigjoe5 wrote: donUncontrolled space monsters on your side could be interesting, especially if they appeared to your enemies the same as \"wild\" monsters. But that is probably very forward-looking. User-controlled monsters are a fine for a start.\n\nThe big question is, \"why bother with raising monsters when you can build your own ships?\" I think we need to provide some sort of answer to that, besides \"um... monsters are cool!\"\n\nSome ideas:\n\nmonsters aren't \"built\" from minerals, but grow on their own monsters can reproduce (wild or tame progeny?) monsters can grow into stronger, bigger monsters by eating little monsters. monsters require no fuelIn MOO2, the space eel would reproduce itself (the outer space one, not default one that is spawned at a planet from the start).\n\nA number of actions I would love to see that the space monsters could do (including previously mentioned ones) :\n\nDegrade/Upgrade planet's biodiversity Degrade/Upgrade planet's mineral value (monster is always visible on the map, even if out of range) Degrade/Upgrade sun intensity, affecting biodiversity of all planets in the system (monster is always visible on the map, even if out of range) Turn suns into black holes / eat full planets / etc (monster is always visible on the map, even if out of range, global warning before the monster spawns, i.e. the egg is layed)\n\nNotes :: these supermonsters would present a direct and long-term dangers to any of the players on the map, if tuned correctly (egg spawns in small habitats rather than huge ones) this would lead to monster preferably spawning near strongest player (least monster habitat), while still likely causing a threat to others. This could lead to interesting events, up to the point of forcing players to declare peace to eradicate the threat, before continuing their assault. Requires quite a lot of logic to prevent the monster from simply rolling a single player, or not being a threat at all, other than destroying planets which could have been effectively colonised later in the game.\n\nAbility to spawn larger version of itself based on certain conditions :\n\nSuch as, eating a colony of a certain of higher population digesting sufficient number of space ships digesting a spaceship with a particular technology eating sufficient number of another type of monster staying in a certain habitat long enough (neutron stars/etc) Finding a correct type of planet with correct type of sun etc.\n\nNote :: all of these are advanced conditions to reduce likelihood of a supermonster spawning. They can also lead to other interesting effect, where a newly spawned monster, can be an advantageous trophy to capture/kill for a special research/bonus. Up to a point where the monster would alter the specie's genome?\n\nIll add more, once I sit down and do a proper write up and analysis... of course under the condition that I am not totally out with whatever I am suggesting.I don't know if we have a way to do that without making them an invincible force in the early game. Currently i don't see a way to make them randomly appear in the middle of the game.\n\nCommutor wrote:\n\nDegrade/Upgrade planet's biodiversity\n\nFO has no such concept.\n\nEFFECTS:\n\nOK, i'm trying to make space monsters do different things based on weather... 1) there are planet type X in the system 2) there are imperial (non-monster) ships in the system 3) there are specific monster hulls in system.\n\nUsually there is also a random probability. I've looked around for examples, and tried several things, but no luck.\n\nI'm not clear on what goes in \"scope =\" and what goes in \"activation =\".\n\nExamples please?Currently i don't see a way to make [monsters] randomly appear in the middle of the game.\n\nA special in planet_specials.txt would be randomly placed around the galaxy. Such a special could have a Turn condition in one of its effectsgroups, which would prevent something from happening until a certain number of turns has passed. After that condition is met, the special could start randomly spawning monsters.\n\nOr, a tech or building could have an effectsgroup that creates monsters, and this would start happening as soon as the tech or building is researched or produced by an empire.\n\nQuote:\n\n1) there are planet type X in the system\n\nYou should be able to do this with something like\n\nCode:\n\nAnd [ System Contains Planet type = Terran ]\n\nQuote:\n\n2) there are imperial (non-monster) ships in the system\n\nCode:\n\nAnd [ System Contains And [ Ship OwnedBy AnyEmpire ] ]\n\nQuote:\n\n3) there are specific monster hulls in system.\n\nCode:\n\nAnd [ System Contains DesignHasHull name = \"SH_EXAMPLE\" ]\n\nThose are all untested, but should give you the right idea.\n\nQuote:\n\nUsually there is also a random probability.\n\nCode:\n\nRandom probability = 0.5\n\nQuote: Evaluating a condition on just the source is a lot faster than doing so on everything in the universe, so it's useful to have the activation condition for things like turning on or off an effect depending on whether the empire that owns a building has a particular tech.\n\nThere are some misuses of activation in the current content files. The imperial palace has an activation that tries to test how many of a particular building an empire has, but this won't work, as only the source building for the effectsgroup will be tested, so at most 1 such building will be found by that condition.\n\nQuote:I expect you'd get 2 bigger krill swarms. The destroy effect doesn't actually delete objects until all other effects have executed. \"Executing\" the destroy effect just marks an object as to be destroyed, and the actual deleting takes place afterwards.\n\nSo, you'll need to be a bit fancier with the effectsgroup for things to work as you want with two objects being destroyed and just one being created. The MaximumNumberOf conditions might work, as you can ask it to match just one object, and then you could have a stacking group label in the effectsgroup as well, so even if both krill swarms have a CreateShip effect, only one will actually be executed (as the second attempt would see the stacking group label has already been applied to the target object, so it would be skipped). I don't seem to have documented MaximumNumberOf, MinimumNumberOf, or ModeNumberOf though...\n\nEdit: It would probably work to just use the NumberOf condition, which is documented on the wiki.\n\nOr, instead of having a single effectsgroup that creates a new monster and destroys the old ones, you could have two effects groups: one would match a type of monsters when there are two of the monster in the same system, and would destroy the matched monsters. The other would test for systems that contain two of the monster, and would create a new monster in those systems, and would have a stacking group. This effectsgroup would be tested for every moster of the relevant type every turn, which might be a bit slow, but it would only act at most once per system per turn due to the stacking group, and would probably be easier to understand than using the SortedNumberOf condition. /Edit\n\nQuote:\n\nAlso: what does \"location=\" do in a ship hull?\n\nIt is used by the production system to determine where a ship with that hull can be produced. For example, it could require a particular building to be present on a planet for a ship to be built there.\n\nSo are the above untested snippets for the source or activation?Habitability of a planet of a given environment is dependent solely on the species inhabiting it. A species whose EP is Barren would be best friends with the gigantic goo-spewing monster in question (not that that's a bad thing).\n\neleazar wroteWhat I think you're looking for is something like:\n\nCode:\n\nactivation = ContainedBy Contains Planet type = Asteroids\n\nThis will test the source object to see if its in the same system as an Asteroid Belt. Or, you could do something like:\n\nCode:\n\nscope = And [ Source ContainedBy Contains Planet type = Asteroids ]\n\nwhich should do exactly the same thing, since after the scope has been narrowed to Source, it's basically just checking to see if the Source is also in a system with Asteroids"}

Just for the hell of it!\n\nDidn't they have a cross formation for fighter groups in Homeworld?\nThe only real problem in Homeworld in regards to the full usage of 3d space was the fact that you couldn't really physically position your ships however you liked. I remember in HW2, in the mission where you're attacking a Space Station held by the Vaygr, in which I sent my entire fleet far above the station in order to evade the brunt of the enemy defenses.\nHowever, when I issued the attack order, my ship just sort of descended \"down\" towards the target with their \"bottoms\" still facing \"down\", which made it seem a bit silly.\n\nChavez said: I'd say it's best seen as combat between submarines that are in plain sight of each other. A single hit will rip the ship apart.\n\nBut in space, you might not be in plain sight, and even if you see the enemy, he might not be at the same spot once your shots arrive at the target area.\nWhether or not the ships are ripped apart also obviously depends on the armour and the power of the weapons used.\n\nThe single most important thing in space battles would likely be intelligence. Whether that means spies within the enemy military or drones and listening posts, you would need to know within reasonable accuracy where and when the enemy would appear before even moving out.\nOf course, that would obviously be influenced by the orbit physics as mentioned in the article and obviously the locations of points of interest, mining facilities, colonies, planets or space stations. But even so, in a desperate war, you might always have enemies movin from completely unexpected directions only to surprise you even if there aren't many strategic targets there.\n\nAnd of course, stealth. Jamming the enemy sensors or hiding in asteroid belts while launching AI controlled drone fighters that double as missiles would be a splendid tactic.\nSo I'd imagine that if there were to be any space warfare, you'd end up with a small number of large baseships carrying a large number of drones to create a sphere of surveillance and offense/defense while trying to conceal themselves as best as possible, only emerging from hiding to strike the finishing blows with lasers or something.\n\nBeatnik said: IThe solar system is not completely a dish though. Only the sun and major planets operate on one plane, but comets and semi-planets (whatever you call those smaller planets since the reclassification of planets in 2006, Plutoids?) do not necessarily do so.

{"text": "I have no idea what \"ore radius\" is, but if you mean \"ore volume\", then every ore has its own translation ration. But you don't need to translate ore volume into units, really. The mining laser is calibrated in volume per cycle, so just translate volume into isks directly.\n\nI've been looking for that formula for years, and honestly, I don't think there is a straight forward, radiusX = Yunitsofore formula. You can only get within \"close\" approximation, and then even that isn't always reliable.\n\nAt one time I created a lookup table of radius' and units of scanned pyrox. I couldn't get a significant consistency to come up with a forumla reliable enough to say for sure how much ore was in the roid.\n\nDont want to sound harsh...but radius is the line extending from the centre of a circle (or other object) to the outer edge\n\nYou do know that the radius of an asteroid decreases while you mine it, right?\n\nThe OP wants to check the amount of ore in the roid without using the survey scanner just by looking at the roid's radius.\n\nFor sure the different roids have different amounts as they have different initial sizes.\n\nIf anyone knows the formula let me know, I look for it also.\n\nEDIT: Well not exactly the radius. It remains the same no metter how much ore is in it. There is also a \"Size\" column in the overview which is different for the roids of same type. People were using it to estimte what is left in the roid. Lately this value don't change also. At least for me.<nerd>\n\nYou're assuming that the Asteroid is completely Veldspar (or other ore). Much more likely that it's a heterogeneous mixture of Veldspar and other unusable rock/metals and that the mining lasers are designed to target the veins of Veldspar in the otherwise unusable rock. So from that 4.186 x 10^6 m^3, maybe only 200,000 is actually Veldspar. Hence why we here \"Asteroid Depleted\" and it being a \"Shattered hulk\" than \"Asteroid Consumed\"... Then again, the Asteroid does disappear when you're done."}

{"text": "TOE is \"Table of Organization and Equipment\" and is one of the documents stating how a military force is to be organized. How many planes, how many pilots, how many people in the ground crew, and on and on and on. In a bit I'll try and dig up some examples and post a link. Questions like \"What does CAG stand for\" and \"What's the CIC\" are what this is for.\n\nSince two such question have come up in rapid succession, I'll answer them here, and then leave off:\n\nThe CIC is the combat information center, it is the room in which information about the battle is collected, and it is a principle place from which any battle will be directed; on BG it seems to also include the functions of a ships bridge, which is the location from which a ship is driven. This strikes me as very reasonable for a ship in space.\n\nCAG stands for Commander Air Group. While the Colonial the Colonial Fleet TOE (Table of Orginization and Equipment) remains a deep, dark mystery which we might hope to solve here, in Western navies (which BG more than a little resembles) the CAG commands the embarked air wing, and is a peer of (rather than subordinate too) the skipper of the carrier.\n\n[Edited to add: Strega, is there anyway you, or someone else, can fix that \"your\"? Sorry. Homonyms are my natural predator]\n\nDone. I made it \"BG TOE\" so it wouldn't be quite so long. Plus, it's rhyme-y.\n\nOn the show, the XO seems to be sort of a mediator in military decisions affecting both the air wing and the carrier -- which it seems like you'd need, but what do I know? Does that correspond to the modern navy? Or am I imagining the whole thing?\n\nThere's a great resourse availble on understanding how a USN carrier battle-group is organized at  . It's a little dated but it gets the high points, written for Reserve Officers reporting on-board for their duty-tours. It even has ship-board etiquette and what-to-pack.\n\nCurrent USN military doctrine has the Carrier's Captain and the CAG as co-equals reporting to the strike-force's commanding Admiral. The Carrier XO (usually of the rank of Captain) runs the ship-side of the day-to-day operations.\n\nWe've also met the Landing Signal Officer (LSO). In the miniseries his name was Captain Kelly. He's the guy who was questioning Adama about Tigh's fitness for command.\n\nLike the CAG, this also is a real wet-navy position.\n\nAlso, as far as CIC goes, (reasonably minor spoiler follows)in a later episode there's a scene where Adama and company, in the midst of a battle, clearly change rooms between one with tactical displays and another where they give the ship movement commands. This seems to argue that there's either a CIC, or at least a battle briefing room of some type which is somewhat seperate from the bridge.\n\nI thought I caught railroad tracks on the back of Starbuck's helmet during \"Bastile Day\", just as a data point. Maybe they're some kind of integrated service, kind of like the Candian Forces?\n\nCould be. The odd mix of army-style and navy-style ranks could be a result of Joint doctrine gone horribly wrong, resulting in a unified rank structure designed to confuse everyone (grin).\n\nWhat we desparately need from the show's PTB is a table of rank insignia. Well, I deparately need one. I have a thing for rank tables. Ahem.\n\nI had typed a lot more, but I found myself going in circles trying to figure out how a Commander can outrank a Colonel, and gave up. At least one other Marine had those two white bars on his helmet, by the way.\n\nHelo who's stuck on Caprica referred to himself to Boomer as her ECO which I think means Electronic Combat Officer since he ran some controls in the back of the Raptor. Either that or it could be Equipment Control Officer.\n\nWhat we desparately need from the show's PTB is a table of rank insignia. Well, I deparately need one. I have a thing for rank tables. Ahem.\n\nThe odd mix of army-style and navy-style ranks could be a result of Joint doctrine gone horribly wrong, resulting in a unified rank structure designed to confuse everyone (grin).\n\nI'll buy that. I have a tough enough time trying to keep the Army and Air Force acronyms straight at the Pentagon...\n\nMaybe Galactica is a combination of an aircraft carrier and amphibious assault ship - more analogous to what the USN and USMC are doing with the Expeditionary Strike Group concept: \n\nThe ship certainly looks large enough to carry both her fighter wing and troops, and the hints at unrest on Sagittarion (President 'Stands with Dri-Erase Marker' mentioned President Adar sending in the Marines at the end of \"33\") certainly indicate a need for some sort of assault capability for the Colonial Navy.\n\nA word or acronym I've heard a few times on BG is pronounced something like \"draedus\". It appears to be referencing thair radar-like system. Anyone know what the word actually is, and what it refers to?\n\nThanks for this! I'd sort of had CIC figured out, but the whole might-also-just-be-the-bridge thing had me confused. But since it's all still sort of a combat situation anyway, it makes more sense to me now that I look at it. Man, as if I ever needed reason #865 not to join the military, it would be my complete inability to be down with rank, protocol, and acronymns/abbreviations.\n\nI think the thing with the CIC is that it would (as far as I can make out) be used primarily when leading a Battlestar Group into battle. Since the Galactica doesn't have a carrier group anymore (unless, you know, Adama wants to start issuing orders like \"Astral Queen, you fly up to the Cylons, go boogedy boogedy boo, and run away real fast\") and really just needs to direct itself, the bridge is pretty much all they need.\n\nIt's their sensor/radar type system, right? At first I thought it was the name of a ship, but every ship seems to have a dradis (DRADIS?). It seems like it must be an acronym, but I have no idea what for.\n\nGlobalSecurity.Org has the same problems we do with how things are \"organized\".\n\n\"... Land lubbers accustomed to the admirable clarity of the organization of the United States Air Force, or the slight quirkiness of the organization of the United States Army, will be quickly alarmed and bewildered by what claims to pass for the \"organization\" of the United States Navy. Indeed, those not of a naval persuasion may be surprised to learn that the Navy is \"organized\" at all, in that units intermediate between numbered fleets and individual ships so rarely figure in public accounts of naval activities. And the more that one learns of US Navy \"organization\" the less it is understood, given the bizarre diversity and inconsistency of unit designations. One source of this confusion is the distinction between tactical and administrative chains of command, while additional obscurity derives from individual commanders wearing multiple hats in various chains of command. \"\n\nThis topic should be fun.....\n\nDRAEDUS might be a deep-space version of the USN's AEGIS radar-aircombat system. (Hint: AEGIS is not an DoD acronym. Aegis was the armored-cloak worn by Zues and Athena, spun of Gold in the form of a goatskin, with the Gorgon's head as it's clasp.)\n\nAnyway, with all BG's pseudo-Greek mythology allusions, it wouldn't surprise me had they used \"AEGIS\" for such a thing, particularly when there's already a real world counterpart. So I'd assumed that \"dradis\" was something else.\n\nAccording to the official website, the officer ranks in the Colonial fleet are: Ensign, Lieutenant j.g., Lieutenant, Captain, Colonel, Commander, Admiral. There are also Colonial Marines, but their rank structure is unknown (they have not as yet appeared onscreen).\n\nAccording to the official website, the officer ranks in the Colonial fleet are: Ensign, Lieutenant j.g., Lieutenant, Captain, Colonel, Commander, Admiral. There are also Colonial Marines, but their rank structure is unknown\n\nThere aren't any colonels or majors in the USN. It goes ensign, j.g., lieutenant, lt. commander, commander, captain, then admirals.\n\nWe can't really put this on Ron Moore and company either. The ranks were very central to the original show, and while they dumped a lot of the baggage of the original, I think they felt it somewhat essential to keep Adama as a \"Commander\", because it had become somewhat emblematic to call him that. From that I suppose it made sense to keep Tigh as a Colonel and so on, because that use of \"Commander\" was already nonsense. Glen A. Larson is to blame! Yup!\n\nAnd actually \"Major\" does seem to have gotten lost. I mean Glen Larson was already pilfering multiple military services, so I wonder why \"Major\" got the boot.\n\nIf the quote about the rank structure pans out, then the two bars on Starbuck's helmet were indeed the correct rank, if the Colonials use US Navy tactical insignia (a variant of the \"brass\" insignia they wear on the khaki uniform collar. Which is the same as the other services' regular insignia, but completely different from the stripe-based insignia on the dress blue uniform sleeves, thus requiring each sailor to memorize two different insignia for each officer rank. It's not just a job, it's a giant headache). Or it could have been a coincidence.\n\nAnd actually \"Major\" does seem to have gotten lost. ...so I wonder why \"Major\" got the boot.\n\nThere's a military joke there somewhere, but I can't quite think of it. Anyway, could the doctor be a Marine doctor? Maybe the Marines have Majors. The Navy probably got rid of it (assuming for the moment that the list above is complete) to avoid things like \"Major Payne\" or \"Major Major.\"\n\nMy gut feeling is that DRADIS is just RADAR spelled sideways. There are a number of little things about the show that send the message, \"They're just like us, only different.\" Instead of RADAR they have DRADIS. Instead of radio, they have wireless. Instead of \"november\" and \"charlie,\" they have \"nebula\" and \"constellation.\" Instead of \"mayday\" they have \"crypter.\"\n\n(I'm not saying that DRADIS works just like RADAR only with a different name. The inner workings could depend on modulated neutrino emissions or Einstein-Rosen particle pairs or the moral power of virginity for all I know. I'm just saying that our word for \"machine that sees far for us\" is \"RADAR\" while their word for the same thing is \"DRADIS.\")\n\nA small nitpick but we use the term wireless for radio as well. Though admittedly it's not incredibly common. Also, given how they've been treating the communication equipment on the ships (one way telegram-like communications over long distances, voice coms over short, and no communication after jumping away from the fleet) it looks very much like they're trying to be consistent with using a lightspeed limited electro-magnetic wave for communication.\n\nIn \"Act of Contrition\" Apollo says he's got 40 surviving Vipers (and 21 pilots). Does that fit into the context of this thread (which seems to be about military organization)?\n\nAlso in the episode, Starbuck makes references to LSOs (during her story about Cmdr. Adama's 1,000 landing) and meatballs (when trying to help the nugget land). The former presumably stands for Landing Signal Officer (as the one who would guide the Vipers to a safe landing) and meatballs as the signal that Vipers follow to the landing area. Seems pretty conforming to U.S. Navy stuff to me."}
{"text": "[The Homeworld condition] only counts as homeworlds the origin of imperial/playable species. Is that correct?\n\nI think it should match planets on which player-controlled empires start the game. I'm not sure whether it would match planets on which playable species start if they start as natives, though I suspect it would not. It won't match planest on which non-playable species start. Some of this could be changed, if desired, though., and not for the homeworld test to be completely redundant if archives are present.

It means that 75% (or whatever is 1 - native_chance), the game skips the planet without attempting to add a species. If a planet does pass the chance test, then it finds all suitable species (good environment) for the planet and randomly picks one. If no species are suitable for the planet, it should skip the planet.\n\nQuote:\n\nI'm wondering what exactly it would take to put a unique species on each native world with max settings.\n\nYeah.

Since about 10% of the galaxy is probably uninhabitable Gas giants or asteroids, and 1 out of 4 planets with natives is IMHO sufficient, if not excessive, so i'll round it off and say I'll want to eventually have 1000 unique icons. Or 8 times the current number.

{"text": "During the discussion of the game play mode, there was a question about how the players would reside in the galaxy, how they would colonize planets, and how many planets he could colonize. Many browser-based games allow you to colonize an entire planet and you are given a limited number of building 'fields' to work withA bigger unexplored universe What if we gave players a bigger universe - explored and unexplored - to live in, while making inhabited planets adequately 'crowded' as if you lived in the universe of Star Trek or Star Wars. Players would reside or visit a number of inhabited installations in the game. The general idea is for a multitude of players to be able to coexist in a location such as a planet, orbital facility, base, outpost even exceptionally large ships at the same time. If say, 1,000 players could reside on a large planet, you could produce truly unique systems with planets that are not the same from system to system, and would allow players to travel more, and visit other places besides their own home planets.\n\nLocal Economies With a planet that has a heavier population, it could provide a working infrastructure and economy, since not all players want to do all occupations. A planet would employ miners, merchants, shipyards, space ports, factories, research facilities, outfitting yards, bars, planetary defenses, and possibly a local government. This way everyone works together and the player can do what each enjoys the most.\n\nEach player could be given a piece of land on the planet to build what he pleases. This land could be limited, but he might also be able to purchase multiple lots on the planet. The player would also have the ability to own lots on multiple planets or facilities.\n\nSolar systems would be unique in nature, some solar systems may be nearly empty, with only a couple of orbiting planets, others might not have any habitable planets, and other solar systems may have a bountiful resource planet, or several M-class planets. The possibilities are endless.\n\nConquering Settlements Bases and planets could be conquered by a warring alliance if all of the planets defenses are subdued, and the attacking force has the required manpower to effectively take over the base or planet. An attacking force may also lay siege to the base, intruding a whole new series of strategies.\n\nColonization Colonization would require a group of individuals to collaborate on a colonization effort to make it successful. A planet could construct colonization ships that could be used in the effort to colonize new worlds. Which could then be built up.\n\nBuilding Space Stations and Outposts Building space stations would require a significant amount of resources from all of the players involved in the building project. Deep Space Outposts or listening posts could also be built, and would require mobile building platforms - and a significant amount of resources, depending on the size - to build the base. The bases would then be owned by the builders, and could space could be rented out or sold to other playersWRONG You're missing the part when HOW and WHERE depends only on our own ideas and immagination. We can create a system that puts so many random elements, and so many different types of planets/asteroid belts/etc., that eaven with 250000 solar systems in the wole game we really CAN make every single one of those unique and still have a lot of empty space to explore. Let me give You an example of a possible solution to that issue:\n\nWe have a 2 dimentional universe map with stars appearing there just as \"dots\" or different sizes of \"circles\". Every solar system would be generated randomly when first visited and saved in the database (so our database grows bigger every time some system is explored for the first time). That doesnt sound really revolutionary, right? Now let's add some additional elements to that idea:\n\nEvery solar system has 10 slots (or 15 or 8 or whatever we want it to be, that's not important at the moment)\n\nEvery generating of a system is an algorythm with several steps:\n\nA random number from 1 to \"max slots\" ie generated. That is our number of objects on the system.\n\nA random position is selected for every generated object in between position 1 and \"max slots\". As an effect we get a solar system with unknown number of planets on unknown positions.\n\nFor each object there is \"class\" selection, which is just a logical variable selected randomly (0 or 1), where 0 is an \"uninhabitable object\" and 1 is \"inhabitable\".\n\nFINAL PHASE: Every uninhabitable and inhabitable object is now selected randomly from the table containing exact objects of each type. In that table we have planets of various types, asteroid belt, giant planetoids and other special objects.\n\nAdditional objects: this step is not necesairy, but i think it's a nice idea to. A random number is generated from 0 to 3, which indicates the number of \"specials\" in the system like comets, alien ship wrecks or gas clouds.\n\nSo tell me, does that sound interesting? Now let's estimate how many possible combinations there are (i will use 10 as a default number of slots, object types and so on, because it's easyer): - We have 10 types of solar systems (with 1, 2, 3 ... 10 objects). - There are 10 types of habitable and 10 of uninhabitable objects. - Many objects can also have their own moons (the number depends on the object), but max could be liek 10 moons for a Brown Dwarf class superplanet - Remember that all of them can be located on different positions in the same system type (5 planet systems can look in ~300 ways)\n\nSimple multiplying 10*10*2(2 i think is the average number of moons including gas giants and superplanets)*500(possible layouts, propably there's more but i was to lazy to calculate that)*3^3(specials) ... 900 000 possible combinations. Of course many of them can look really similar, some may be generated exactly the same just because it;s random, but hey! ... we have a unique galaxy with high possibility to generate systems wit 0 inhabitable planets!\n\nSo now ... is it possible or not to kae every of those 250 000 (or more) solat systems unique ?\n\n Plus, you end up with a crowded universe rather than just crowded planets.\n\ni know im fairly new around here but i have extensive programming knowledge outside php unfortunately and this is an extremely interesting subject for me. i have actually started one of these before as i played a couple online way too much and wanted more. i left the group who began it as time got away from me with school and work that innevitably led to it not passing initial development but it would be fun to see one starting from scratch again.\n\nthis topic is a similar discussion we had and one of the things we thought we could use to differientiate the game from others. it is all along similar ideas as you present here and the basic thoughts were as follows:, very simplistic in nature unlike the previous guy though so give me some slack\n\nanyways, (lots of sharp edges but smoothing it out is the fun part) here is the rough idea you start with standard planetary systems with multiple planets to be colonized based on size but these planet sizes would result in multiple regions on the planet that could be colonized by multiple, different players\n\nie planet size 500 gives it 5 regions, 300 only 3...then each would have space to build totaling the size but a random size to each region. so region one might have 75, region two 150, etc...\n\nthen the planets could be colonized by more than one player as long as a) there are no planetary defenses or b) half of the planet is built on and make these feats that cant be done quickly. you could also invite allies to free regions or something.\n\nthis sort of layout could give the game another level of play too which would be land battles. everyone is used to going strait to spaceship fighting in the space game but what if you had to earn the ability to fly in space first? in the mean time you explore and colonize other land regions on your planet until you research/discover/build something to give you space flight tech.\n\nyour economy and career oritented design would simply take this idea one step further and while i understand your wanting to make it more than just a fighting game, this innevitably plays a role and would fit right in. lots of things to do on the planet besides fight would be a great addition.\n\nwith a format like this would force you to start people on the same planet to get early interaction but this could actually be beneficial as you can define a small system in the game and db until more people start playing and until they can actually explore space. i know you mentioned inhabiteted unexplored regions with what i would assume to be AI areas but starting galaxy 1-4 for example like others do could provide this type of set up and these unexplored galaxies could come into play late in game.\n\nmake sense? i dont know...just an idea we had and it seemed like this would fit in with what you were thinking here but if im way off base then...ok, just throwing it out there...good luck with this, i look forward to playing it!\n\nHighway of Life wrote:Highway of Life wrote: ... Plus, you end up with a crowded universe rather than just crowded planets.\n\nHighway of Life wrote:\n\n250 000 players depending on the system we take can be located in 250 000 solar systems or in 150 000, or 80 000 ... why shouldn't we make it possible to place more than one player in a solar system? Of course that system would require additional algorythms that would keep the area not really that overcrowded. On the other hand if You want to put so many players on one planet, than we don't really need any spaceships we need takns! we need a lot of tanks and infantry !\n\nMy point is, that we seem to have different definition of something being \"crowded\" or not ... for me crowd means a LOT of players in only one spot/one planet. Making people scattered in the whole universe makes it really NOT crowded at all, and many solar systems coesn't limit expansion at all ... because one race colonised every single planet it could in a solar system that doesn't mean the system is already full ... it only means that other planets in that system couldnt be colonised by them, but still can be by others. Spi21s idea with 5 or 3 regions on one planet is pretty much closer to the idea of multiple players in one system, but on seperate planets, than to the idea where 100 or 50 players are stuck on only one planet like sardines in a can\n\nAs a player i would be really confused just by the numbers ... how is it supposed to be simple and easy to use? That would be much more harder than browsing galaxy in Ogame or SFC. You have some solar systems that are inhabited, in every system there are several planets, and on a planet there are several players ... isn't tha one of the things we want to avoid? A really copmplicated element?\n\nKfarcyk wrote:I suspect you would need at least 8 inhabitable planets within each solar system. - If each player could colonize about 8 or 9 worlds (for example).\n\nRandom/Unique Solar Systems First off, I want to clarify that I agree with you on creating truly random and unique solar systems. My argument is that if a single player could colonize entire worlds, your options for uniqueness could be somewhat limited -- even though the order and quantity in which celestial bodies would appear would differ from system to system. My idea for planetary occupation would not limit exploration or unknown space, although it very likely could increase the amount of unknown or unexplored space regardless of the number of players who play the game.\n\nFeeling Crowded In a game of outer space and exploration, it would feel too crowded because of some 300,000 solar systems being already occupied. If there were fewer solar systems already occupied, it leaves a lot more room for space exploration.\n\nYes, the planets themselves would feel crowded, but I think this is more realistic. Think of cities on Earth. If the population of New York City (8 million) was spread out over the United States (nearly 10 million kilometers), so that each person in New York City (metro area) were given 1 square kilometer (their own 'planet'), all the sudden, you have a pretty crowded United States. But each square kilometer is not crowded. It's lonely, it only has one person on it. Cities are crowded. Planets are crowded. Outer space is not crowded. When you bring in a factor of realism, crowded planets are more realistic. Crowded galaxy is not.\n\n50 players one one planet is a very VERY small planet, a very small city, and certainly a very small town. Although I'm not against doing a limited number of regions, 3, 5, 10... whatever. I think more players to a planet would still be more realistic.\n\nOur Solar System LetsYou Control Your Land IfYour ability to control your own land, own multiple plots of land on multiple worlds, would not be hindered. You would still have control over what you build, but instead of the player being an entire civilization, you are instead a captain, a leader, an emperor, or whatever you want to be. And you don't occupy entire planets all by yourself - although you could own them, usurp them, or rule them.\n\nConfused by the Numbers You, as a player, should not care about the numbers. Because in the game, it doesn't matter to you. It only matters to the developers. People would likely choose a larger friendly crowd (a more populated planet of their own race and alliance) rather than a sparse hostile crowd. Having a higher player count on the planet could dramatically increase the player interactions in the game, which is one of our goals. The game interface just has to be simple, the game learning curve for the player cannot be complicated. But the game itself for the developers, can be as complicated as it needs to be. (why did i bring this up? because one player per planet is also so not realistic. ). Besides we can add different objects to the game, that would be interesting ... we could eaven add some clearly theoretical elements like stars orbiting black holes, or protoplanetary discs (that's not a theory ), we could also add randomly found planets without suns (there is a theory that \"solar systems\" are a lot more common than we think, but the central object never gets massive enough to start nuclear fusion of any elements and as an effect also to become a sun (or at least a brown dwarf), so it remains a dead and cold system of horribly cold planets orbiting a \"back sun\" that is sometimes only few times more massive than our Jupiter). I know that a bigger database would take longer to load etc., but since nobody is able to wiev more than a cuple of systems away (+allied line of sight) that shouldnt be a problem.\n\nAnyway with 250 000 players it would leave a LOT of space to explore if only we would have made it a lot more systems ... actually if every solar system (or \"something else\") would be generated randomly and added to the database on the discovery, there could be from 100 000 or 10 000 000 ponts on the map depending only on the players activity and how stron would their explorers insting be , what makes it impossible to explore and explore and explore more? I'll tell You ... not the star count, because there can be NO limits at all, but a limited immagination. We would only have to figure out a good system to locate players in the galaxy in a way that would maximize the space able to be explored. That's all\n\nLetsOk, but what if there are moons with atmosphere dense enough to breathe by some races? What if there is a race that needs no atmosphere? That's once again only a matter of our immagination, and using OUR sun as an example is pointless. Why? Becaause our sun is relatively one of the smaller suns in the galaxy. A lot of suns are much more massive, brighter and just bigger. In other words: there is a high possibility that more than 10 planets or maybe 15 is pretty common in the universe.\n\nNow only using OUR solar system as an example there are 8 planets : 2 capable to be colonised by \"human like race\". 2 extremely hot to be colonised by an alien race that can adapt to the conditions. 2 ice planets to be used by another alien race, And let's say 6 to 8 moons that are big enough to be colonised by a robotic race that does not need any atmosphere or sunlight. That makes 12 to 14 spots where an alien race can start it's colonisation (human are aliens for all that they call aliens themselves, right ? ). That's not realistic? That's very realistic, and almost every scientist working on possible aliens and their typed will tell You: a chance that an alien race develops on a similar planet and evolwes into a race anyhow close to human race is EXTREMELY LOW.100 to 200 players ? I'm not sure if thats not to much anyway. It would be pretty much like starting multiple game servers for the same game, that takes place on a single planet. I fear that 90% of the games trade and social life would end up in only one planet, or max in one solar system. Other solar systems would NEVER really interact because there would be so many players in one, that multiple wars would take place ony in that single solar system keeping everyone busy. I fear that it would just kill the whole traveling aspect of the game, because nobody would really move ... what for? All his enemies and alies are on just 2 planets ... why a player like that would ever move? Yeah ... he would send a fleet or two to get more exp and find alien techs, but everything else would be on that single one planet.\n\nIfReally ? We don't need to set any upper limit to make players occupy nax 5 or 6 planets. This could be limited by slowly growing levels. First levels are obtained quickly, but after a while it gets harder and hader. It works like that: If a players main planet is lvl 1 it can't rule any colonies, if it has a lvl of 2 it can controll one colony, lvl of 4 is 2 colonies, lvl 8 for 3 colonies , lvl 16 for 4 colonies, lvl 32, lvl 64 ... in theory every player can get up to 100 or 1000 colonies, but how long would he jave to play? 20 years? 50 years?\n\nDavid: i know thats a bit different form the fleet idea, but it's purpose is the same ... limiting without limits\n\nI agree with David in that, instead of having hundreds of thousands of populated star systems, the more we reduce that number the better. Then we can have a universe of endless size, but with only a handful of populated star systems, it will make the galaxy feel very unexplored. Even if we have 10 million players, at 100 players per planet, that's 100,000 planets; and at 8 planets per star systems, that's 12,500 star systems as opposed to the 1,250,000 star systems we would require if each of the 10 million players owned an entire planet.\n\nAnother issue of 1 player per planet is that, once a lot of players are accumulated, everybody will become very scattered, which will be a severe disadvantage were we to include storylines. (That's a subject for a different discussion.)"}

If I get things in Zenith caches or ARS, I'll take those but otherwise I won't use anything the Spire wouldn't have. The human triangle ships will only be used on defense, since it'd be a bit too challenging to only use Spire ships.\n\nI've got some stuff on, most importantly Dyson+Hybrids (Never been able to see this combo in action), Fallen Spire, Medium Golems+Spirecraft (The medium versions I find more fun).\n\nRedoing the actual game with Kieth's Seed.\n\nkeith.lamothe:\nInteresting :) I had been kinda thinking about this too.\n\nIt would mean starting over, but if there's a particular combo of bonus types you want from adjacent homeworlds, I can probably find a seed.

{"text": "So would you suggest that their damage go down some? Their fire rate go down some (aka. their reload time go up some)? Their range go down some? Their health go down some? Or their speed go down some (to reduce how well they can kite)? Or some combination of the above?\n\nAlthough keeping things together is very useful, sometimes you need that speed. Maybe you can instead group move only some of your faster ships (like speed 40ish and up?) together after the bombards. That way, there still is a blob that is harder to pick off, but not one quite so agonizingly slow (18 speed won't always cut it). Artillery ships, by their nature, are excellent on defense. And units that are great on defense will sometimes need a bit a micro to take care of them, because you don't have much of an advantage when you first pop in otherwise.\n\nAnd, as I stated before, you can abuse bombards in a similar way when using them for defense on your planets (except for the more than ship cap part, of course)\n\nThough, come to think of it, the AI seems to get above ship caps of low ship cap units very quickly. Are you sure the scaling of ship caps and reinforcement multipliers is working right? Sure, the AI gets bombards at a much slower rate than they get, say, fighters, but it still doesn't seem slow enough for their low ship cap. (of course, that could just me being annoyed, and the system is actually working just fine)\n\nIf you group move all your units together its like you make a fortress (without the range). They have tons of health and firepower but move slow. Bombards in ancient times were fortress killers.\n\nI don't see how you can't group move your faster units, bombers and fighters for example, and have them go out and kill the bombards. Your group move is being slowed by your own artillary units. If you send your fast units directly to the bombards, you will start killing them before the second shot. And remember, they come at 1/4 (?) of the caps of triangle ships. So they need to kill four times as many units to equalize on caps. That means a minimal of four shots, 2 minutes. That is enough to decide most battles on way or another.\n\nMain issue with chasing bombards is that you are waking up whatever toys are next to them with their guard post. I will try to chase them with fighters/bombers only and chameleons I have for bonus. Armor boosters I have as bonus don't really fare to well even in a fleet blob and their speed is not exactly stellar.\n\nFew times I tried to chase them with bombers.. I ended up without bombers.\n\nSame kind of reason why you likely won't ever see a Dwarf Fortress 2 -- why would you? Dwarf Fortress itself has never stopped growing, etc.\n\nThere already is a Dwarf Fortress 2, in a way at least. The Dwarf Fortress that everyone talks about is officially labeled, Slaves to Armok: God of Blood, Chapter II: Dwarf Fortress. Meaning that is officially Volume 2 in it series.\n\nSuper nitpick: No, the current Dwarf Fortress is the first Dwarf Fortress, while it is the second \"Slaves to Armok\" game. So to be quite frank, the series is called \"Slaves to Armok\" and hence \"Dwarf Fortress\" is \"Slaves to Armok 2\". Confusing? Yeah....stupid? Yeah. Dwarfy? Hell yeah!\n\nLogged\n\nClick here to get started with Mantis for Suggestions and Bug Reports.\n\nNot really. Either just swarm the system with high cap ships to effect target saturation, or use infinite engine health ships, OR use ships with enough range to not need a lot of moving. Or just drive a hive golem in and let the wasps take care of everything\n\nTrue. I had been thinking \"neuter planet on path to something I want, without spending AIP\", and running reinforcements through would be a pain thanks to the spider. But with human warp gates that's less of an issue, too.Nope, most guard posts do not have Antimatter bomb immunity. They have radar dampening instead.\n\nNow most forcefields and a very few select guard posts have antimatter bomb immunity.\n\nBut yea, I would support giving transports antimatter bomb immunity, for similar reasons that fortresses have a .005 multiplier on them. Or possibly make bombards have a .05 (or something) multiplier on Scout hulls, which would also fix this annoyance.\n\nI don't see the need to fiddle around with bombards. I have both fought against and played with them and I think they're good as they are now. Yes, they are annoying in AI hands but there are plenty of ways to deal with that. And they're lethal in player hands. Playing with them in my current 7/7 game. I have a full cap of mk I - Mk IV which means exactly 40 bombards (low caps) and they obliterate anything. 60 incoming maws? who cares, they'll be dead long before they reach me, long before they can even start chewing on me. When going on an attack, move the rest of your fleet in first, bombards about a second after so they won't waste shots on enemy ships near the wormhole. The enemy will then most likely order it's ships to abandon their guard posts and attack. A LOT of them die before they get even near my ships. Very useful. bombards don't really need a nerf (maybe a very small one) and they certainly don't need a buff.\n\nBasically, space planes have a radar dampening range less than their weapon range, allowing them to hit stuff without stuff being able to hit back. This allows them to win some really silly match-ups against stationary targets.\n\nEDIT: Actually, this is a decently nice ability for space planes in human hands, but a real pain (and not the fun kind of pain) to deal with when they are in AI hands"}

Because the 'repeated' stuff is some of the meatiest stuff in the book: Core Mechanics, Equipment, and general setting info. Just like in the 40k books.\n\nAnd the real reason is that book prices and size are based on number of 'packets' inside them. 3 chapters - especially the rules and generic setting stuff and equipment that would be repeated in each is going to be 48 pages easily (2 packets), and likely in the 72-96 range with all the art, that's enough to drop down 5-10 bucks on a hardcover. In 40k RPG terms it's the difference between the Core Books and a Rites of Battle style once yearly 'big book'. That's quite all right too. I'll take a cheaper version. Thoguh as I said, ideally we get a similar size with more NEW stuff.\n\nAnd incompatible? 40k games ostensibly all work on the same mechanic.

Just compare Ascension level Dark Heresy characters with starting Deathwatch Marines. Same XP level, DRASTICALLY different power levels. Rough equivalents, but not seamless by any definition of the word. It takes work to make them work together.\n\nI think that you're looking at it the wrong way.

Obviously it will be far more complicated and probably use. I dunno, strangelets or something. An active augury would be more of a spherical snapshot, like an electronic echolocation. In both cases, the key point is that you are emitting energy in order to get an image. Passive augury, on the other hand, would simply entail keeping an electronic ear out for vessels broadcasting their transponders (Ship name, current heading and speed at its' most simple) or scanning them.\n\ntl;dr: If you actively scan something, you are also sending a signal that indicates your current location."}
{"text": "Gravitation issueAcceleration due to gravity is a single constant in most physics engines. Changing a single variable in a program is not difficult to do. However, I can't predict the effects on gameplay it would have.\n\nI feel like this falls under that broad category of things that would be realistic, but both fluffy and detracting from the fun of the game. Also, I can see the vast implications such as those you mentioned above being a nightmare to mess with just for the sake of an added sense of realism.\n\nAcceleration due to gravity is a single constant in most physics engines. Changing a single variable in a program is not difficult to do. However, I can't predict the effects on gameplay it would have.\n\nI can recall simple gravity realization in Mechwarrior 2 games, it affected top speed only, AFAIKGravity I would tend to group under the larger heading of environment. High gravity would give an advantage to energy weapons and cause the most problems for LRMs. Dense fog / dust gives energy weapons problems. Depending on interpretation, a high argon atmosphere might be a problem specific to particle/ionizing weapons like PPCs.\n\nWe may not see it at first but I do see various changes from planet to planet that give an additional advantage to some mechs/weapons and a disadvantage for others.\n\nMost inhabited planets would be within a close % of 1g simply because that is where humans are most comfortable. Effects would be negligable and compensated for by the mechs computers. Weather and other environmental effects would have more effectP.S. Does anyone have knowlege on gravity realization in CryENGINE\u00ae3?\n\nCryENGINE2 has nice gravity realization, so I'm sure that CryENGINE3 would have it with much more reason. Crysis - (Core) is the chapter that uses zero gravity with first person navigation, enemy confrontation and floating objects.\n\nFor the most part if this is implemented at all, I would recommend it sticking to affecting top speeds, acceleration/deceleration, and jump jet height and fall speed. That would give it realistically basic and fun effects, while not becoming too complicated and interfering with players that don't want to have to take a training course just to effectively compensatethis would be an interesting thing to see, the Atlas is rated at 100 Tons, so if it were operating in that environment, it would make sense to reduce it's mass to the rated weight for the chassis.Having to strip 20 tons from somewhere. After all ,machines are built to a specification and exceeding that is often a bad thing\n\nAtmospheric density would increase with gravity too, so there would be thicker atmospheres, imagine a duststorm on a high-g world thicker air and it would hold a lot more dust too i would imagine\n\nI would imagine it would not be such a big hindrance from a programming point of view, not necessarily more challenging than programming a mech's movement, for instance, in/under water, in a tornado, in a blizzard, and in a sandstorm depending on the forces to which the mech/pilot is exposed.\n\nFrankly, I would love to see different gravity scenarios on planets at some stage but also inside/outside space stations/ships (as described in some Battletech novels) ...\n\nWow you just gave me an idea for some interesting maps; what if there was a huge storm in the middle of a battle? could happen on any map? think of an atlas in a tornado !, may change the out come of any battle?\n\nHonestly, an Atlas 100 ton chassis can probably withstand 120 tons of actual weight just due to the fact that all the components and joints are overengineered to withstand a rediculous amount of impact, jarring, heat, falling down, etc... walking slowly in the rear guard, you can probably add anywhere between 10-20% additional equipment on any 'Mech chassis above the light class.\n\nJust an observation, I am NOT saying 'Mechs should be able to carry more than their rated weight."}

For one, it wouldn't really fit the game's image very well at all. add to that Shadow Revolution's shiny, high tech theme, and this is really just an idea for a plausible Liberation front unit.\nImagine you're part of the old world order, and you want to fight back against the OoN. They keep backing you against the wall, and you're running out of functioning units, but hey, this is America and you've got one of these:     (skip to about 56 seconds in)   (holy crap!)\nYou get the idea.\nThey're big, armored, and built to carry really heavy stuff. Impromptu weapons platform?\nThe pros would be extreme cheapness: they're already built, just weld something dangerous to the roof and armor over the wheelwells/driver's seat. instant disposable tank. Some of them are so monster truck they could probably crush your average tank of today.\nThe cons are obvious. they're not designed for battle. Controlling them would feel clumsy at best. The weapon of a desperate tank commander or someone with lots of guts/insanity.\nI don't think it would be for PvP at all, but it would make a really interesting PvE mission in story mode. A last ditch attempt to take back a OoN controlled weapons depot using only non-conventional vehicles and gear.\n\nThey would make really eye-popping decoys, wouldn't they?\nI don't know if unconditional suicide is an appropriate theme to model a unit around like it was in dune 2 or the Homeworld expansion, but you could put an awful lot of explosives into the back of one of those babies, too.\n\nMaybe they can rig up some sort of mechanism to hold the gas pedal down and steer forward. It wouldn't be perfect, so when you used the superpower, the vehicles will go forward for the most part, but would also start to veer off a bit. Some may even flip over early, or crash into other videos and explode prematurely\n\nThe army and airforce is actually testing new hardware to adapt civilian vehicles into combat vehicles currently. A prop plane for instance can replace a jet with a much smaller pricetag, and can arm many of the same weapons, has shorter runways, easier to work on etc.\n\nAnother example is apperently a humvee costs close to 150 grand, but a suburban with a add on armor kit is projected to cost 1/3rd that."}

Immobilizing transports will force their passengers out. Preventing an enemy vehicle from shooting for a turn is often enough (unless it can shrug off those results like GK), etc. While every DE player dreams of having first turn and alpha-striking most of the enemy off the table, this will (almost!) never happen in reality. Instead, you need to use your movement and weapons (and cover, hence why LOS blocking stuff is vital) to hide from some of his army, and shutting down the rest (whether it be through stunned, shaken, etc).\n\nWhen I play DE, I generally plan my movement and shooting around preventing my opponent from shooting back in his turn. Nothing more annoying than having your vehicles which can see the enemy unable to shoot due to damage table results, while the ones who can shoot are either out of range or out of LOS!"}

It's Console set up is the same, its crew is the same, its hull is the same, its impulse turn rate, and inertia ratings are the same, its weapon set up is the same. It's not a refit. All that is different is the BOFF set up and an overpriced console. Outside that BOFF set up and Console, it remains identical to the other Advanced escort, that means it lacks what makes a Refit a Refit.\n\nOk, that does make your point more clear. However you're wording here 'you are not making one refit more powerful than any other refit' is confusing. Are you agreeing that giving it an extra slot is not making it more powerful, did you do a common typo and meant now and typed not? I'm confused.\n\nAnd lets go back a bit. You pointed out that the T5 retro has the same weapons as the T5 norms. Well the T5 norms has the same weapons as a T4. See that flaw? Cruisers and Escorts all gain an extra weapon slot at the transition of T4 to T5, Science does not. The standard power and maneuverability and other buffs that happen from T4 to T5 happen with it as they do all the other classes of ship, but unlike the others, T5 Science ships gain no extra offensive capabilities to deal with endgame level enemies where as Escorts and Cruisers do.\n\nThe choice to fly an escort with beams is not part of the equation. Yes if you take an Escort and an Intrepid with a forth fore slot and equipped them with the same weapons they would produce similar DPS. However running an Escort with beams is not going with its maximum DPS potential, so it doesn't invalidate the argument. If a Science could run dual and dual heavies then yes it could match an Escort in DPS potential but since it can't it never will. An escort will always be able to be fitted to do more DPS.\n\nShould read\n\nScience t4 ships have the same numbers as Science T5 vessels. So by giving a t5 refit an extra weapon you are making one refit more power then any other refit.\n\nAs for escort with out cannon. Well in that case if you put dual beam on your front slots on science ship you do more damage as well."}

Is that considered a projectile weapon, or a mine layer? It fires out a torpedo that bursts open into a dozen or so transphasic mines. So would a console that increases transphasic projectile damage give those mines it's bonus?\n\nRight now I have a console that increases all forms of kinetic damage, which I'm assuming includes my mine because it just says kinetic damage and doesn't mention projectiles. But I also have another console sitting in my bank that boosts projectile damage - and the same kind of damage type that my mines are. Should I mount that console or not? Would it have any actual effect on my mines?For all intents and purposes Mines and Torpedo's are the same. But your better off powering up say Quantum than kinetic in general. Anything that is not energy and therefore launched is on the same level. It would probaly be better described as launched.\n\nThe Transphasic Mine Launching torpedo, can not be modified by Mine skills or Torpedo Skills. That being said it is effected by Transphasic Consoles, Kintetic Consoles and Projectile weapons skills.Quantum is just the middle ground between photon and tricobalt. Photon is low damage, but fast firing. Quantum is medium damage with a slower rate of fire. Tribobalt is massive damage but takes forever to reload. If you crunch the numbers, as Cryptic has, you'll find that they pretty much even out in the end.\n\nAs for the mine launcher, it's not crap - just replay the mission & get a new one at your actual level. I've had plenty of fun keeping it on as an aft mount, right beside my actual mine dispenser. This let's me smack down two minefields simultaneously on anything that tries to get on my tail; there is no cool-down separating them because they're technically different systems. Usually they get visually overloaded by all the transphasics popping up right in their face to notice that one lone tricobalt in the middle... until it's too late."}

In our current game we have an AI Progress of 340 and the AI has about 5-20 Stealth Battleships on each planet. I think it's a bit too much. Since the cap for human player is like 4 per mark level and they're very expensive I don't think the AI should get that many.\n\nIt's getting pretty hard to get through anywhere since these monsters are so effective at destroying anything they come by.\n\nWell in our game we have both of the last core reactors on different parts of the galaxy. The other one 9 hops away and the other 5 something. Got the core reactor 9 hops away by first going with force with an armored golem and some fleet to destroy the tachyon guardians and most of the fleet and guard posts on the planets on the way, left the CS's intact though. Then with cloaker starships sneaked some Colony ships on the planet, made a CS and took the core reactor out.\n\nNow this sounds pretty simple but it took about 2 hours to actually do this. And I might have to do this on a smaller scale again on the other core reactor. --\n\nAnd to top that, both homeworlds are right now about 10 hops away, each in totally different direction. Right now we have about 25 planets. --------------------\n\nSo, a few patches that I think would be nice to lessen micromanagement.\n\n1. The auto-build remains rebuilders/engineers doesn't work on allied planets, only on your own. So if you have turrets on an allies planet you always have to make sure to manually reconstruct engineers and remains rebuilders there. This should be fixed.\n\n2. There should be an option to auto build energy reactors on your allies planets as well. Since you almost always have to do it anyway.\n\nAs well polished this game is, managing the amount of power you have is really not that well thought out. Or rather, it lacks a good interface.\n\nFirst of all, I can't directly see how many Mark III power plants I've built on the galaxy. Or rather, I can't see at all how many power plants I've built all in all.\n\nSo say, I have a 200 000 excess power, and I remember I had a Mark III power plant made somewhere. I have to manually skim through each planet on the galaxy view to see which one has 3 energy reactors. And then, I have to pick energy reactors from the list, pick Mark III energy reactor and put stop in it. Now I have 110 000 Excess power. I then need to manually turn off many of some of the mark II energy reactors which is really tedious micromanagement that I'd rather use for something else. --\n\nJust make a simple interface from the CTRLS view where you'll be able to turn off Energy reactors at will without the need to manually visit each and every planet.\n\nBeen playing against a AI lvl 6 and 7, and we still get beaten by the exogalactic waves. The first waves aren't that bad but after some hours it starts to be \"6-12 massive ai ships en route to destroy you\". How do you survive these?\n\nWe had to switch from playing against 7 and 8 AI because these waves just kill you. The waves always have mark IV and V ships too. They just chew up fortresses like nothing. I dunno, the other part of the game is not that hard, the exo waves are a real killer though.\n\nJust played our game \"almost\" through. We stomped everything except for the last main base and had everything secured. 5000 troops, Superfortress, a lvl 3 fortress and a million turrets guarding the only planet leading out. The AI just amassed an Armada of ships, there was nothing we could do.\n\nOver 30 starships came in each wave. Around 24 of alien starships which I figure is Spire and Zenith starships. And 400 troops of mark V ships. The waves came in every 30 seconds or so. In an hour we had lost all our planets and every planet had about 100-400 mark V ships with lots of starships.\n\nI mean yeah, the AI progress was almost 2000 but the AI shouldn't be able to amasss such an army from just one planet, it's a little bit more unfair than the usual unfairness that there is in this game.\n\nI've had 4 golems in the last game I played. All were killed very quickly. Got two Artillery golems, a regen and a botnet golem. Not at the same time on the game ofc. Out of them only the Artillery one seemed to have any use before dying. The other ones just were killed instantly. Even when I sent them with 500 troops against like 200 AI troops.\n\nHow much do you need to micro them to keep the Golems alive? I don't find them that useful for me since usually in a few seconds they're down to like 10-30% health.\n\nThe 5000+ cross planet attacks etc. sound very scary but actually are not since the AI carriers are so dumb. How it basically has went down for me is they have maybe 2000 troops at large or less, and the rest are in carriers.\n\nBut, when I bring my troops on a planet to battle the AI the carriers somehow just wait there and don't try to go after any of my key planets or unload at that planet to assist the battle.\n\nSo basically I bring my own 5000 troops to defend against the 2000 AI + 3000 in carriers, and when I've dealt with the \"ground troops\", I shoot down one carrier, now 5000 my troops vs 1000 AI. I take them down, now there's just a few carriers left which I also take down one by one.\n\nAnd my losses in that battle will be very marginal because I always overpower their ground troops by at least 2 to 1 but the losses for AI are huge.\n\nFor people new to AI Wars, what AI Eyes do is they will spawn more troops for the AI if you go 2x over the troops they have on the planet. So say, they have 100 dudes over in their planet, if you send in 201 people, the AI Eye will start spawning more fleet for the AI. ---\n\nAs of this moment in all of my games, AI Eyes are spawned on around 60 of all the 80 planets. This really makes the game feel repetitive cause you always have to deal with the planets in the same manner.\n\n1. Send all bombers you have and a distraction fleet with them so the bombers don't take all the damage. The distraction fleet can't be good against dealing against the AI troops since this will diminish their numbers and the AI Eye will spawn hell on you. Rather send in a very crappy army + bombers. 2. Bombers are probably able to take out about half of the guard posts in that planet 3. Rebuild bombers and repeat.\n\nDealing with AI Eyes is REALLY grindy. Cause you almost never are able to take out all the guardposts in one go AND you can't afford to send in a complex fleet of any kind because then you will go over the double limit AI Eyes have and it will spawn free bots against your fleet. I'm sure everybody's also had to deal with sending a fleet in that doesn't go over the AI Eye limit and then watch as the AI uses almost all of their fleet on that planet to attack your base which in turn makes the AI Eye spawn a huge free defensive army for the AI on the planet. And if your troops were already deep in territory with the AI Eye now blocking escape back to your own planet you can say goodbye to them.\n\nI think the AI Eye is a fun concept if it was special event. Like if there were only a handful of planets say 10 in the whole galaxy that had em'. But now it really feels like your huge fleet is always just standing there as you send in a wave of 200 dudes at max. AND, you're never really dealing with looking at, hey, what is their fleet comprised of in this planet? Should I send in more of these dudes to counter those? No, you're always forced to send max bombers to take out the guard posts as fast as possible so you can send in your main fleet.\n\nI don't want to worry about sending in a fleet that WILL destroy the enemy cause the Eye will just spawn more of them. Isn't finding a good fleet composure that kills the enemy kinda the point anyway?\n\n- Player Home planet under small attack \" Keep it cool, we won't lose here\" - Player home planet under medium attack \" All cannons load... fire!!\" - Player home planet under heavy attack \" We can't fall now!! All units, engage the enemy!\"\n\nI'm sure not everyone would appreciate this, and it would be some work to be done. But in my opinion it would make this game just that little bit more lively, that feeling that you're actually fighting for the survival of the humankind. Btw, I'm not saying the lines should be precisely that what I just wrote. They could be comical, dramatical, overplayed, cheesy, hell whatever. Even better if it was a mixture of all of them."}
{"text": "Which falls to Zerg to neural a few of your ravens to HSM your ravens off; that's the counter, if they haven't already fungaled your ravens a mile away. Banshees are the safest way to kill infestors, but that fails when the zerg has lots of infestors and some mutas/corruptors/queens/hydras. Battlecruisers fail spectacularly at killing infestors; their attack is too slow and close ranged, and their yamato is easily countered with a neural. There's really nothing the other races can do to out air a zerg with only air units.\n\nYou can get HSM off while the neural is charging at the raven, which I believe depletes the energy or most of the energy for the raven. This also does splash which kills units outright rather than applying a DoT.\n\nEssentially, the terran has more firepower, with HSM being ridiculous with aoe damage if it gets off. The zerg needs to split their units extremely well to mitigate HSM damage. And don't forget that Ravens and Banshees have the same tech path, so a couple cloaked banshees flanking for the express purpose of taking out infestors when the battle begins are extremely effective.\n\nYou're not worrying about out-airing a zerg, you're worrying about beating a corrupter/infestor army with skyterran. If there are infestors in the battle there's no reason you can't have ghosts cloaked, flanking to EMP the infestors. By the time you're worrying about maxing out on battlecruisers and ravens, you're in a plenty good enough position to have 5-10 ghosts as well.\n\nNeural has a range of 7, which outranges HSM by 1. Fungal has a range of 9, which means it's effect is slightly farther. Certainly depends on the positioning and spread of units on both ends, but infestor counters raven. You also can't spare the gas for ghost tech as well, and if you do, it's simply a matter of swarming your ghosts with ling/bane before bringing in the infestors. This build is plain bad and gimmicky, relying on your opponent to be of significantly inferior infestor micro compared to your raven micro to work. It's fun once in a while to pull off, but I don't think it should be one's main TvZ build."}

Witness my predicament: it's 5.30am here in the UK and I've given up trying to sleep between bouts of horrible d&v (if you don't know, you don't want to), as I keep having weird waking nightmares about murderous accountants and cricket players when I try. So, having gone off-topic before there is a topic, do I have something productive and non-self-pitying to say? Well yes, as you ask:\n\nI haven't posted this to mantis as I'm still fairly new and thus may be missing some ingenious mechanic or nuance that makes this unnecessary, but would people value (and would it be possible to implement) a new move type that works as follows:\n\n- Combine-able with group move and wormhole move, but not FRD or normal attack move. - Once given, ships move to the specified destination as they would with a standard move. - Once each ship arrives, it then enters attack move mode. - Fin.\n\nNumerous times, I find myself wanting to cluster all my ships into a 'blob' as quickly as possible, but then for them to be under attack move conditions at their new destination.

There's probably not reason for a separate move mode just to get rid of a couple of clicks. Ah wells gave me something to do!\n\nSomehow I missed that. But yeah: we're running out of keyboard space, and my goal is also not to have a lot of new ship border colors. The more colors you have, the more meaningless they all become. That's why we make it so that the orders can all be mixed and matched and queued and all that sort of thing, is that then all the various permutations become possible.\n\nMore border colors! We need party move, where the ships all get a fluctuating rainbow border, and when they reach the destination they throw a raging kegger. We can invite the AI and work out our differences through dance.\n\nThat's what the alcohol is for. Enough of that and you won't remember that you can't dance and/or sing.

{"text": "noob question relating to my BO's but not allowed to start a thread? anyway i cant assign my tac or science officers into my stations and from reading it would seem its because ive ranked them up and the stations are for ensigns, BUT, i have an engineer in an ensign slot no prob who is lt rank? and on other parts of the forum ppl say u can put higher ranks into low rank slots you'll just lose access to the higher rank space ability. Now here is my question, if you get access to your officers abilities in space by putting them in stations, why is it i can use my BO's unlocked abilities in space who aren't even in a station at all and why can i assign a lt engineer into an ensign slot but not my lt tac or science officer into an ensign slot as well?\n\nPlease help lol\n\nYou are misunderstanding how Bridge Stations work. Bridge Stations have 2 attributes the class/career of the Bridge officer that is allowed to be assigned to it and a rank. Allowable Bridge Officers (BOFFs) will be Tactical, Engineering, Science or Universal. If the allowed BOFF are career specific, you can only assign a BOFF of that career to that station; i.e. you can only assign an Engineering BOFF to an Engineering Bridge Station. Rank does not matter in this regard. You can assign any Bridge Officer to a Universal Station.\n\nRank of the Station comes into play when determining which abilities of the assigned BOFF can be used. The Rank of a Station is the highest ranked abilities of the BOFF that can be used. So if you assign a Commander rank BOFF to a Lieutenant Rank Bridge Station, you will only be able to used the Ensign and Lieutenant rank abilities of the BOFF. Likewise, you can slot an Ensign ranked BOFF into a Commander Rank station, but you'll only be able to use the Ensign rank abilitiy of the BOFF So the rule of thumb is that the higher of the Rank of the Station or the Rank of the Bridge Officer determined the most powerful ability of the Bridge Officer assigned to the station.\n\nExtra Commissioned Bridge Officers (i.e. BOFF on the left side of the Stations window) which are not assigned to a Bridge Station don't have any affect in space. However you can change Station assignments anytime you are not in combat."}
{"text": "Any ship that's eligible to be included in an exo is eligible to be a leader; the leader is just the ship with the highest cost in the group (if there are multiple at the same cost, a random one is picked from that set).\n\nBeam starships have been eligible for exos since exos were, I believe They're in the same cost-set as Core Starships. And warbirds are now, too.\n\nTangentially related to exos, have you thought about allowing motherships to spawn during the final \"push\" of the spire campaign once you complete it?\n\nThink about the epic showdown of 8 super-dreadnoughts vs. 5 motherships, plus a whole bunch of other stuff.\n\nNow I understood that you disabled motherships during the \"triumphant push\" for a few reasons. One, to ensure that the spire would win. Two, to not make it an instant loss if the AI makes it to you before the Spire can take out both AIs. And Three, because of their core shield gen properties.\n\nTo deal with one, careful tuning of the mothership spawn rate would take care of that. So long as the mothership's spawn rate (adjusted for firepower and durability) is less than the spire spawn rate (adjusted for firepower and durability), the Spire will eventually win. (Basically, make it such that once both start spawning, the number of motherships spawned over a time T does not overpower the number of super-dreadnuaghts + dreadnaughts spawned over time T) This may be a tricky ratio to find, but it would be epic.\n\nDo deal with three, you can make a separate version of the mothership that does not have CSG properties, but is otherwise identical, and have that spawn during the \"final push\"So even when the AI is \"panicking\" about the huge swarm of massive Spire stuff headed their way, they still don't get enough \"exo-points\" to afford motherships? That seems a little strange.\n\nAs I mentioned, the kill-all-CSGs logic could be sidestepped by having a version of the mothership that doesn't have CSG properties, and use that during this time.\n\nYea, the normal CSGs are there to force a certain number of planet captures (and thus AIP) before you can win the game. The mothership's CSG is there just to make sure you can't win without killing it. Otherwise to fulfill its \"defensive\" purpose it would have to just camp the AI Homeworld forever. I could make it do that, but I think you wouldn't like it very much, depending on where the wormhole exits were placed on that particular homeworld Being forced to engage that thing from maximum range is... extremely painful."}
{"text": "One of the big perks of being a Rogue Trade is that you are allowed to interact and deal with the Xeno. But, how is that handled on the other side of your trade route? Buying alien wares is all good and dandy, but whom are you selling them to? Most xeno technology seems forbidden and/or blasphemous so the authorities would take a dim view on you selling that stuff to imperial citizens. Of course, raw materials are no problem, but what other xeno wares can be sold legally? Do you have any guidelines?\n\nI was thinking about this exact subject. I think Xenos wares are fine for selling as long as the arent being imported into the imperium but smuggling items in or selling them to cold traders is a definate way of getting more prfoit than making legal trasactions outside the borders of the imperium.\n\nI think the Kasabasilica mission in Footfall (and port wander, too if I'm thinking correctly) tries their level best to buy up all things Xenos. their competitors do the same. so a Rogue Trader can hit footfall with a load of Xenos artifacts, sell it to one of the organizations that deals in that stuff and walk away clean. no muss, no fuss and doesn't have to worry about the details of what happens next.\n\nalso - most humans won't know if something is Xenos make. ignorance is bliss, remember? as long as something isn't obviously creepy, weird or psychic odds are most humans won't know anything about Xenos gear or items. it'll be different tho, which is a whole other issue. but if you sell it properly you might convince someone they aren't buying xenos items, its really just some very very strange archeotechhmm.\n\nwell, at a guess I'd say that high ranking members of imperial society could legally purchase Xenos gear (so long as it wasn't TOO offensive and/or blatantly obvious). Generals of the Imperial guard, various and sundry nobility, trading cartels looking to seem more impressive/fearsome. Members of the adeptus mechanicus looking to rip apart Xenos gear to learn it's secrets and/or figure out how to destroy it's makers easier. the Imperial Inquisition might want to legally aquire Xenos tech for all sorts of reasons that don't bear thinking about. Then of course there's illegal cultists who might arrange to legal purchase Xenos items for their nefarious purposes - after all, why steal it when you can just BUY it? set up a shell corporation, buy your various required items legally\u2026and then disappear foreverFind the right (wrong?) members of the Inquisition who are radical enough to believe that the weapons of the enemies of mankind should be used against their creators, or Heretek Adeptus Mechanicus who seek to study their technology to see how it could be made complaint with STC patternsI believe that the point is to trade xenotech with those willing to buy it outside the Imperium to aquire favours, objects and the like that ARE legal and highly sought after by the Imperium or somebody in it. Obviously, selling to Ordo Xenos or a Magos Xenologis would be perfectly legal (although I envy your contacts if Ordo Xenos buy stuff from you). You could trade that tech with a mercenary group as payment for their help in purging an ancient human city, where you get the dibs on all the cool stuff, or you trade an eldar tech for a document detailing the location of something or other.\n\nThen, of course, there are the illegal markets, but that is not the subject of this thread.\n\nI would imagine that there'd be a legal blockage in the fact that while selling to the Inquisitoon and Magos Xenologis is legal, just being in possession of it within Imperial space is not. I would imagine you'd still have to smuggle the goods to a forge world in order to \"legally\" sell it. Well, either that or arrange for the Magos to come personally pick it up outside Imperial space, which I doubt the Magos would consider that unless it is very valuable.\n\nfrom my understanding; so long as the authority don't find Xenotech in your cargo hold, you're good to goExcept that is the in-universe explanation for 40K. Forget the promise of progress and understanding, for in the grim and dark future, there is only war. Rogue Traders are meant to make contact with Xenos races, assess them as a threat to the Imperium (possibly through posthumous examination of the Rogue Trader's shattered hulk of a vessel), and then categorize whether or not they need to be wiped out immediately, or just sort of ignored and dealt with when the Navy has a moment.\n\nNow there are a lot of radical Inquisitors, bored nobles and AdMech who will happily buy things from you, but they're not going to blatantly advertise that's what they're doing. The only real place where you can find a market where selling these things doesn't get you executed on site would be a place like the Koronus Expanse which is not technically Imperial Space. Even then though, you might face some pointed questions when you come back if you're viewed as having gone native.\n\nThe place where xenos technology is openly traded, analyzed and discussed is the Tau Empire. There are hints that there's a portal to the Eastern Fringe somewhere in the Koronus Expanse, so if you find that you could probably set up a market over there as well.\n\nYou wouldnt have to got hat far at all. The Kronus expanse is like the wild west, it is wilderness space the imperium can't enforce it so they allow private intrests to develop it and assess it thus rogue traders. Since your not in the imperium xenos technology is not proscribed and you dont have to worry about being prosecuted at all.\n\nThis is why rogue traders are seen as dangerous by the rest of imperial society, while their brining the light of the emperor into the darkness they come into contact with dangerous and blasphemous things. This is accepteable because as their warrant states they act as the voice of the emperor byond his realm and they can do what ever they see fit while their out there.\n\nThis is also why rogue trader wars are technicly legal as well. Their petty squables are ignored by the imperium because it doesn't have the resources to enforce the areas of space the rogue traders operate in.\n\nLegal trading of xenos good can defniately take place just so longa as you dotn bring it to any imperial controlled planet so damaris is a no go. But footfall or the breaking docks are fine. In fact higher lelvels of imperial society proabbly like things this ay sincce it encourages development without any cost to the imperium itself. By keeping illegal goods proscribed from imperial space it protects citizens from corruption while simulatneously forcing rogue traders out into undeveloped regions.\n\nIf you have access to it, I recommend reading the cold trade section of Hostile Acquisitions. It addresses warrants that allow for trading with xenos.\n\nApparently it is legal for a RT who's warrant specifically states it, to sell xenos artifacts within the boarders of the imperium. It just that the trade is so profitable that those traders who's warrant does not allow them to to risk sanction.\n\nHOWEVER, the inquisition will keep a close eye on any traders importing xenos artifacts, regardless of their warrant and will intervene if they deem the artifacts to be too heretical."}

Here is the answer. In a roundabout way....\n\nA number of times in the past I've railed against the concept of a Design Doc. The basic reason was that, by it's very nature, it locks you guys out of the development of the game. All the base decisions are made when writing the thing, and it pretty much becomes the bible for development. And that's a concept I hate (the part about you guys not being able to contribute). So, for a long time, we didn't have one. And in actual fact, I think that was a good thing. If I had written a DD right at the start, MD would be a whole different game, and not nearly as good a game, for that matter.\n\nBut let's face it, ultimately I was wrong. It may have been good to have the game in an evolving state for a while, but at some point we needed to lock it down and say \"THIS is going to be the game\". Having a DD was the best thing that ever happened to MD. It keeps me focused. It keeps me from burnng out because there is a clear light at the end of the tunnel (even when we are far from it). It keeps feature creep from happening. It keeps things *moving forward*, and that's important.\n\nBut, it does keep you guys out of the loop. And I still hate that.\n\nWell, here's your chance to get back in The first item in the M9 overview table is \"Technology Data Input\". M9 is all about the research screen. And for that, we need to know what technologies will be there to be researched. And that's where you guys come in. It's not too early to start thinking about this. In fact, we are probably a bit late.\n\nYou are still going to be constrained by the DD. I'm not putting in any systems that are not already listed in the Milestone Overview section, so you can't suggest any technologies that lead to systems that are not already there (although I admit, the overview can be vague, so if you need clarification on anything, do feel free to ask).\n\nThe format is going to be thusly:\n\nThere will be some number of catagories (originally I had planned on 8 of them, but that's not set in stone). In each catagory there will be some number of breakthroughs. Each breakthrough will have some number of advancements. What the exact catagories are I'm going to leave open for the moment until we start to see patterns in the technologies.\n\nThe catagories are just there for organizational purposes. Players don't research a \"catagory\" nor are they a prereq for anything. They are just there to give the player a tool to keep things from getting too overwhelming. Basically you get one research tree per catagory.\n\nBreakthroughs are things players research. They do not give out a toy of any sort (I'll define \"toy\" in a bit). A breakthrough may have another breakthrough as a prereq, but it should not require any advancement to be finished in order to research the breakthrough. Breakthroughs form the backbone of the research tree (the branches). Every breakthrough should, at a minimum, have at least one advancement that it is a prereq for (otherwise, what is the point of the breakthrough?).\n\nAdvancements always have at least one breakthrough as a prereq. They may have more. They may also optionally have other advancements as a prereq. All advancements give out ONE \"toy\" to the player. Advancements are the leaves in the research trees.\n\nResearch is done by the players via research points (determined by your cities, buildings in your cities, and leader skills [and maybe a couple of other misc things]). You can select any breakthrough or advancement to study as long as you have the prereqs for it. Once you have invested enough research points into a particular breakthrough or advancement, your Civ gets that credited, which gives them a new toy (in the case of an advancement) and/or fulfills prereqs for other breakthroughs/advancements.\n\nYou get one (and only one) toy for every advancement you research. Toys fall into a number of catagories, but in general are always something the player can use in some way in the game. They are (if I don't forget any catagories):\n\nResource Type: Gold, Oil, Coal, etc. Causes the appropriate resource stacks to appear on the map and allows the player to begin collecting that resource.\nUnit Template: Tank, Ship, Warrior, etc. Gives the player a blank template which they use to design their units. Each template has a set of characteristics and types of components that fit into that template.\nUnit Component: Machine gun, Diesel Engine, Body Armor, etc. Gives the players items that they can put into their templates when designing new unit types.\nCity Building: Things players put into their cities which modify the city characteristics (may give more research points, or allow building of certian types of units [e.g shipyard], or add to defense [walls, AA batteries], etc).\nLandscape Item: Things you build not within cities that modify the landscape (roads, bridges, dams, oil platforms, bunkers, etc).\nLeader Skill: Allows you to train you leaders with new skills, which in turn modify what they are capable of doing.\nEspionage Mission: Adds new types of espionage missions (sabotage, technology theft, and so on).\n\nI think that's all of them.\n\nNow, a lot of this I will design myself (that is, after all, part of my job), but by all means I'd love to get input from y'all. If you have an idea for a technology, send it in!\n\nWhen thinking about a technology, ask yourself:\n1) Is this a breakthrough or an advancement?\n2) What are it's prereqs?\n3) What sort of toy does it give out? Why? (i.e. does the toy make sense with the given advancement?).\n4) Does it fit within a given catagory? If not, perhaps it is the beginning of a new catagory?\n\nAlright, I'll stop here and let you guys get to thinking about it.\n\nLast edited by RonHiler; 08-26-2008 at 01:08 PM.\n\n\"They laughed when I said I was going to be a comedian ...

{"text": "Right now, it's possible to make special hulls or ship parts that regenerate fuel (in fact, Bigjoe5already did one). So, perhaps some parts for fuel generation when stationary (may be tied to the current system's star and planets types) and a part that would refuel any ships of the same allegiance present in the same system. Then, ships that need no ammo will go very far, but will have to stop and wait to regenerate fuelAs to the \"supply ships\", it would be a viable idea if supply is made differently. E.g. like in ASC. Not that carrying things around was a bad idea, it's just too unwieldy to do manually and automation requires extra programming which doesn't look like a high-priority thing. Also, trucks zipping around may both clutter screen and eat extra machine resources to process. For very small fleets it would be good and fun, but the more ships are here to supply, the worse it will be. So if you don't want to care about it all the time, just assume there are many little lame trucks and the supply range is defined as supply ships' range in first place.\n\nGeoff the Medio wrote:\n\nTBeholder wrote:Of course, if it's too easy, it removes the very point to have any support system in first place. But if it's too hard to do in unusual circumstances, why not have one more option. Maybe, keeping a pile of non-producing, but resupply-capable outposts just costs too much. Also, outposts are hapless sitting ducks, so once the enemy hit the line, it's broken, and rebuilding it means more time and expenses.\n\nIn the early game, it's OK for ship's fuel to dominate how far they can go, with supply range being secondary, since the strategic game in that point won't involve a lot of blockades. Later on though, it's more fun if supply lines dominate fuel range so that blockades become a valuable and effective tactic. I don't really see building a lot of outposts ever becoming bothersome. If supply range is great later in the game, you won't need that many outposts anyway. In an unpopulated empire you can get anywhere fairly easily, sure, but if there are enemies cutting off outposts which could supply your ships further away than they can actually get back on their own, then that means trying to go deep into enemy territory is potentially an extreme liability, which is a good way to add range limitations without force-feeding them to the player as hard limits. It's best if such liabilities are dependent on the actions of the opponent, because that enriches the competitive game.\n\n_________________ Warning: Antarans in dimensional portal are closer than they appear"}
{"text": "glad when they changed Fleet Action so you can play them at higher rank as well. Finally something to do.\nBut i was really disappointed when i found out that all you get from them is Mk IX items.\nI mean they are fun to do but the rewards you get from them are useless.\nAnd i also have millions of credits so theres no point to just sell them either.\n\nIt would find it much better if they would reward you with Mk X items.\n\nThe thing is ... even if they were MK X they'd mostly be vendor trash too.\n\nBecause most RA5's get their gear from requisitions. Especially if they're at the point where they're doing old fleet actions for fun.\n\nIf you got a MK X Postitron Deflector Array ... what would you do with it that'd be any different than a Mk IX?\n\nWell I will break it down as best as I can.\n\nMX X blues arent vendor trash, but MK IX are. This is because MK IX blue = MK X green. This is why, as you stated, \"most RA5's get their gear from requisitions\". However, MK X blues do sell, and are useful, because MK X blues > MK X greens you get from requisitions. The trouble is, the only way to get MK X blues is on STFs I believe. Even random drop world blues (EG one that might drop in B'tran) are vendor crap since they too are MK IX.\n\nAs for the \"MK X Postitron Deflector Array\" you referred to. Deflector arrays are one of the few useful epic items you can buy with the daily mission / STF badges, so a MK X blue array would indeed be quite useless.\n\nThe weapons that the badge vendors sell on the other hand are all antiproton/tricobalt and whatever. The trouble there is you lose so much speccing 9 points in, that to many, it just is not worth it to even use them over MK X greens.\n\nIn a nutshell, improving the loot in fleet actions gives you more variety in productive things to do at RA5 in a game that is severely lacking in them at max level.\n\nA lot of people still use MK X greens. So MK IX blues are just as useful as MK X greens.\n\nThe thing is ... your idea doesn't do anything to make loot more valuable. It just makes it more commonplace and less valuable.\n\nOk so you prefer useless loot, and buying stuff for 10 Million credits on the exchange? okay...\nIts supposed to be a reward. A reward should make you feel good, not meh-useless-crap ... *replicator recycles*\n\nAgree.. i tray SB24 fleet action yesterday.. i went second and i get a MK IX green regeneration shield.. i sell it on the replicator, not even bother to do it on a vendor.\nOk, yes, i was second, but the first one didnt got anything better..."}
{"text": "Originally by:Ashley SkyBut we did report it before using it and were told that it was not an exploit. Once, twice, three times a lady.

To be even more honest, I like this exploit very much. I like it because wardecing anyone everywhere for any reason is *******s. Not the ability to do that is what's bothering me nor is it the possibility of doing that. What bothering me is how it is done.\n\nMercs are licking their fingertips while listening to that GM's rubbish. Yeah, its a loophole and should stay so until ccp abolishes the ability to gang with a player who's at war via his corp or alliance with a player who isn't a member of the other two.\n\nYouTBH, the idea of announcing war is so last era, that for the Eve universe it should seem like a fantasy story... come on ccp - you can do much better than that. Make the pay for WDing dependent on the sec stat of the system a skirmish takes place in (the higher it takes place in, the more isk you need to pay officials to look the other way). Make the WD activation and cancelation player customized (e.g. min time to WD should be 0 to 24 hours. Canceling should be the same). Make a skill or use an existing one to reduce the WD cost in corporation skills (should be N/A to trials ofc). Let it be dependent on the differences between corp sizes - a much larger corp should pay more to mobilize through a system just to hunt down a much smaller group. That would even the odds a bit and still keep it real. Let people who just want to do missions create sub-divisions within NPC corps that would function like a normal corp but would not be possible to WD it and put a very long buffer to join it. Some people - a.k.a. carebears - don't want to play this game in any other way other than doing missions and trying to live through the game storyline. They enjoy co-operating with each other against no-one rather than anyone and that should be respected, even by those who excel on Pointless vs Porters...\n\nStarting to indeed wonder if this now should be about the part where offcourse it is a loophole and not entirely the way the system is meant to be, or if it should be about a GM comming in here and just stating, 'OMG IT IS AN EXPLOIT!!!' thereby ignoring their own rules completely.\n\nBy the ferocity of the GM's response i'm starting to wonder if the GM itself has any benefit in it beeing called an exploit.\n\nOriginally by:McEivalley YouWTH does this has anything to do with this tread's discussion?!

I think it would be best to apologizeIt's a good thing we're not a bogus alliance who's sole purpose is to give corps a way out of wars, or I might feel insulted by the tone of that news item.\n\niMune Empire is a real alliance who paid a real billion isk to create a one of a kind business model that succeeded in no time flat. One of the things we found was a one-click self-advertising perpetual way to bring hot headed action right to our doorstep, it worked flawlessly. Corps brought us free wars and donated hundreds of millions, our pvp corps/players got loads of hi-sec action, and we had tons of belly laughs watching it all unfold.\n\nI would of rather seen a new post made by GM Nova, but I appreciate the apology. This is the type of thread that should of been locked by a mod and a note to the OP telling him to file a petition. That would of made a world of difference here.

Second, I've been meaning to ask you: How exactly is this a business? It's all free, right? How do you make money from that? Unless you actually fight the wars you inherit and consider potential loot as a business, in which case a better business would be to actually declare war on fat incompetent corps and take their loot.\n\n/Edit: Looking at your alliance membership, you don't really have any PvPers to fight any wars, so you're still a bogus alliance trying to save face on the forums. Good luck with thatSolved.\n\nDumb and unoriginal.\n\nSince you have failed to prove 'dumb', I will take your post in a congradulatory manner.\n\nCould CCP just be honest with us, and tell us which dev's character is in a corp trying to make a war declaration?

{"text": "I\u00b4m putting this topic on, because I would like to start a discussion featuring ideas and deductions, that deals thoroughly with the operations and actions of RDA ESC 01 as well as other people on the world of Pandora. Everything included in one topic.\n\nI\u00b4m aware, that some technical, logistical and social ideas were mentioned in other topics, but would like to create a compendium regarding all these structures using our imagination and knowledge, without which this couldn\u00b4t happen. The topic will cover all the issues, from the basic principles of functional colony, logistics and technical issues, appearance of diffirent decks of HABMOBs and other sections, to the behavior of diffirent classes of workers, including health care, free time, administration and comunication.\n\nLets start then:\n\n1) According to the Survival guide, all the electrical energy on earth is produced by annihilation of matter and antimatter, from which we can deduce, that the same applies for the Hell\u00b4s Gate. My question is: what amount of antimatter is sufficient enough for the whole colony. One gram, two, maybe even more? Do they resupply the antimatter with every new arrival of ISVs, or do they have their own generators? (and how the mankind even optains the antimatter, that is another logical question).\n\n2) Again refering to the Survival guide, there is (or was) functional factory, which produced the weapons for SecOps and supplied spare parts for the vehicular fleet. I\u00b4m interested in the origin of their sources. I\u00b4ve never seen any mines, other than the one on Unobtanium (Unm), but making these components requires relatively broad variety of materials. Do they import the materials from Earth? Is it practical?\n\n3) In the movie, games and books we\u00b4re seeing wide array of machines, and I want to know on what fuels \u00b4em. According to many factors I doubt they\u00b4re fueled by fossil fuels (mainly because petroleum will be rare by the time of the 22. century, unless RDA finds the oilfields directly on Pandora). So are they fueled by hydrogen, or some other fuel?\n\nI thank everybody who participates in advance. I\u00b4ll be watching and updating this topic regularly, and will be glad if you\u00b4ll post some questions or theories on your own.\n\nI thank you very much and looking forward on cooperation.\n\nImperius Dictatio\n\n05-23-2010, 10:20 PM\n\n1. I found the Antimatter deal pretty stupid. Do you have any idea how much energy goes into making Anti-Matter? Instead of using the insane amounts of energy that goes into AM production they could have simply plugged themselves into whatever energy source they'd been using for making the AM and solved the whole movies energy issue. AM is only good for Space Travel,Weapons and oddly enough medical scanning tech.\n\n2.Possible. It's likely that they have smaller mines they tap into. Either that or they get materials for the Unobtanium mines that happen to be leftover. From what I can tell the only stuff they'd have to import from earth would be the really technical stuff.\n\n3. Batteries more then likely. Unobtanium is a room temp super conductor. Of course aircraft may use gas or something.\n\nSnowRider\n\n05-23-2010, 11:23 PM\n\n1) The only way that they could make antimatter work as an energy source is by using the Unobtanium in some way to make the process (i.e., energy) used in manufacturing the antimatter much, much more efficient. Otherwise, it is just as the other poster said, there's way too much energy needed to manufacture and store antimatter for it to be viable as an energy source.\n\nSo, they must use Unobtanium in some way to cut down on those costs.\n\nNow as far as the Hell's Gate colony is concerned, they wouldn't need very much antimatter to run it, but they'd need a constant source and/or resupply of antimatter otherwise they'd run out of what they have really, really quickly.\n\nAs for both the colony and Earth, there are probably other energy sources (e.g., deuterium and/or nuclear fusion) that they can use, but those probably don't provide as much bang for the buck as the matter-antimatter energy source.\n\n2) My guess is they import some of the stuff they need from Earth and manufacture the rest on site at the Hell's Gate factory. That would be much more efficient (every kilogram you don't have to ship from Earth to Pandora is one less kilogram you need to expend energy on to get from Earth to Pandora) but the down side is that the stuff they do manufacture on Pandora is probably fairly basic (i.e., rugged and simple) and not quite up to the quality that you would find in a factory or manufacturing plant on Earth.\n\n3) Either hydrogen or some combination of fuel cells and fusion (if the process of nuclear fusion could be miniaturized to the scale of a Samson or AMP suit. Recall that when the Colonel fires up his AMP suit for the first time, you can clearly see blue flames/exhaust emerging from the back of the suit. This suggests a fuel cell of some sort for that particular application, but there may be others.\n\nI too am curious about this subject and I wonder if we'll be seeing more of the logistics of operating and maintaining Hell's Gate as a plot point and/or a point of discussion in the sequel(s).\n\nTime will tell.\n\nScottWashburn\n\n06-25-2010, 12:46 PM\n\nAs noted above, anti-matter is not an energy SOURCE. We can make anti-matter today in tiny amounts but it takes huge amounts of energy to produce. And even if you assume some super-efficient method of making it in the future, you still cannot get any more energy out of it than you put into it. The Laws of Thermodynamics are without pity :) Anti-matter is an incredible means of STORING energy and is ideal for powering a starship. Trying to use it for anything else would be riduclously expensive and also horribly dangerous. Using it to power a combat vehicle would be like putting an enormous bomb in the midst of your own troops with a \"Kill Us!\" sign on it.\n\nBut I, too, am very interested in the logistics of Hell's Gate. I deal with this quite a bit in my fan fiction \"Aftermath\". Due to the expense of shipping things from Earth to Alpha Centauri it would make sense to make the base as self-sufficient as possible. It certainly makes no sense to ship gasoline or other fossil fuels to Pandora to run the helicopters and mining equipment. In the movie we do see some sort of faintly smokey exhausts coming out of the vehicles so they are definitely burning something. I would guess some sort of bio-fuel. There is probably a fuel plant at Hell's Gate that uses some genetically engineered bacteria to turn Pandoran plants into fuel. We're experimenting with stuff like that on Earth right now so it is certainly possible.\n\nMore later.\n\nScottWashburn\n\n07-01-2010, 02:37 PM\n\nOkay, it's later :)\n\nAs noted in my last post, I think there must be a fuel plant on Pandora to provide fuel for all those helicopters, bulldozers, digging machines and AMP suits. Fuel would be used in large amounts and shipping it in bulk from Earth would make no sense. But what about ammunition? Bullets and missiles for all those gunships. One of those Scorpion gunships carries over 200 missiles. Are they produced on Pandora or shipped from Earth? I'm guessing that they are shipped from Earth. As expensive as that might seem, I think it would still be cheaper than shipping the multiple factories needed to produce them to Pandora. At least for the missiles. Ammunition for the guns might be a possibility since they are relatively simple items. But the missiles have dozens of different components, each of which would have to be produced and then assembled. Shipping the factories needed for all that from Earth might be more than the RDA big-wigs would be willing to do. After all, they aren't on Pandora to fight a war. They would want to avoid conflict as much as possible. In a case like this there's just no profit from a war. So, I'm betting that all the heavy ordnance is shipped from Earth. This means that unless there is an enormous stockpile of it at Hell's Gate (unlikely) then even if Quartich had won the battle he might have found himself in serious trouble if the Na'vi weren't demoralized by the destruction of the Tree of Souls (It might make them really angry instead). If they had the will to pursue a long-term conflict, and resupply for Quaritch is six years away, they might possible be able to just wear out the Sky People.\n\nImperius Dictatio\n\n07-01-2010, 03:03 PM\n\nI remember hearing somewhere that the Hells Gate Facility has several autofactories to churn out a lot of their gear.\n\nScottWashburn\n\n07-01-2010, 06:46 PM\n\nOf course that's the unknown factor: what is production technology in 2154? If you can build versatile, adaptable factories that can produce almost anything you can supply it with the specs and raw materials for then that changes everything.\n\nSnowRider\n\n07-01-2010, 07:09 PM\n\nMy guess is the Hell's Gate facility is designed to be as self-sufficient as possible, as many others here have suggested.\n\nHowever, it can't be completely self-sufficient. It's at the end of a long supply chain back to Earth. The one thing, the one weakness Hell's Gate has is people and that is probably the primary purpose of the supply chain: getting fresh, new people to Hell's Gate and returning to Earth with Unobtanium and people who are rotating back to Earth at the end of their tours at Hell's Gate.\n\nWithout people to run the factories, maintain the equipment, keep everything running, etc. Hell's Gate falls apart pretty quickly.\n\nI am quite certain that its designers intended for Hell's Gate to be able to keep itself up and running in case something happens to the ISV train to and from Earth, but I don't think it can keep itself going indefinitely. If it has a full complement of people staffing it, sure it could maintain itself for a while, possibly for years, though I doubt it.\n\nAnd at the end of the movie, there are supposedly only a few scientists and technicians left behind after all the other humans leave Pandora.\n\nGranted, their energy needs, the demand on supplies, how much resources they will consume, etc. will be much, much smaller with only a few people, but it is my belief that sooner or later, Hell's Gate will start to fall apart.\n\nMax, Norm, and the others will have to deal with equipment breakdowns, critical machinery and systems wearing out and needing to be replaced, system failures, etc. the cumulative effect of which will keep getting bigger and bigger until sooner or later (probably sooner) the whole thing falls apart.\n\nWhat do they do then? They are marooned on a world humans were never intended to live on without a great deal of technology to keep them sustained and alive and when that technology starts to break down, they're screwed.\n\nThey might possibly regret kicking most of the humans off Pandora, because a lot of those people were there to keep everything up and running and without them, things will fall apart.\n\nI would not want to be in Norm, Max, and the others' shoes when that day comes.\n\nImperius Dictatio\n\n07-03-2010, 09:44 AM\n\nWe never saw any of the Techs left behind.\nOnly the Science team.\n\nSo yeah, I've been saying this for a while.\nThey're all screwed.\n\nScottWashburn\n\n07-04-2010, 03:04 PM\n\nSnow Rider makes some good points. I deal with quite a bit of that in my \"Aftermath\" fan fiction as well. Aftermath Chapter 1, an Avatar fanfic - FanFiction.Net (\n\nSnowRider\n\n07-05-2010, 03:54 PM\n\nAnother thought occurs to me.\n\nThe only way for Max, Norm, etc. to survive for a long time on Pandora if/when the infrastructure of Hell's Gate starts falling apart would be for them to in essence, \"go native\" and downsize their standard of living as much as is possible.\n\nScottWashburn\n\n07-05-2010, 07:23 PM\n\nConsidering the hasty evacuation of Hell's Gate by the humans, there is probably quite a bit of unobtainium lying around. Max and the other humans who stayed behind could probably buy pretty much anything they needed if the humans in orbit were willing to deal with them.\n\nSnowRider\n\n07-05-2010, 11:06 PM\n\nMore than likely, yes. But that is a very big if.\n\nIt would mostly depend upon how desperate the humans in orbit are to turn around and go home.\n\nI mean, can you imagine what it would be like to come out of cryo and find out that the Na'vi have booted the humans off Pandora?\n\nYou've spent almost six years in cryo, you come out, and find out you have to turn right around and head home?\n\nThat would suck dead dog farts.\n\nftxey Keye'ung\n\n11-04-2010, 02:22 AM\n\nThe power source for Hells-Gate was never mentioned on screen or elsewhere in the movie due to obvious reasons of keeping the pace and story going.\n\nTo add my two cents worth:\n\nThe Swan's and the mining vehicles would most likely be powered by hydrogen fuel cells or battery. ie: they recharge and are fixed to quadrants of the planet for certain amounts of time in designated areas for a few weeks perhaps before returning for a re-charge/re-fuel and overhaul to remove any build up of dirt, transmission wear and as we saw, the sporadic attacks by the natives.\n\nAs for the material resources, they would probably have to bring some with them to begin with and then mine the rest from the planet at source, they also have a massive stencil machine that carves the components from the raw or alloyed materials.\n\nThey would also have a recycling plant that melted down the old machines or damaged machines and then re-use them to build more.\n\nThe technology of the humans in the movie is pretty standard and could just as easily be today, with the addition of Unobtanium they could have giant flying mining equipment and vehicles such as the mag-lev trains on Earth using a series of overhead lines leading from the mines to Hell's-Gate....although they did seem to use roads on Pandora for the mines.\n\nImperius Dictatio\n\n11-04-2010, 01:09 PM\n\nExcept for the fact that none of the humans who remained on the planet are Techies or Engineers as they all seem to be Scientists with Soft Fields. (Anthropology for example.) nor are their a lot of them to begin with.\nAnd their in the frigging jungle....I'll give Hell's Gate maybe two or three years rops before the place is a wreck.\nThough it should only take a year for the power systems and air circulators to break down.\n\nScottWashburn\n\n11-06-2010, 07:09 AM\n\nLong-term survival would definitely be a problem for the remaining humans. One thing they do have operating in their favor is that there are a handful of them (10? 20?) living in a base meant for a couple of thousand. If they shut down everything except one small section they could then move to a new section when an old section fell apart to the point they couldn't fix it. Hopefully the RDA was smart enough not to have everything powered from a single generator or all the air coming from a single recycler. With multiple redundancy built in it might be possible to keep the place going for many years. And it would seem that the equipment is amazingly reliable. Consider the shack at Site 26: It could be left unattended, reoccupied, partly dismantled, carried somewhere and set up again and keep running with little or no maintenance.\n\nftxey Keye'ung\n\n11-07-2010, 01:53 PM\n\nRDA...and good old human ingenuity = Efficient modular buildings that are easily constructed and can be re-designed for multiple uses...the one thing we're good at...for the most part.\n\nImperius Dictatio\n\n11-16-2010, 09:18 AM\n\nStill it's a doomed effort.\nMachines break down if theirs no one their to maintain them or fix them up.\nNot to mention their in a jungle which if left unattended will creep onto the base and breaking stuff apart or covering it in a layer of choking vines and creepers and clogging up machinery.\n\nIt also doesnt take much to start wreaking the place up.\nThe building itself HAS to be airtight and maintaining that is going to be a pain.\nBecuase if theirs even a small hole or leak you'll be slowly letting in a dangerous toxin that you cant smell or taste.\n\nEven if they shut areas of the base down it's only prolonging the fact that in a very short time they will all die."}

{"text": "SWTOR Video: Space Combat \u2013 Javaal Fleet Action\n\n with that ship a space combat mini-game. This mini-game could honestly be a full game of its own, it's that good \u2013 and it gives pretty decent XP too\u2026\n\nBut why describe when I can just show you? Without further ado, ladies and gentlemen (but probably mostly gentlemen, who are we kidding really?) I give you YouTube evidence of the awesomeness that is SWTOR space combat:\n\nThe ship actually has its own \"character\" screen with slots for a fair variety of upgrades including armor, faster (and more powerful) guns and extended magazines that offer you more missiles. The gameplay itself is basically a rail-shooter, though you do have a fair amount of mobility and they do make you dodge the odd asteroid or space-station antenna. You can use the keyboard (or a joystick if you're so inclined) to move independently from your aim point, but it wasn't really necessary for this mission so aside from a few overly-arrogant barrel rolls my ship pretty much followed the mouse cursor. The XP awarded is standard for simply completing the encounter and once per day you're eligible for a special daily space combat mission that grants a fair amount of extra XP.\n\nIn the video I've got the best stuff I could get at my level in every slot so I actually outgear this starter mission pretty considerably. Without the gear, the missions can be challenging and even with gear they're still loads of fun, though your focus does change somewhat from survival to total devastation of the enemy. Odd that a minigame should be my favorite part of a new MMO, but then I suppose I'm an odd sort of fellow."}

{"text": "Another thing to note is humanity's homegrown FTL tech isn't unknown to the Reapers. The Reapers use the same FTL tech as well. It's another one of their secret tricks against their victims. Use the Citadel to help kill their victims' leadership and gain a large amount of data, shut down the mass relay network to isolate their victims and use their alternate FTL tech to bypass any mass relay blockades.\n\nWhat do you think the political complications will turn out? Another thing to note is there are very few mass relays (easy for humanity to blockade) into human space plus a sizable number of human worlds are located outside the practical range of eezo-based FTL. Meaning human developed FTL tech is the better choice.\n\nWeapons are mostly based on kinetic energy weaponry (eg. like chemical propellents, Gauss/railgun/linear tech) with some DEWs usually mounted on ships, vehicles or fortifications.\n\nI prefer Halo's pre-Covenant war political/historical background as a good setting prior to the discovery of element zero physics or mass relay technology at some colony a few years prior to first contact with the Citadel species.\n\nWell, the idea is what if humanity was already a spacefaring civilization before encountering element zero physics or mass relay technology? Meaning like in Halo or Mechwarrior/Battletech, humanity had developed their own FTL and other spacefaring tech.\n\nYou know, there were quite a number of AU ME fanfics where humanity had a different history and/or different tech base prior to encountering element zero physics or mass relay technology. One fanfic, a Mechwarrior/Battletech + Mass Effect Crossover titled, \"Exodus of Stars\", written by keiranhalcyon2010 got me thinking.\n\nI'd be happy to bounce ideas around with you.

{"text": "You've seen those NPC escorted convoys right. So, how about doing away with the escort and let players do that job.\n\n\"Arr Capt'n, I have a few ship loads of valuables I don't want to risk alone on the High Sea, so I will pay you handsomely to make sure they get where they are going safe.\"\n\nSo, a group mission\nEscorts are PvP flagged, or may enter into a fight if the escorted ships are attacked.\n\nThe idea is to use missions to generate more PvP. The escorted ships are either automated drones sailing to where ever or, the fleet commander, on the OS, controls them all as part of his ship icon (for the want of a better word), though when in battle, the NPC's revert to full game control.\nThe object for the attackers is to sink the NPC ships, so they have the double challenge of fending off and beating down the player escorts while the NPCs are running for dear life.\n\nDynamic Agents.\nOK, as I understand things, ports that can be contested require specific items either to boost the contention, or lower it. These only kick-in though if there is any contention.\nSo, how about making the ports dependent more on these things, that is, if they don't get a regular supply of the items then unrest starts and contention points start to be automatically gained for the none owning factions.\n\nThat actually gives none PvPers a more active role in the game. You want that nice port to stay uncontested, then you also need to help feed it with what it needs\n\nI gotta say I support a \"Convoy\" type mission system. It would be difficult to make it so its not a gold farming machine though.\n\nPerhaps if it were made with the same intent as the freetrader missions. Eventually you convoy from port to port and once you've compleated them all you get a nice general slot item. Maybe like \"Lead Lined Convey Armor\" specially made to escort friends and block enemy fire."}
{"text": "If you're not going to implement a decent pathfinding AI, could you at least make it so ships never warp right on top of acceleration gates and then spend five minutes fitfully crawling away from it as they try to warp? Yes - I can manually fly away and get lose faster, but this lame pathfinding is the kind of routine you'd see from a 10th grade programming class.\n\nShip's way is blocked. Try flying away at a slight angle for a couple seconds. Fly forward again. Ship's way is blocked. Try flying away at a slight angle for a couple seconds. Fly forward again. Ship's way is blocked. Try flying away at a slight angle for a couple seconds. Fly forward again. Ship's way is blocked. ... ... ... ARRRRRRGH!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nWhy is this braindead routine never replaced with some decent freaking pathfinding AI? Hell, I last programmed in Pascal ten years ago, and I could do better. We may be flying in space, but it's not all empty.\n\nFor me, the biggest problem isn't so much the path finding as much as the ridiculous collision boxes for things like the acceleration gates and asteroids. You can be a couple of km away from any solid object, but still run into their collision box, and weird things happen when collision boxes overlap or intersect (in asteroid belts, mostly).\n\nBut yes, the pathfinding needs some work. Rather than just bouncing into the object repeatedly, the ships need to be able to move an object when they run into it.\n\nAnd hey, I don't expect pathfinding around an object in the way to be as fast as flying free. Obviously being blocked plays an important role in PvP combat. But at least make ships fly slowly (75% reduction in speed when in contact with an object?) around an object in a semi-intelligent fashion, and for bonus points have objects' collision boxes better reflect their model's size (I understand the later would be a larger undertaking, but you could always tackle it model by model, a few at a time in each point upgrade).\n\nYou must have an intern or two you can put to work on this. A better pathfinding routine is hardly ground-breaking code. I know this from my own work, which is why the fantastically bad routine in Eve is so frustratingI so support this. I can't tell you how many times the pathfinder would not be able to get around an asteroid or even get away from it so I could manually do it. Oh whats best is getting stuck in the groves on an acceleration gate while you fleet members are dieing because they're in need of your help\n\nOriginally by:Idami RaptorThe whole collision code is full of related, but less obvious issues^^This.\n\nI'm not so much for a pathfinder as for collision boxes actually fitting their objects properly. Thinking I can fly close and safely pass the object then finding myself having collided with the object even though there is a clear space between it and my ship, is very annoying. Forces me to over compensate when flying past a station or whatever in order to tackle that stupid battleship on the other side.\n\nThis thread is older than 90 days and has been locked due to inactivity."}

{"text": "Best Shot at FTL?\n\nBest Shot at FTL?\n\nThe easiest thing is just to come up with some source of negative energy. We know that with negative energy some forms of time travel of feasible. Of course in real life there isn't any negative energy, but thats were fiction comes in handy.\n\nA few comments that I hope help; firstly if you haven't seen it already atomic rockets is a great resource for budding SF authors IMO (EDIT: Just saw that you have earlier up thread). It contains many pages on the various troupes of SF with advice and comments that can help you weave ideas into a story as well as containing a lot of side information to point out the effects of the causes (plot devices) e.g. if you're going to allow faster than light travel you either have to throw out causality or relativity or include some form of CPC (Larry Niven invoked the plot device that any attempt at time travel removed the reason for the journey and thus it never happens). This is also a good resource for addressing causality and other effects of FTL communication or travel. You don't have to address it of course but some readers may question it and the best SF is generally regarded as that which fully examines the effects of the plot devices and story premises. Finally on that specific topic you don't have to have FTL to make space opera as Al Reynold's Revelation Space demonstrated with its gigantic, near-light-speed travelling ships.\n\nMy second general piece of advice would be to pay considerable thought to the ecological considerations of your book. If you're going to have space habitats or ships you are going to need the technology to make closed ecosystems: environments that contain sustainable food webs capable of maintning a healthy human population. If you can't do this then either all ships and habitats will need resupply from Earth or you'll have to include further technologies that allow for resources to be scavanged in space or on other moons/planets that can be processed into nutrients for the environment. I know this sounds like a small thing but it has huge effects because if you can do it then there is no need to leave the solar system (simply build a station in space or a tented/domed settlement on a moon/planet) and if you can't do it then leaving the solar system wont solve anything. Reason being if there is an alien world out there with a biosphere it is either going to be so different as to be inhospitable; can't eat the food, can't grow crops on land with alien soil biota etc or if it is similar enough it's going to kill everyone via some immune response be it superantigenic or just simple infection from a pathogen we have no immunity for. Even if that weren't the case introducing terrestrial life to alien environments is going to have a huge effect as all cases of invasive species do. Funnily enough we had another SF author here recently who touched on this topic so rather than typing out further suggestions I'll quote my response to them;\n\nQuote by Ryan_m_b\n\nOf course as this is science fiction you could tap dance past this by either not addressing the peculiar similarity with Earth or having it that the ecosystems can't mesh so humans simply clear out areas and plant terrestrial ecosystems or have it that humans use advanced immunology to give themselves immunity to an entire alien ecosystem. I've seen examples of the latter in SF before (one example that springs to mind is a story by Ken McLeod wherein the characters wear suits that take in samples from the air and soil in the environment, run the samples through sophisticated lab on chips and then inject the occupants with rapid vaccines, after a few hours they can take off their suits safely. Given that there is some progress towards genetically engineered immune systems IRL (in HIV research no less!) this isn't so much of a stretch. You could perhaps add in some gene therapy or cell therapy for digestion too such as GM or synthetic gut flora capable of breaking down alien biomolecules.\n\nI suggest you take Mark Twain's advice,\n\"Never let the fact get in the way of a good story.\"\n\nMost of our best science fiction writers take that, marry it to the KISS principle, and produce outstanding science fiction. Take a concept or a technology as a given. Establish your own rules on how it works, and stay consistent with those rules in your story. It makes it much easier for your characters to react consistently and beleiveably.\n\nRemember, science fiction isn't about the science, it's about the people."}

{"text": "was thinking... I really kind of hate the idea of \"sacrificing\" DOFFs to feed the Hungy, Hungy Hipp-- err, Starbase. Why do we have to \"give up\" DOFFs? Will we ever be able to give up BOFFs (which seem pretty useless)? We just finished a mission where we all had to give up a bunch of green level diplomats. I think the entire fleet HATED that mission with a passion...\n\nI like 'leveling up' DOFFs through the personnel office, where I get some kind of a reward out of it and get to do better on future DOFF missions. I don't like summarily getting rid of doffs without like-form compensation, in ways that will NEGATIVELY impact my own performance on my own DOFF missions.\n\nWhat I'd kind of like to see is a set of COOPERATIVE DOFF missions for fleet starbase construction. That is, a non-destructive way to use DOFFs to complete the starbase. It \"feels\" more right. That is, we could send engineering DOFFs off to \"upgrade power conduits\" or send fabrication DOFFs off to \"build phaser turrets,\" etc. These would be kind of \"super DOFF missions,\" requiring fleet participation. It would also encourage people who would otherwise not necessarily use the DOFF system or upgrade their ranks & DOFF inventory to do so.\n\nI'd envision it as a slightly larger version of DOFF missions with maybe a few more DOFFs than the typical mission required (or just MORE MISSIONS, but similar numbers of DOFFs). Certain missions would be white level, green level, blue level and purple level, with differing levels of success/failure, etc.\n\nBasically, each fleet member could tag their DOFFs into a pool of DOFFs, from which maybe the people with permission could select the best DOFFs for the mission and assign them to get the best success percentage and/or reward bonus. Then everyone who participated gets DOFF XP out of it. This would help the fleet level up their players DOFF rankings, and it would encourage people to level up their DOFFs to better participate.\n\nPerhaps it could even give slightly better XP rewards to those whose DOFFs were assigned the mission, medium XP rewards to those who offered their DOFFs for the mission but whose weren't selected (a small 'activity bonus') and minimal or no XP for those who didn't contribute at all.\n\nMy thought is that this might make people start using the upgrade options to bump up their DOFFs to higher levels so there's a higher chance of their DOFFs being selected as \"best\" for the mission and getting the highest bonuses out the other end when it completes. And/or just make people who typically don't \"do\" doff missions actually start using the system. I have a few friends who never bothered with it that I'm having to coach through it. Seems like this might give people an incentive to learn...?\n\nIdeally, nobody would have to click \"collect rewards,\" the mission would simply complete when it completes and everyone gets their DOFFs back on reserve (rather than having to kill them off). This way nobody has to \"give up\" their favorite DOFFs to feed a hungry starbase.\n\nThat said, maybe some of the missions would have medium, high or extreme casualty risk, so there might be still some CHANCE of losing DOFFs if the mission is poorly staffed. But not a GUARANTEED loss like the current system. And, this way, fleet members won't necessarily have to make the hard decision of whether to support the fleet by killing their DOFFs or support themselves by leveling up their DOFFs (but not having the extra doffs around to \"kill off\" for the fleet). We could have it both ways (being able to help the fleet by participating in missions, but ALSO being able to bump up your own DOFFs without feeling like you're going \"Semper I, to heck with the other guy\"). Currently I'm torn between helping myself out in leveling up my DOFF ranks vs helping the fleet by sacrificing the DOFFs I'd otherwise be using to level myself up. It would be nice if we could have it both ways: being able to help the fleet, while also being encouraged to develop one's own resources. I like to have my cake and eat it too, and I feel like this would be a better solution than the current system. I feel like it would have more of a STO feel to it too. Actually completing \"missions\" rather than just resource grinding & dumping.\n\nMaybe you'd even have certain short-completion-time repeatable missions for resource grinding things like provisions or turrets, which you then use those things to complete the higher level missions. So, like, the repeatable grinding missions might be white level easy missions, which you use to get the resources to unlock the green level missions, etc. And there could even be assignment chains for some of the limited-time-missions for s/b improvements. So, you'd have to successfully complete each of the steps of the chain in order to get the improvement.\n\nAs I'm thinking about it, the grinding missions could be like \"failure, success, profitable, very profitable\" with higher payouts of the grinding materials for the different levels of critical success. Maybe critical success = you get all the 1000 provisions, profitable = you get 1/2 the stuff ~500, success, you get maybe 100. Failure, you get nothing...\n\nAnd of course, the missions could still each require things like to'duj fighters or provisions or dilithium, etc. It would just require adapting the current doff missions system and applying it to the starbase system. We already have missions in game that require brief DOFF missions as part of the mission (some of the Bajoran / DS9 missions, if I recall right?)... Why not make Starbase leveling similar to that?\n\nWhat do people think? Would this be a better solution? I think so, personally. It would treat DOFFs more like crew than like disposable commodities to perform Satanic sacrifice rituals on...\n\nIt would probably also help even out the ridiculous DOFF prices in the exchange... Since probably people wouldn't be buying up DOFFs just to dump them out of the system entirely. People would just be buying them to actually use them. Or MAYBE for leveling up. But if for leveling up, they wouldn't be making runs on SPECIFIC DOFF types, but more evenly distributing their buying, or just buying the actual USEFUL DOFFs for completing missions, and prices might once again reflect actual in-game utility rather than just which DOFFs happen to have been randomly picked as \"dump this DOFF type\" in starbase missionsI mean, if the base needs to be staffed after construction it would be easy enough to add that to the missions as like an assignment chain for actually getting the upgrade going. So, you'd maybe have \"staff the bar,\" \"staff the kitchen,\" \"staff the store\" which would be easy missions, with no chance of failure, just a requirement to give up x number of DOFFs of the proper type. Maybe staffing the kitchen would even be preceded by some of the \"prove your culinary skill\" missions, where your chefs have to actually complete the mission successfully before they can be sacrificed. Y'know, things that might actually happen as real parts of staffing a place. I mean, you don't just take your staff and shoot them all in the head out back and call the place staffed, which is about what it feels like, currentlyAgain, just my 2c.\n~MG\n\nSomeone with more spare time than I should calculate (or look up?) how many people is required to run a full \"Tier 5\" starbase, and how many DOFFs get thrown into making a \"Tier 5\" Starbase.\n\nYeah, I bet. I was torn between sacrificing a green Diplomat yesterday and selling it in the exchange for 2 mil. EC then buying about 4-5 purple Tholian DOFFs. My fleet finagled me into just tossing it into the mouth of the monster rather than going all \"Semper I\" and making a killing... *Sigh*\n\nI have to agree with the OP, I do not think its really cannon to sacrfice so many doff's and the doff's in our starship mission normally tend to return to us in good health or require some medical attention very rarely do you get a mission where they die."}

They are built to do nothing other than Destroy, Kill, Murder, Pillage, then Destroy some More, with some **** thrown in for good measure (Exception Being the Industrial Ships)\n\nI respectfully Disagree, but have a bump for good measure.\n\nHeh, thanks.\n\nBut people seldom destroy and kill for money alone. Such people are called \"pirates\", and certainly they exist, but there are also 4 whole civilizations in EVE that have their own culture, lore, life, symbolisms, etc., etc. And - they are rich, they don't have to scrimp and save to make stuff to kill.\n\nAmarr can afford gold and pointless ornamentation on their spaceships.\n\nGallente can afford flamboyant sexualized designs on their spaceships.\n\nCaldari are utilitarian because their culture is corporate/fascist (Zaibatsu) - i.e. it's an ideologically driven reason.\n\nAgain, as with the other respondent above, yes, the Minmatar could be said to answer to the philosophy you're outlining. But again, they are also proud, proud of the fact that they've broken Amarr chains and are carving out their own space.\n\nSo for all the spaceships to be Caldarified, and the avatars to be Minmatarified, just doesn't suit the lore.\n\nThis is not, and never was meant to be a simple arena PvP game, it is and was always meant to be a multiplayer Elite, with a whole, complex cultural background to the Universe, which ought to be reflected in 4 unique design philospohies and looks.\n\nIf not, then let's just chuck the whole thing in the bin ffs, forget all the virtual world building crap, let's just have a pew-pew arena with a chat lobby, with spaceships that just look totally like unimaginative, unevocative symmetrical generic movie science fiction spaceships. Who cares?\n\nBut so long as there is a virtual world in New Eden, so long as there is a lore, then I'd say it's objectively the case that the art design is falling short of what it should be to represent that - it's on track to becoming bland, homogenized, and dullWe need those useless(or were they?) visors and bad hairstyles. The Minmatar characteristic chin, that Khanid look that was almost klingonish. Outlandish clothes like the Gallente womans top that looked like clear plastic, the iconic Amarr head dress.\n\nAll these things made Eve - EVE! The styles and looks are actually just todays clothing now. T-Shirts, jackets, trousers and skirts. There is literally nothing that looks totally scifitastic any more.\n\nThe ships today I actually do like and wont complain about (apart from the new Vagas lack of ears and the police light on my Comet grrrr)\n\nBring back visual scifi, crazy hairdo's and dodgy clothes headsets, visors and head dress that look liek they 'do' have a purpose but no idea what it is. It is science FICTION, not some projection of todays stuff in a few decades time.Trust me, I almost know what I'm doing.\n\nYes, there are 4 Civilisations, and i fully agree that they should not all be the same ('Caldarified' as you put it) But remember the bitter conflict betwqeen these civilisations and everything surounding them. The Caldari hate the Gallente, are at war with Minmatar because they are allied to Gallente, and, while not at war with amarr, they do dislike them. Not to mention the Pirates (Especially Sansha) Now, back to ships and Modules (They are, after all, the basic building block of EVE) IMO, 'Goofy' would detract from the overall look and feel of EVE. Each ship should appear Menacing, in its own (Racial) Way. 'Goofy' Isnt menacing, 'Goofy' isnt a threat. 'Goofy' is silly. In my own (personal) opinion, 'goofy', while not bad, is not what EVE is. Take, for example, the Naga, and especially the Talos. Both, IMO, sucessfull Designs that Illustrate Racial philosophy. Both highly menacing, in their own different way. Neither of them are necessarily 'goofy' Now take, for example, the Moa. The Moa isnt menacing. The Moa is the height of Goofy. I Take one look at it and wonder 'Why? It could have been beautiful' As Peta Michalek said, Spaceships are Serious busness, and the designs should reflect that. I struggle to look at a Moa with a straight face, and I believe this reduces immersion. Loss of immersion is bad, and, therefore, the Moa is bad. Going back to your final paragraph in your OP - I still agree with it, but I beleive there is something Missing. Make some things look like thety have an Obvious Function Make some things look like they dont have an obvious function. Make thigns look like they could believably function, regardless of whether that function is obvious or not. Three Examples: The Talos, for one. It simply looks like it would work. Second is the Moa. It doesnt appear to be able to function properly. If it could fly at all, it would fly in circles. Third example is sort of straying from the others in that its a Turret (Alot of them, actually, but ill use one) Some of them could function properly, yes, some of them couldnt (Looking at you, 650mm Repeating Artillery) yet the vast majority looks like they would, at best, be only able to fire a few shots before running out of ammo and being unable to reload. They are goofy and non-functional because there is simply no way to reload them in space.\n\nTL;DR Some 'goofy' is good, but in limited ammounts, and ONLY when it doesnt impede beleivability and function. Even if we dont know what something is supposed to do, we should rest assured at night that it can do it. Moa is Bad.

{"text": "'s the idea. You use the crafting system and an extensive, insane, ridiculous number of mats across various levels to craft your very own ship from nacelles up to the bridge. Now obviously the ship you craft has to match one of the current in game models, so you won't be crafting a Warbird of Scimitar but more like your very own Qin Raptor or Vorcha-R. Really any model available in game could be crafted by a player, including ships currently only obtained through the Cash Shop or Emblems. Even more though, crafting your own ship from the ground up would also allow a wider range of customization, players would be allowed to move a console spot around or maybe even make changes to their bridge officer station layout finally permitting, just as an example, a Guramba with a Commander Tactical station and a Lieutenant Commander Engineering station.\n\nBut even more than that, there will be a random element to each component crafted that can cause such components to come out either commonly, uncommonly, rarely or very rarely with appropriate buffs to each one. For example, a very rare 'light warp core' could give an overall power efficiency bonus and, being a 'light warp core' would be useable on Bird of Prey and Raptor class vessels.\n\nOnto the questions!\n\nQ1. What do you mean by \"Really any model available in game could be crafted by a player, including ships currently only obtained through the Cash Shop or Emblems?\"\n\nUmm, merely that, given the power of futuristic computing and the thorough nature of futuristic scanning technology it's not unreasonable to assume working schematics for any ship in game would be available.\n\nQ2. What are you hiding?\n\nNothing, nothing I swear!\n\nQ3. \"Any model available in game can be crafted by a player...\" Wait, no, you couldn't mean \"Any model available in game can be crafted by ANY player.\" can you?\n\nMaybe I do!\n\nQ4. So you'd let the spineless dogs of the Federation craft Klingon ships!\n\nUmmm... that's not a question.\n\nQ5. Pretend it's a question and explain yourself!\n\nOkay, yes, that's right. I'd let ANY player craft ANY ship that's in game. That means a Gorn with a Deep Space Science vessel if he wants it, and that means a Vulcan with a Neghvar if that's what floats her boat. And why not? The technology is there, the resources are there and if the player base has the desire to make it happen, I say make it happen!\n\nQ6. Homogenization will be the DEATH of ALL THAT IS TREK!\n\nLets agree to disagree.\n\nQ7. But if everyone in Starfleet is flying around in a Bird of Prey then it won't be Starfleet anymore!\n\nFirst off, not everyone in Starfleet even WANTS to fly in a Bird of Prey. Secondly, you saw where I said there would be a significant cost in time and resources to craft this, I'm talking REALLY significant, like, as long as it takes you to grind up 500 emblems. So this won't be a common sight by any means. I anticipate most people will be crafting their existing ships from the ground up and min/maxing very rare ship component bonuses. And if it becomes desirable we can add an additional hurdle to crafting cross-faction ships, possibly some sort of PVP cost where rare and hard to replicate bits of technology are taken from the wreckage of felled Federation vessels.\n\nQ8. I will support NO attempts at homogenization, regardless of how awesome it may be otherwise.\n\nFine, have it your way. Assume there's an alternate proposal where a faction is restricted to crafting only their own ships.\n\nQ9. Oh, that I'm okay with.\n\nAre you sure?\n\nQ10. Well, I mean, I suppose it might create a problem with Gold farmers, they're already screwing around with the crafting economy by exploiting certain easy to farm anomalies.\n\nYeah, but crafting goes on despite that game element leading to unfortunate side effects.\n\nQ11. And then there are balance problems, I only play casually and really don't have the time to craft component after component in hopes of getting the five very rare ones necessary to craft a 'very rare' quality ship, will I still be competitive?\n\nThat's a good question. Obviously we run the risk of making the very rare ship powers too potent but that can be counter acted by putting diminishing returns on things like energy efficiency settings or power setting bonuses. Ideally, these would be no more effective than a set bonus or a long sought after bridge officer trait.\n\nQ12. Could we take current ship exclusive powers, like saucer separation or advanced transwarp, and make them something that can be crafted into other types of ships?\n\nThat's interesting... maybe. I suppose where it seems relevant and feasible sure. Like only some ships can conceivably benefit from saucer separation and the Defiant-R and Voqov Carrier are not on that list.\n\nQ13. And cloaking devices, we should be able to craft cloaking devices into ships?\n\nOh, that's a minefield I'm not sure I want to set foot in.\n\nQ14. This from the guy who's proposing even more homogenization?\n\nYou know, you're right, I might as well go in for it all. I can't think of an in-game reason why a ship, built from the ground up and to the exact specifications of a given officer, could not be built with a cloaking device. However, there's never been a Science Vessel with a cloaking device in game for good reason so, where serious game balance issues arise, arbitrary and completely unexplained restrictions against certain ship and ability combinations should be enforced.\n\nQ15. What about canon argument A, B, or C?\n\nAgainst Federation cloaking devices? Well, The Romulans are in no position to enforce canon argument A, the use of the Defiant in the Gamma Quadrant shows the Federation is at least flexible about argument B, and argument C may have held water 200 years ago in Kirk's time, but now it's just silly.\n\nQ16. Do you really believe that Cryptic has the manpower to be constantly rebalancing around user modified ships?"}
{"text": "that, at least as far as space is concerned, Tacticals, Engineers and Scientists are identical. (For GROUND combat there are big differences but for space, a Tactical and an Engineer will only differ by 1 skill per rank.)\n\nSo, tactical officer in a cruiser? Sure, why not.\n\nThe argument could be made that you should maximize your abilities, though. Attack Pattern Alpha gives you a damage buff, so the more damage you have TO buff, the more helpful it will be. With that in mind, you'd want to be in the highest DPS ship there is: an Escort.\n\nSimilarly, Engineers get Rotate Shield Frequencies, so you'd think it would make sense for them to be in the ship that gets the biggest shield bonus, which is Cruisers.\n\nBut if you tend to like hybrids, then a Tactical in a Cruiser would be giving up some DPS for some survivability. He'll still DPS better than an engineer in a Cruiser, but he won't tank quite as well."}
{"text": "Author\nTopic: Anti-starship arachnids (Read 1135 times)\n\nIn the last game I played, I captured an Anti-starship arachnid fab and build the full cap, but couldn't actually get them to attack anything. They never seem to fire on anything ever. I've tried manually targeting starships, leaving them without orders and free-roaming defender mode, but all to no avail. When manually targeting with them, it doesn't make the sound when something is targeted, so maybe something is stopping them from working.\n\nNot sure if I'm missing something with these, it's been ages since I last used them. Anybody got any ideas?Is this literally only things that could come from a Starship Constructor? I.e. they wouldn't be able to attack Mk IV Bomber Starships or Core Starships as they don't come from the constructor? That could explain some of the problems then as it was quite late on and I was trying to use them to defend against fairly high-level exo-wavesYes, I think the attack is 100,000. This sounds like a really good idea, pretty much making them into mini antimatter starship. It shouldn't really unbalance anything, and would make more sense for them to be able to shoot at other big shipsUseful tip that, thanks! I didn't realise how useful the reference tab was until I tried that. I tried having a look at this in the reference tab and counted 56 ships with the scope filter set to 'No Filter' that the arachnids did damage to, which was every starship that I could think of (including non-constructor ones) and other big ships like the Spire/Neinzul ships, but I've still not been able to get them to attack any of these. There were only 9 ships targetable if the scope filter was set to 'Ships I Can Build'.\n\nSpirecraft and Golems were not included in the list though which I suppose is fair enough, as they're not really starships haven't gotten any in a while, so I can't say. Maybe at some point the AI developed Anti-Anti-Starship Arachnids...\n\nSpirecraft and Golems were not included in the list though which I suppose is fair enough, as they're not really starshipsSort of related to tooltip issues, they currently have 6x damage against close-combat and swarmer hull types - and the reference shows none of the ships they can damage having either of those types, so those should probably just get removedI approve. Just don't call them Bomber Fighters. That would be confusing.\n\nJust remember, if they are like Bomber starships they bring 65% of the firepower of a Mark I Bomber starship at much greater range, a resource cost that is less than a Mark II Missile Frigate, a build time of 16 seconds (more than 41 times faster than a Mark I Bomber starship), and at normal caps you can have I believe 49. That is like having almost 32 extra Mark I Bomber starships.\n\nHowever, unlike bombers you can only get them from a limited facility that can easily be destroyed. You find them mid to late game. I'm sure they can be adjusted if needed, but they were deemed ok when they were first made and that was back before all sorts of cool toys were added to the game."}

{"text": "EDIT: The core proposal is revised twice in this thread. See Proposal #2, and Proposal #3 if you want to skip ahead.\n\nI did a search and read the relavant threads i could find. I'd like to propose the simplest solution i can think of that is strategicly interesting and intuitive. I'm following what seems to be the consensus that commerce should happen implicity, i.e. you don't build and control the ships that move non-military resources between planets.\n\nI've thought of elaborations, and exceptions that could reasonably be added to this, but like i said, i'm trying for the simplest intersting solution. If it doesn't allow for something of strategic value, it could be elaborated with stuff like ideas about partial blockades.\n\nI'm going to explicitly use the example of food redistribution, but i think very similar rules could be used for the redistribution of other resources, trade, military resupply (if this is implemented), and possibly even population migration. I will take into account the ownership of planets within the same system by different empires, which neccesarily complicates things.\n\nDefinitions:\nyour side = belonging to you or your allies\nuncontested = there have been no enemy fleets in the system this turn.\n\nFriendly Node: The full exchange of food occurs between planets that can be connected by an unbroken line of friendly starlane nodes. The starlane between 2 friendly nodes is colored the color of your empire (as per current version). A friendly node is a system that fulfills one of the following:\n\nNetural Nodes: Partial exchange of food occurs between planets whose connection must pass through a neutral starlane node. Partial exchange is 50% of full exchange. A neutral node is a system that fulfills one of the following:\n\n* Has not been explored by your side. * Contains planets belonging to your side, and enemies, but the enemy ships do not have uncontested control of the system.[edit: added these 2 lines] * Contains no ships or inhabited planets. * Contains only netural ships and/or planets. * Contains your side's planets, and a both your side's and enemy ships at some point in the turn. (i.e the system was contested)\n\nHostile Nodes: No exchange of food occurs between planets whose connection must pass through an enemy starlane node. An enemy node is a system that fulfills one of the following:\n\nThis would give strategic value to the shape of your empire, since divide and conquer is a more viable strategy if you can try to starve out a planet or group of planets. Building far-flung colonies becomes a calculated risk. War disrupts commerce. And it makes disolving an alliance with an neighbor who you've intermingled with a mutually damaging proposition.\n\nLast edited by eleazar on Thu May 24, 2007 10:14 pm, edited 4 times in total.Another question: do If a blockade occurs and subsequently resolved, the two systems need to establish trade again in 5 turns. The 5 turn figure would diminish as more engine/starlane/fuel techs are available.\n\nAlso, is it a consensus to treat civilian trade and military supply in the same manner?Not having \"partial exchange\" also avoids the issue of what % to make partial, (why 50%?).Alternatively, stockpiling could be non-automatic... as in you'd need to build a building to enable stockpiling, and the building's location would determine what location needs to be connected to a planet to allow that planet to make use of the stockpile. For simplicity, we'd likely only allow one location (different per resource?) to function as a stockpile centre.\n\nThat might be a bit off-topic, though the whole stockpiling / trading system likely needs to be considered together to arrive at an optimal design...\n\nSowerCleaver wrote:\n\ndoHowever it has been suggested to have the rate of supply or cost of supply change with distance for fleet resupply. ie. you'd have some max rate of supply for a fleet, and the actual rate would fall with distance of fleet from supply point.\n\nFor planet resources, likely all supply would need to be at the same rate... which is instantly fast, regardless of distances.I find this persuasive from a KISS point of view, but I also like the idea of mine-neutral-theirs for supply. This indicates that the only area in which you can operate with impunity (\"for free\", in a sense) is inside your own territory. Outside of that, you cannot get supplies nearly as easily. In enemy territory, you can't get them at all.\n\nOne the subject of cut-off partial empires, I think that subempires should be able to produce and distribute supply and resources as before, but just not stockpile anything. This discourages fragmentation (and makes it an option for attackers), and dramatically reduces the UI and micro burden of having lots of stockpiles to keep track of. Restricting resource distribution to the planet or system of origin is too much, IMO, since I think this is a simplifying rule that would be extremely frustrating as a player (\"There's a surplus right here, but they're starving right next door!\", etc.).\n\nThis second bullet point indicates that a neutral node can contain neutral planets, and the third one indicates that it cannot. Was this just miswritten slightly, or did you mean something I'm not getting?Geoff the Medio wrote:\n\nI don't see a need to have a concept of \"partial exchange\".The game doesn't need \"neutral nodes,\" but IMHO the minimal increase in complexity is justified by the increase in strategic interest. It sort of an ad-hoc garrison. Commerce to multiple outlying colonies can be partially disrupted by destroying a garrison, or blockading a strategic system. In an \"open/closed\" system described above, the only way to disrupt commerce to a group of planets is to completely surround them. Of course completely blocking commerce is the same in either proposal.\n\nFrom a GUI perspective, the colored lines drawn between adjacent systems that you control, were a far too obvious and elegant item, for me to avoid thinking of game-state information for them to communicate.\n\nAlso it seemed too lenient that battle in a system would not disrupt commerce, and too harsh that battle completely disrupted commerce. So i proposed a half-way state.Geoff the Medio wrote:The above approach seems congruent with the previous design decisions like the global production queue. It's also pretty simple. It's my preference. AlternativelyGeoff the Medio wrote:\n\nSowerCleaver wrote:This second bullet point indicates that a neutral node can contain neutral planets, and the third one indicates that it cannot. Was this just miswritten slightly, or did you mean something I'm not getting?\n\nEach of the 3 points are independant descriptions of a \"friendly node.\" I don't mean the 3 points to be cumulative. Does that clear it up?\n\nI edited the first post for clarity, and added a condition to take into account a system where enemies both own some planets.\n\nItsort of an ad-hoc garrison.\n\nNeeding to \"fill space\" with ships to have efficient intra-empire resource exchange is appealing. It gives a purpose to have roving groups of fast attack / long range cruisers that can take out an enemy's behind-the-front-lines space-filling sentry ships, but which would be too weak to fare well against powerful but slow-moving main battle fleets. It also gives a way to disrupt commerce with groups of cloaked ships in a similar role that doesn't involve magically creating a group of freighters for them to battle...\n\nThat said, much of the same results could be had by requiring all resource sharing to be along secured routes. Presumably those freighter captains don't like risking unprotected routes. Sounds a bit harsh compared to what's been assumed, but it might work...\n\nAlso, regarding partial sharing, it's not clear how it would work. You say that (perhaps) 50% sharing is allowed. What does that mean exactly? The planet can export 50% of its surplus, or get 50% of it's needed imports for locally-produced things? That would imply a planet can import more if it's building more, which doesn't make much sense.\n\nIt might make more sense to talk about partial import restrictions if we had a larger system of import limits, unrelated to just blockades. ThereQuote:\n\nAlso it seemed too lenient that battle in a system would not disrupt commerce, and too harsh that battle completely disrupted commerce.\n\nI think it's reasonable to block civilian shipping through systems in which battles are occurring...\n\nQuote:ThereI can understand why it would seem unfair to build a shipyard on the other side of the galaxy, and then start pumping ships out with the full industrial force of an empire far away. However that is can be dealt with using my concept. If there's no netrual or friendly path to the shipyard, it can only produce ships with the resources of the connected planets (if any).Quote:I'm pretty sure that when he said \"supply depot\" he was thinking about a way to store resources.Agreed.\n\nWill population immigrate with instantaneous speed also? If so, what prevents a player from depleting 20 pop planet to 0 pop in a single turn when the enemy armada is approaching? If not, why the difference? Since all ships move FTL on starlane, I don't think the acceleration/brake time should affect the ship speeds measured in turns(presumably years).\n\nAlso, note that this is not something a player should keep track and micromanage constantly. Actually there's nothing a player can do about this other than researching engine techs. Therefore I don't think abstracted supply (no freighters flying around) logically has to be instantaneously on-off.\n\nThe game play value of this is that it takes longer for your pop to grow from 1 to 2 if you settle farther from your closest colony. Since it adds a factor to consider in deciding where you settle your colony and does not require microing, the only down side of this is coding complexity, I think.\n\nQuote:Another alternative is trying to choose the most important factor and disregard other factors. For example, we can calculate the % by simply comparing the \"power\" ratings of the two fleets.\n\nWill population immigrate with instantaneous speed also? If so, what prevents a player from depleting 20 pop planet to 0 pop in a single turn when the enemy armada is approaching?.\n\nFrom what i've read players will usually not be able to instantly evacuate a planet. However, the question of \"why\" and \"when\" the migration of populations happens is a matter for a different topic. However the possible destinations of population could be determined by my first post here.\n\nIf you wish to argue for time-delayed redistribution, please explain how it's more fun or more stategicly interesting, or even easier on the AI. The fact that it may be more \"logical\" or \"realistic\" is a very weak recommendation for this game.\n\nNo, there would be a limit on the rate of population transferred each turn, however the transfer would start or stop instantly with no delay between it disappearing from one system and when it appears at another system.\n\nQuote:\n\nThe game play value of this is that it takes longer for your pop to grow from 1 to 2 if you settle farther from your closest colony.\n\nThe rate of migration calculation can depend on distance to sink from source.\n\nThe fact that it may be more \"logical\" or \"realistic\" is a very weak recommendation for this game.\n\nI agree.\n\neleazar wrote:\n\nIf you wish to argue for time-delayed redistribution, please explain how it's more fun or more stategicly interesting, or even easier on the AI.\n\nStrategic implications from instantaneous redistribution:\n\n- it takes longer for your initial colony pop to grow if you settle farther from your closest colony (if no migration is involved).\n- it further rewards races investing in engine/fuel/starlane techs.\n- (partial) blockades are more painful; the victim is further motivated to fight blockades rather than sit through.\n\nWhether these strategic implications justify the coding complexity is a fair question, but instantaneous redistribtion seems oversimplified to me.\n\n\u2022 It's harder for the computer to know how much to ship.\nThere are no stockpiles on individual planets. So if planet B needs food, and planet A has extra, planet A sends out an invisible ship with X amount of surplus food to B. Suppose it takes 5 turns for the food to get there. In the meantime:\n\nB may no longer need the food, in which case it will be sent somewhere else? The enemy fleets may conquer additional systems, possibly causing the invisible transport to go the long way around, or to be boxed into a corner. If the transport gets boxed in or forced along a longer route, does the auto-economy send another transport or hope the first one gets through? Will the computer be able to predict a outlying system's shortfall before it happens?\n\n\u2022 It's harder for the player to know what's going on.\nThe whole point of invisible transportation, is so the player doesn't have to manage it. However, if you have an unknown quantity of goods tied up in transport, which will arrive at an uncertain point in the future, the invisibility becomes a problem. The amount of resources you will have next turn becomes hard to predict.\n\n\u2022 It's harder to code. Since playtesters won't directly see the redistribution it will be hard to figure out what kind of weaknesses the redistribution AI has.\n\nWho is online\n\nYou cannot post new topics in this forum You cannot reply to topics in this forum You cannot edit your posts in this forum You cannot delete your posts in this forum You cannot post attachments in this forum"}

Tradeoff is 2/3's uptime on three systems vs. 100% uptime on two, but freeing up an engineering slot makes it worth it. I use EPtA, EPtW, and EPtS on Jorfaid."}
{"text": "To Konrads points, being able to see the detailed casuality breakdown AFTER your opponents turn in the TOTALS report would be nice.\n\nFighter escort isn't automatic like interception, but they can be made part of the formation doing the airdrop or transport, and will engage any interceptoring fighters. Of course, that acts as a mission (AP's, fuel, etc) for them, so they're no longer at full range."}
{"text": "Reload is a diminishing returns attribute. Put on two 8.75% reload mods and you'll see that you got less than 17.5% speed bonus. I haven't figured out exactly how it works cause everytime I calculate it, it doesn't match what I think it should, but it seems to be clear that reload has diminishing returns, maybe even more than it seems like it mathematically should.\n\nBasically 100% reload bonus would decrease your reload time in 50%, that is the cap.\n\nThe way I read it, a 25% reload bonus would decrease reload time by 20%.\n\nReload SPEED = 125% therefore reload TIME = 80%.\n\nYes?\n\nErrrr...

{"text": "are being boarded.\n\nHas anyone out there actually been boarded yet? By that I mean; does the AI use the new boarding sysem or is it just the player? You can invest in all these new security systems like internal defence lasers, marines, hull polarization and firewalls but are they actually of any use?\n\nAs far as I know - please correct me if I'm wrong - the only ships to use barding pods are missile M7's and the pirates don't have any. One of the things I was looking forward to was dealing with my frigate being boarded by pirate mercenaries but I don't see any sign of that ever happening. It's even strongly hinted at in the game manual, have I been misled?"}
{"text": "Progress Report: Strangely, with my hurry to get as much done as possible before summer sets in, Episode 5 is already more than halfway complete. Data and tactical maps are in, as is 95% of the post game content; really, the only things left are the final encounter and ending sequences. Looks like I'll be able to polish it up a bit before its late July release date after all. Speaking of which, here is a brief list of things I want to add but am making absolutely no guarantee that I will before the next episode, so stay your pitchforks:\n\nRight now, there is no difference in a Quality 1 X-Type property protection and a Quality 10 one. I would like to add an additional defense boost to the type (either Hull, Systems, or Pilot) for higher quality ones. This wouldn't be retroactive, and I can't guarantee that it will be plausible, but it's something I will consider.\n\nSpeaking of defenses, it seems like defense stats start meaning less and less after about Episode 2 as enemy skill levels get higher and higher. I might retool the damage formula - if not for enemies, then at least for player defenses. It's a dangerous move this late in the game's lifecycle, but it might be a necessary one.\n\nI promised an e-bro that I'd see into making a \"sticky\" cursor in battle that remembered and automatically selected your last weapon choice. I had this half-working, but a quirk in the processing events means I'd have to inject a fix into every battle map in the game (of which there are probably around 50). I'll also have to make a kiosk to let the player turn it on or off. Maybe I'll get to that eventually?\n\nI also wanted to add a menu option in the tactical screen to pop up the mission objective as a reminder. However, some missions have objectives that change halfway through, and any that have special objectives usually have a counter or some other interface-based reminder on-screen anyway, so this one is kind of low priority.\n\nLastly, a couple of folks asked about a \"low performance\" mode that removed flourishes like scrolling backdrops and whatnot. Kind of a slog to implement, but feasible. I'll see what I can do.\n\nSince the dawn of Unix time, weapons have been the most common \"interface\" to the game world by far. Almost every game ever made has been rooted in a primal desire to kill, or destroy, or stomp, or trap in a tiny bubble and pop. And because of this, the choice of or powering-up of weaponry is a staple gameplay element, if not the primary strategy itself. It's kind of strange to think about the conduit between the player's actions and the game world being distilled into one little white rectangle of pixels, but here we are. Sure, there might be secondary tools or abilities for situational use, but if you were to simplify all input to an Atari 2600's joystick, you better believe the lone action on that red button is gonna be \"attack.\"\n\nWhy, then, do so many RPGs play \"follow the leader\" with their weapon selections, as opposed to trying something new? It's actually kind of funny; the earliest RPGs expressed weapons in the simplest of terms: varying levels of \"attack power,\" whatever that means, and maybe accuracy too. Real-life weapons are situational, cultural, and completely pragmatic in their own ways, but few if any games really translate this into a strategically interesting manner.\n\nThe simplest handling of weapons is as I said before - \"attack power goes up.\" This is about as displaced from reality as you can get, but most of the time it's part of the adaptation of the escalation of power that many RPGs call \"progress.\" After all, shouldn't a solid gold sword worth 10,000 G's cut better than a steel one worth 1,000? It's all numbers. Numbers go up, player gets a mild euphoric rush that lasts until the next tier of enemies is encountered, and the cycle repeats. The weapon itself - a knight sword, a bo staff, a pair of kitchen knives - makes no discernible change on gameplay except for maybe a different combat animation or icon on the equipment screen. It's a name, a number, and a price, and that's it.\n\nThe next step up is forced diversity. Every character or character class specializes in exactly one type of weapon, but this is entirely for flavor, and all it means to the player is having to scroll down and buy one of each weapon instead of just buying 4 broadswords and moving on. This sort of goes hand-in-hand with the concept of weapon \"skills\" and \"specializations\" found in many western-style and strategy RPGs, but there is still no diversity to be had. Thieves use daggers, because the games in the previous generation deigned it so; the generic \"Attack\" command remains exactly as-is, regardless. Skill rating is just another number, and you're purposefully gimping yourself if you choose to wield a hammer instead.\n\nA slight step up from this is secondary effects on weapons. Maybe that hammer grants +1 to sneaking skill? Okay, it doesn't make much sense, but, magic! Unfortunately, the problem here is that these sorts of weapons tend to just amplify the effects of the classes they're meant for. You'll find daggers with +5% to Backstab skill, which are useless to everyone but thieves anyway, so any attempts at a creative loadout are stifled from the get-go, and you've got that \"illusion\" of diversity yet again which I've ranted upon numerous times. Skyrim is great fun, but it does this to a disturbing degree, even with armor. So, even though it's a supposedly classless system, you're already being railroaded into the plain vanilla prerequisite abilities of the fighter/mage/thief class system if you want to get the most out of your character.\n\nFinally, finally, we get to actual differences between different weapon classes, either in equipment restrictions or damage \"types.\" A two-handed sword means your forfeit a shield; everyone knows that. Unfortunately, this instance more often than not is reliant on whether the game's own balance means the difference in damage output is worth forfeiting blocking opportunities. Sometimes it is; sometimes it is not; the only way to know is trial and error, and by that point you've invested enough points into one branch or the other than you may regret your decision. Polearm weapons may have a lot more reach than daggers, but this is almost universally pointless; you'll get maybe one extra attack with that polearm before the enemy is up in your face (most AIs aren't ready to handle any actions more complex than \"rush in and attack\"), so the faster attack speed of the dagger basically trumps all. This is especially noticeable when damage caps are in play, especially by late-game - you will always, ALWAYS choose the weapon that gets more hits in per period, regardless of other factors. Ranged weapons meet a similar fate, almost always with damage reductions to compensate for the initial lack of danger (except for stealthy or \"snipe\" attacks).\n\nThen, there's the good old \"crush/edge/pierce\" weapon \"element\" triangle (guilty, of course). Weapons may innately be one of the three, and certain enemies will resist or be more vulnerable to certain types. However, in practice, this almost never makes an appreciable enough difference to be a consideration, and worse yet, sometimes designers may throw it in without really considering the weapons in play - knights almost always use swords, while healers almost always use crushing weapons, so if your only mace-wielding character is not suitable for melee combat, then that 25% boost in damage is going to be worthless anyway. It should be less of a balancing act and more of an integration into many factors of gameplay - the characters, the enemies, the weapon availability, and the sacrifice of a turn of attacking instead of doing some other action. Plus, when you get right down to it, it's still just a number. Granted, when I implemented such a triangle in TR, it was part of the philosophy of enemies being slightly randomized enough that there were many potential actions a player could take in a turn, but likely only one \"best\" action. Sometimes that may be clubbing a bug with a hard shell; sometimes that may be zapping it with lightning. The damage difference was significant enough to make it less of an afterthought. The Fire Emblem games mostly do this well, too.\n\nA subset of this is \"elemental\" weapons; they are generally useful for exactly one dungeon or boss fight, and never again, and there is usually maybe one weapon for each element in the entire game. Seems like an extreme waste of code to me, especially since I tend to just go non-elemental anyway for fear of getting caught with my pants down and inexplicably healing the enemy when attacking it. There is also the matter of \"enchanting\" weapons with elements, which is almost always a wasted action as well, except against particularly devious bosses.\n\nFinally, the top echelon of RPG weapons is almost exclusive to action RPGs - different weapons have different swing styles, speeds, reach, attack patterns, and (ugh) skills or finishing moves. The problem here - if you could call it that - is that it's less of a strategic choice and more of a playstyle preference. Some people like to exploit dodge mechanics and use huge, powerful strikes at a steady rate. Some people like to block and counter. Some people just \"kite\" enemies with arrows and never take a direct hit. Variety is always nice, but oddly enough, weapons within the genre itself have basically stagnated to the degree that any quirks or variances between titles are minor at best. And they still all achieve the same end - put out as much damage while taking as little as possible. Modern-setting games with projectile weapons are no different. The four or so weapons we got in Wolfenstein 3D have been repeated ad nauseum for 20+ years, and the subtle differences that designers incorporate for that \"realism\" sense aren't necessarily a good idea from a game design standpoint.\n\nIt's time for something new. If weapons aren't going to go all the way in making real-world sense, then, why keep repeating the same trick over and over? Is it gamer complacency? Ugh, gamers ruin everything. Anyway, why not have a light sword play different from a battle ax, either by way of \"Attack\" command or swinging animation? Why the oversimplification of \"damage versus defense\" as pure numbers? What if, when I miss with that ax swing, the blade gets embedded in the ground and I have to expend stamina pulling it out while being open to attack? Game balance seems to center around trade-offs, but right now those trade-offs seem to be \"attack speed versus attack power\" and that's it. The counterargument, I guess, is that gamers don't want to deal with micromanagement and just want to hammer on the R1 button. Demon's Souls and its followup get it half-right - weapons have distinct attack patterns that need to be learned and exploited, and doing something stupid like trying to use a huge two-hander inside of an enclosed tunnel just makes the blade bounce off the walls, which makes logical sense. Too bad the rest of the game amounted to NES-platformer style memorization, but it was a step in the right direction.\n\nSorry for such a long rant. I recently tried Gothic 3 off Gamefly, and immediately upon seeing the sword-swinging animation in that game and realizing that the developers thought \"yep, this is a high-quality production easily worth $60 USD\", I had to explore the issue in general and vent some. Maybe some day, I'll actually implement a design choice in one of my own games that runs counter to what I rant about on the internet!\n\nNext time: Stop saying you want to make an MMO, people! You have no idea what kind of pain you're about to bring upon yourselves!"}
{"text": "noticing, recently, that a lot of people are flying Cruisers. A LOT. Specifically the Odyssey. For every Escort or Science Vessel I see, I could count 5 Cruisers. And, out of those 5 Cruisers, odds are at least ONE of them is an Odyssey. Usually, it'll be 2 or 3 (to the community's credit, that used to be a lot higher). People always complain that they tun slowly, so why are they BY FAR the most popular ship type in Starfleet? Well, let's examine each type, shall we?\n\nSECTION 1: AVAILABILITY.\nA big reason of this would be the SELECTION. Let's tale a look at the Playable Starship table over at STOWiki. I'm not going to get into the Fleet Ships, those are just buffed rehashes of what we had before. At lieutenant, we have 4 ships. The Oberth is the Science Vessel (C-Store only), the NX is the Escort (C-Store only), and there are TWO cruisers at this tier (one is C-Store only). The trend has already emerged. If we follow that chart down, the status quo doesn't change. One ship each, then the Retrofit off the C-Store. This is the same for Lt. Cmdr, Cmdr, and Captain.\nThen we hit Admiral, and the status quo packs it's bags and heads for the hills. Two Escorts (no C-Store versions), 4 Science Vessels (2 C-Store only)... and FIVE Cruisers (2 non-C-Store, one straight purchase, and 2 C-Store Gamble ships). At VA, ALL ships are C-Store (I, however, remember getting my Fed Sci his free Intrepid Retrofit when he hit VA - they need to re-add that). Five MORE cruisers to three Escorts and TWO Science Vessels.\nThe grand total is as follows:\nGetting the Bronze in this category is the Science Vessels, with only 11 variants. The silver goes to the Escorts, with 12. Getting the gold is, of course, the CRUISER, at a whopping EIGHTEEN variants of the lumbering giants. So, they get a point. There's more cruisers than other ships, but no cruiser is a Carrier. Odd.\n\nSECTION TWO: STATS.\nFor the purpose of standardized comparison, I'll be using the Assault Cruiser, the Advanced Escort, and the Reconnaissance Science Vessel. We'll start off with the most obvious stuff: Power Bonuses. Everyone should know these. Cruisers get +5 to all, Escorts get +15 weapons, and Science Vessels get +15 Aux. So, Escorts hurt more, Science uses more powers, and the Cruisers just balance. That should mean Escorts should win.\nThe next piece of obvious piece is Base Turn Rate. The Assault Cruiser does 7 degrees per second. The Recon Science Vessel gets 13 d/S, and the Advanced Escort peels off with 15 d/S. So, Escorts turn better.\nTechnobabble enthusiast will understand the next stat already: Shield modifiers. This is the number your base shield capacity gets multiplied by before bonuses get applied to give you your base shield on that ship. Cruisers, in this case, are the baseline, with a shield modifier of 1. This means, with NO boosts, if a shield says 5,000 capacity, you get 5,000 capacity. On the low end are the Escorts, at 0.9. With no boosts, a shield saying 5,000 on the tooltip will only get you 4,500. So, the Escorts have something of a deficit in the shields department. Science Vessels, however, gain a big ol' 1.3 modifier. This means that a tooltip that says 5,000 will net you 6,500 instead. They can pull their weight in shields. Science Vessels take the cake here.\nFinally, it's time for the real gap... Base Hull. The short stick got pulled by the Recon Science Vessel, she only has 27,000. The Advanced Escort, endeavoring to be the middle child, sits on a firm 31,000. A modest difference, an Escort can take an extra torpedo. However, the Assault Cruiser ate too many cakes in its youth, and sits on a fat 39,000. So, for eating too much cake, the Cruiser gets another one.\nSo, in this category, everyone meets up pretty evenly. No points here.\n\nSECTION 3: POTENTIAL POWERS.\nThis section is all about BOffs. What kind of powers can your lackeys slot in? I'll continue with the base ships from Section Two.\nThe Advanced Escort has 7 Tactical power slots, 2 Engineering power slots, and 3 Science power slots. This is clearly a damage spec. Those tactical slots could be firing every gun 9001 times a second. They bring pain.\nThe Recon Science vessel has 7 Science power slots, 3 Tactical power slots, and 2 Engineering power slots. This guy is gonna make things WEIRD. Black holes and subspace tears will appear all OVER the place! This ship flies in and turns the fight into an episode of the Twilight Zone.\nBut the Assault Cruiser... the number of frakks given by the Assault Cruiser is negative. This big bucket of bolts is bursting with 7 Engineering powers, 3 Tactical powers, and two Science powers. This guy can bring every healing and resistance power known to MAN. The damage from the Escort can just be healed back, and the Science Vessel is wasting its efforts.\n\nSUMMARY\nSo, we've looked at the ships. They've all got their niche. However, the winning of the Cruiser has become apparent. They're too much like real-life Tanks... take ALL the enemy fire and still have the ability to blow enemies sky high. Plus, there are more varieties of Cruiser. Overall, it's a lot stronger, especially considering that late-game enemies (the Borg) have a lot of durability AND damage, requiring them to be tanked. So, how can the other ships come up to par?\nFor one, there could stand to be a few more Escorts. They're small, Starfleet should have no trouble producing them. They could also stand to gain a passive, like the Science Vessels having Subsystem Targeting and Sensor Scan. Maybe, Escorts could get B:Faw, B:O, C:Rapid, and C:Scatter for free, with a special passive for Strafing runs (first consecutive volley deals 5% more damage, only reactivates on a weapon after that weapon has not fired for 7 seconds, plus a bigger Defense boost while moving).\nScience Vessels are a good mid-ground for ships; they can take a decent beating, they can have the highest shields in the game, and they cam make things wonky. They have a passive, and an ability gain. Their main issue is that they don't have the damage they need unless it's a long, drawn-out 1-on-1. But, they're decently well-balanced and good in a select few situations. There could be a few more of them, too. the way it is the game will become unplayable because no-one will have the lifespan (in case of escorts) or damage (In case of cruisers) or both (in case of science ships) to kill anything.\n\nI thought the OP was just observing that the most popular ships seem to be cruisers by federation players?\n\nEither way..\n\nMy observation has been kinda similar, when it comes to startfleet players I've noticed these\n\n-most are in cruisers\n-most dont know how to fly them\n-most lose a shield facing in pvp and use science/engineering team as opposed to tactical team\n-Most are flown by tactical captains\n\nMy guess for all these reasons?\nFanatics.\n\nThey go tactical because they like the idea of blowing things up, but dont realise they trade survivability. They choose cruisers because they are the ship of the captain/series they like e.g. Exploration cruiser (i mean why else is the like 4re-fits for one flipping vessel.) Soverign (the movies), or they think a cruiser can sufficently tank by spamming engineering and science teams.\n\nAs for the oddesy it might be the psychological thing of 'the most expensive thing is the best' and if i get this, i will be better at the game. Which makes me giggle when I'm in a stf (a Science captain in an escort) and I end up being the one supporting cruisers with AuxTSIF, and hazard emitters.\n\nAlso to say for cruiser's popularity some cruisers are 'iconic' ships that some people just feel compelled to buy, e.g. excelsior (i myself bought it and barely used it past a week) the way it is the game will become unplayable because no-one will have the lifespan (in case of escorts) or damage (In case of cruisers) or both (in case of science ships) to kill anything.\n\nRant over...\n\n33k... not bad... But my Odyssey build can take that. Like I said in the third part, Cruisers do a REALLY good job at sucking up damage. I pop Eng Team 3 and Miracle Worker... What damage? A seriously tank-specced cruiser is an unstoppable force. I once tanked a Tactical Cube in Infected Normal for 5 minutes... with its forward side facing me. Torpedoes, cannons, I took everything it had for WELL long enough for the rest of my team to take down the gate (which was my intention - you don't wanna take pod shots at the gate with a Tac Cube trying to snipe you)... and I did this BEFORE I perfected the build. An Elite Tactical Cube... that's another matter, but I still took his fire for a good 90 seconds. Between Reverse Shield Polarity 3, Eng Team 3, Miracle Worker, and my Borg set... I'm a GOOD tank.\n\nIf you'd like, I can give you the build. I simulated it on STOAcademy.\n\n\"They could also stand to gain a passive.. Maybe, Escorts could get B:Faw, B:O, C:Rapid, and C:Scatter for free, with a special passive for Strafing runs. \"\n\nWell... no, as you said they have 7 + or - tactical boff seats, weapon modifying abilities are what these are for...\n\n\"But, they're decently well-balanced and good in a select few situations.\"\n\nThat's arguable, science abilities keep getting nerfed or \"fixed\", science ships are tanks and crowd control (good for pve not pvp), most of abilities have been declawed at one point or another, but yeah in the right hands they can still be used well.\n\n\"There could be a few more of them, too.\"\n\nThat's really down to the players, if they want to fly them, they will, if they dont then they dont fly them :p, its not like there is a quota of how many types of ship there must be in game ^^\n\nThe reason for the numerical dominance of cruisers lies probably in the nature of star trek itself.\nStar Trek has always been a Cruiser dominated Universe. Before the introduction of the Defiant, \"escort\" class ships where next to unknown on Starfleet side. Cruisers on the other hand are the much more iconic type of ships in the Star Trek universe.\n\nYou know, before the Dominion War, Star Trek was about exploring the universe in ships which where able to do 5 or even 10 year missions. They had to be able to take care of themselves, without relying on other ships backing them up or providing firepower for them. Thats what i essentially expect from a Star trek game, i want to fly big ships that don't need \"escorts\" to destroy an enemy effectively.\n\nPersonally i would have prefered if they never introduced the Defiant in the first place. I think that such a type of ship doesn't belong to Starfleet or the Star Trek universe at all. I find the very idea of small agile glass cannons in Star Trek greatly inappropriate and improper IMO.\n\nIn my opinion:\nIn STO, Cruisers should dominate space battles with their firepower and survivability, while Science ships provide crowd control and other \"magic\" stuff.\nDoing fast dogfights and zipping around just isn't Star Trek for me, if i want to do that i play other games set in other sci fi universes. In STO Space combat should be more tactical oriented instead of those fast paced dogfights we have in STO.\n\nOne, cruisers are much more iconic so it makes sense that people playing for 'Trekness' would largely pick them. And the Odyssey is officially 'The Flagship,' whether its actually better or not.\n\nTwo, have you played much endgame? Cruisers are numerous, but escorts rule the roost already (and definately don't need buffing). I play cruisers and sci because escorts bore me, but numerically my escorts are a heck of a lot more effective than anything else."}
{"text": "Why should it use square of the radius? If it isn't just going to use radius, it should use cube of radius since ships are three dimensional objects?\n\nIt's not so much about realism as balance. If you add up all the radiuses of ships in a cap, you tend to get much lower totals for low-cap ships than for high-cap ships. So it's much harder to boost the attacks of a cap of high-cap ships. If you instead look at the squares of ships' radiuses, the total per cap is approximately independent of cap size. (There's great variation between ship types, but those are the trends.) This is the point I was ineloquently trying to make in this post a while ago. The graphs show that a cap of high-cap ships should be just as easy to boost as a cap of low-cap ships (on average), but this contradicts players' experience.\n\nAnyway, when I get some time I'll try and set up a little experiment with carefully chosen starting bonus ships against 1/1 Turtles, and try to confirm my hunch. (Or anyone's welcome to beat me to it!)\n\nI just corrected the Armor Boosters entry on the TZR page and updated a number of other entries; if someone with wiki access can think of a good description for the nanoswarm (or just copy the game's one) to replace the Mimic entry I'd appreciate it\n\nWhile we're on radiuses, I've a strong hunch the number of ships a booster can boost is actually being calculated based on the ships' radiuses, rather than the squares of their radiuses. When I get time I'll try to create a save that demonstrates thisI can Mantis this if desired.\n\nNo need to mantis in this case, I'd actually intended those behaviors to be impacted too but I guess it didn't work out that way; will put on list for next release; thanks for pointing it out.\n\nSorry, I should have been clearer: what I've experienced is a Neinzul Enclave Starship dropping its drones due to the first Fallen Spire shard thingy, which at present does count as an enemy ship. I'm not sure whether SFGPs and CSGs cause the same behaviour; I'd just assumed they would as the patch notes didn't state otherwise.\n\nSpecial Forces Guard Posts and Core Shield Generators are now never counted as Attack or Threat on the top bar, since players commonly leave them as-is and they're (relatively) innocuousJust a heads-up to all that I've started a new compilation of text problems at Keith's request: Mantis 0011485. Feel free to add to it, or suggest here and I can add. I think it makes life easier for the devs to consolidate them like this, plus it helps avoid duplicate reports.\n\nDoes anyone know if there's a way to close old Mantis reports? Mantis 9307 is already done, and Mantis 6523 was long ago made redundant by intervening changes.\n\nI'm not sure which I find more befuddling, the fact you gave an answer already given by Chris, or the fact you just answered a question posed in 2010\n\nI don't want to rob you of your critical reading skills by explaining.\n\nSorry if I sounded rude. Last time I saw such a break in a thread it was because someone had responded to a post by a sophisticated spambot, which was subsequently deleted. I'd just thought something similar might have happened here.\n\nSo previously, Sniper Turrets got a higher attack bonus against Raid Starships (UltraLight hulls) than most other ships. I think that meant they would tend to auto-target Raid Starships ahead of most other targets based on the usual logic about maximising damage (not certain because I used to target them manually). And that's what you want, as Raid Starships are incredibly dangerous, and their radar dampening, immunities, and high armor mean Sniper Turrets are one of the few defenses that are effective against them. But now, Sniper Turrets get the same bonus against Raid Starships as against a variety of other common targets. So do they still preferentially target Raid Starships, or have we inadvertently made them \"dumber\"? Would it be worth slightly increasing their bonus vs. UltraLight hulls to improve their \"intelligence\"?\n\nIf you press tab to bring up the galaxy map, you can select a filter near the bottom of the screen that will show you which planets contain champion wormholes. I think it's called \"Nebula wormholes\", which is the proper name for them."}
{"text": "Quote: You can find them in the Core rule books. Not sure if they have a free download for the construction rules.\n\nThere are no construction rule free (legal) downloads. You can download .pdf copies of the core books, including Tech Manual (construction rules for many vehicle types), from various online RPG retailers.\n\nI can provide a summary here, though. Construction is based on BattleMech rules, with the following exceptions:\n\nYou only can use \"IndustrialMech (IM) Internal Structures,\" not endosteel or other fancy structures. IM structures are 20% of the IM's mass. A 100-ton 'Mech thus has a 20-ton structure. IMs can be quad mechs, but not omnis.\n\nIndustrialMech movement and engine rating are found the same way as BattleMechs, with the following engine options: standard fusion, internal combustion, fuel cell, and fission. XL, light, and compact fusion are not available. Internal combustion engines are twice as heavy as a standard fusion engine (SFE) of the same rating; fuel cell engines are 20% heavier than a SFE of the same rating, round up to the nearest half ton; and fission engines are 75% heavier than a SFE of the same rating, round up to the nearest tonnage. ICEs come with 600km of fuel by default, and fuel cells have 450km by default.\n\nIndustrialMechs need gyros like BattleMechs. They may only use standard gyroscopes.\n\nIndustrialMechs may have jump jets, but only if they're fission or fusion powered.\n\nIndustrialMech basic cockpits are 3 tons. They are simpler than BattleMech cockpits, suffering a +1 to all attack rolls and lacking ejection seats. Those shortcomings may be fixed with \"Advanced Fire Control\" (a 0-ton, cost-increasing item) and an ejection seat (0.5 tons, 1 crit). Without Advanced Fire Control, IMs cannot use a lot of fancy electronics (Artemis, C3, etc.)\n\nIndustrialMechs, by default, are creatures of the air and ground. They die in vacuums and underwater. (I think they can wade in depth 1 water, but don't quote me.) Some people like IMs in vacuum, so they can get Environmental Sealing. It is 10% of the IM's mass, rounded up to the nearest full ton. It requires 8 crits at 1 crit per location (each arm, each leg, each torso, and the head, which makes it impossible to mount an ejection seat and environmental sealing together.)\n\nIMs may not use standard Triple Strength Myomers; there is an \"industrial TSM.\" It is 0 tons and 12 crits.\n\nIMs build up heat EXACTLY like BattleMechs EXCEPT - and this is the only exception - that they do not build up heat from walking or running. This means missile weapons and ballistic weapons build up heat on IMs, just like BattleMechs. On the flip side, IMs do use a heat scale - they don't have to be heat-neutral. If you give an industrialmech a PPC and 3 heat sinks, it's quite legal, just dumb. You could even put a PPC on an ICE IndustrialMech with 0 heat sinks, but it would never cool off. (Speaking of that, ICEs and, as I recall, fuel cells do add some new \"fuel explosion\" risks to the heat scale.)\n\nIndustrialMechs may built with only single strength heat sinks. Internal combustion engines come with 0 free heat sinks; fuel cells have 1 free heat sink; fission engines have 5 free heat sinks; and fusion engines have 10 free heat sinks. As with BattleMechs, you can \"hide\" some heat sinks in the engine, at 1 per 25 rating points regardless of engine type. If you built an IM with a 240-rated fuel cell engine (1 free heat sink) and added 10 extra single heat sinks (11 total), you would put 9 in the engine and would have to find critical slots for the other 2.\n\nIndustrialMechs may use one of 3 types of armor: Heavy Industrial, Industrial, and Commercial. IndustrialMechs have the same armor limits as BattleMechs, in terms of points. The three armor types:\n\n\"Heavy Industrial\" is a fancy way of saying, \"standard 16 points/ton BattleMech armor.\"\n\nFor industrial armor, you pick the tons you want, multiply by 16, and before you get happy and write that down you multiply the points by 0.67, rounded down to the nearest whole number. So if you gave your IndustrialMech 3.5 tons of armor, you'd end up with 3.5 x 16 x 0.67 = 37 points. This means a 100-ton bipedal IM may mount way over 19 tons of armor to get the maximum 307 points of protection.\n\nCommercial armor, on the other hand, gives 24 points per ton. Before you go, \"Yay! Yippee skippy! Commercial armor is da bomb!\", be aware that commercial armor grants any attack of 5 points or more a critical hit roll. So if you build a 100-ton biped IndustrialMech with 300 points of commercial armor (for only 12.5 tons!) with 32 and 45 points on its torso locations, then, no, it will not laugh off a burst from a RAC/5. Each shot that hits has a critical hit opportunity. An Ontos's horde-o-medium lasers is also a critical hit chance.\n\n(Also, this isn't a construction rule, but IndustrialMechs are more prone to critical hits than BattleMechs. Each successful critical hit roll gets a +1 or +2 bonus [I ferget], meaning it's a lot easier to get \"limb amputated\" or triple crits than a BattleMech.)\n\nAdd Equipment: this is pretty much like BattleMechs. Sorry, I ain't going to repeat all the spiffy IndustrialMech chainsaw and drill and kitchensink attachments. Note ICE and fuel cell engines require power amplifiers like vehicles: 10% of the weight of energy weapons, rounded up to the nearest half-ton. If you put a PPC on an ICE-powered IndustrialMech, it'll need a 1-ton power amplifier.\n\nIf you have any questions, feel free to let me know.\n\n-------------------- Mike Miller, Materials Engineer\n\nDisclaimer: Anything stated in this post is unofficial and non-canon unless directly quoted from a published book.

Been curious about the IM's ever since they started appearing in MWDA, want to see what variants one can cook up with them.\n\nCommercialHmm... A TargetMech, used to provide missile boats with moving target practice?\n\nQuote: CommercialQuote: What are the rules around having tracks mounted in the legs of a 'Mech? Just spotted the option in SSW, but have no idea what it translates to in game terms (apart from using crits and tonnage).\n\nThe foot tracks are useless in combat except when you have severe gyro or leg actuator damage. They're more suited for tight quarters maneuvering (e.g., mines) where the 'Mech doesn't want to swing its legs to avoid kicking something.\n\nTechManual pg249:\n\nIntroduced: 2440 (Draconis Combine) Tracks are an oddball piece of equipment only found on specialized IndustrialMechs such as MiningMechs and TunnelMechs. Essentially a set of powered, foot-mounted tread-skates, this equipment was developed to enable such units to move better in the tight confi nes of narrow tunnels, where a typical IndustrialMech's legs often cannot manage the full range of motion necessary for safe walking. Though their utility is limited, in some select instances\u2014such as extreme actuator or gyro damage\u2014tracks can get an otherwise crippled 'Mech back to safety in good time. Still, these systems are maintenance-intensive, and limited in speed by their small size. Too fragile for combat, they are almost never seen on BattleMechs. Even among their intended users, tracks are often shunned, with owners often stripping them (or their mechanisms) out in favor of other equipment.\n\nTech Base: Inner Sphere and Clan Unit Restrictions: Only BattleMechs and IndustrialMechs may mount tracks. Construction Rules: 'Mech-based tracks weigh 10 percent as much as the unit on which they are mounted (rounded up to the nearest half-ton). Tracks take up 1 critical slot in each of the 'Mech's legs, so a humanoid 'Mech equipped with tracks requires 2 slots in total, while a quadruped requires 4.\n\npg143 Total Warfare\n\nTRACKS During the Movement Phase, the controlling player of a 'Mech equipped with tracks must declare what movement mode the \u00b4Mech will use throughout the turn\u2014foot or tracked. These modes cannot be combined. Tracks provide Track MP equal to the 'Mech's Walking MP, but do not provide a corresponding Running MP. Actuator critical hits do not reduce tracked movement, but a critical hit on a track\u2014or the loss of a leg containing a track\u2014reduces the Track MP by half for a humanoid chassis (or by a quarter for quad chassis designs). While moving in tracked mode, leg actuator and gyro critical hits do not require a Piloting Skill Roll, though Piloting Skill Rolls for suff ering 20 points of damage or sustaining kick, charge or push attacks are still required and should be modifi ed appropriately for component damage.\n\nWhile using tracked movement, 'Mechs receive all the MP bonuses (including the +1 MP for paved surface movement) and terrain restrictions (including those for heavy woods and Depth 1+ water, not changing more than one level in a hex and so on) that apply to tracked vehicles. Tracked movement generates heat as normal for a walking 'Mech (as with walking, ICE-equipped 'Mechs generate no heat), but TSM movement modifi ers do not apply for a 'Mech using tracked movement. If a 'Mech is using tracked movement in the turn when its gyro is destroyed, it does not automatically fall. In addition, it can continue to use tracked movement provided it starts a Movement Phase on its feet. 'Mechs mounting tracks are more vulnerable to anti-'Mech infantry. Any leg attacks receive a \u20132 to-hit modifi er"}

As such, they generally wouldn't be going into combat situations on a regular basis. They're not intended for battle - at least, not outside of STO anyway.\n\nThis would be why the Grissom was so easily dispatched by a single torpedo from a scout-class Bird of Prey (B'rel).\n\nAnd before anyone says it, I've already thought of it.

Or design something from your own imagination, connecting modules of ships together and challenging your efficiency and design skills. Do you create a ship that kills and destroys everything or a peaceful trading ship that is really just a smugglers ship in disguise?!\n\nCustomize: Create customized weapons, harvesting, repair, shield and other modules by grouping them into geometrical patterns to increase their abilities! With more modules being dreamed up by the StarMade team EVERY DAY, the possibilities are endless!\n\nMultiplayer: StarMade was designed around multiplayer to begin with. Share control of your super massive ship, design a station with friends or conqueor the universe INCLUDING your pals, one sector at a time!!\n\nMultiplatform: This game runs with Java and is OPTIMIZED to run as efficiently as possible, while we may experience some bugs and bumps in alpha and beta, we are more focused on gameplay and engine optimization.\n\nThere are many more features and we will do our best to create a better website, with fully imaged tutorials, videos and other goodies ( including contests and giveaways! ).\n\nThe best support we can get at this time is the word of mouth, get more people to not only play StarMade but follow us on twitter, indieDB and become involved with our community. Remember, you guys will be the core players that helped us launch this awesome game, and we will remember you.\n\nSoft Borders\n\nThis basically means, that sectors won't load in right when you change it, but you will be always surrounded by preloading sectors. You will be able to see the objects (even moving ones) of adjacent sectors from your position. This feature will mark a milestone for the engine's core.\n\nAfter lots of hours of work, the new version is finally in a releasable state. There might still be some bugs from the countless performance improvements and optimizations, which I might not have accounted for, so please send in reports whenever your game crashes, or you see something odd.\n\nHowever, it's very complex and complicated to implement. Here are some of the problems I had to solve:\n\nEvery player effectively now loads 27 (3x3x3) sectors.\n\nThis means a lot more memory used per player on the server (not a client problem).\n\na lot more sectors and objects have to be able to load in at the same time.\n\na lot more data has to be transferred to clients, since the simultaneous \"available\" objects by player is much bigger. Most of the data is only one time data (e.g. not moving objects don't need updates, and the number of moving objects won't increase from this).\n\nevery object loaded has be updated, which will beat on the performance.\n\nClean up functions: the clean up has to be done a lot more often since more sectors get inactive at once.\n\nObject positions have to be calculated relatively\n\nAs floating point (even double precision ) values are by far not big enough for the StarMade Universe, the sectors are used to represent a relative system. This means every sector is handled around the absolute zero, which allows for the virtual infinity of the universe. The function that has to be the most robust for the new system is to calculate the positions of objects in the surrounding sectors on the clients. For the server the relative positions don't play any role, since each sector has their own context.\n\nrelative positions also influence sector requests by the client.\n\nPhysics dilemma: To keep StarMade as modular and extensible, the sector system described above is used. Every sector is using it's own physics context to handle scalability and number limits (float/double problem).\n\nThere has to be a function for secure transitions of objects from one in the next physics context. This is one of the most complex procedures (although it sounds easy at first): Bigger Objects can intersect the sector border: what sector does it belong to? The sector that has the bigger part of it of course. But now what happens if another object in the sector which the big object doesn't belong to collides with it? ... I basically have implement some kind of \"bubble\" which is formed around near objects to make sure they are in the same physics context.\n\nWe've been tirelessly testing and the newer versions of 0.080 that are out right now make multiplayer planet building possible! We've almost eliminated all the lag in multiplayer as well. Come join our US test server and check it out.\n\nWell if I can make an inference from the error, it's something to do with the vertex shaders, so it is obviously something with my graphics card because on Minecraft I can't use shader mods or anything or the game won't work.\n\nMy graphics card doesn't so GLSL shaders even knowing it's suppose to. I've been doing my research and found out why that might be though, I need to look at my multitexturing settings on OpenGL, problem is I'm retarded and don't know how to find the OpenGL settings on my computer. I'm quite new to fussing with graphics card settings and what not."}

Several months ago this was true but for the wrong reason: the opening double-wave required extreme effort (and generally cheese) to survive, but things were quite a bit easier after that. Now the early waves are way easier, and the challenge goes up from there. So it's possible to get into the game and discover later (but hopefully not too much later) that you're simply out of your league.

Go check them out... after you're done with MW, of course.\n\nThat's weird... it seems like the Filefront upload somehow damaged the download. I've replaced it with a new file and it seems to be working fine- the main link at the top has been repaired, but just in case here it is again:\n\nFurther thoughts: Interesting so far, though I've only played a little of it. AIn particular, I'd recommend trying to come up with new names instead of recycling the old Somtaaw ship names. The HW@ Valiants and HWC Acolytes are both fighters, but that's about where the similarity ends. Certainly its believable that over 100 years that sort of design evolution could have happened, but keeping the same name seems odd. On the other hand it is true that names get reused by militaries over time, but with it happening on both the Dervish and Acolyte, it seems somewhat strained. I'd suggest rifling through some religious terms and picking out some new ones.\n\nOther side note... I was quite surprised at the use of the Recon model, considering its not even textured. Is it even in the build menu in 0.0.4.0?\n\nAnyway, some pretty good stuff. I hope to have more feedback for you later after I play some more.\n\nAWill have to try that. Yes, some maps do screw you over a little bit... there's always the 'random start' button. Mainly it's because editing maps with notepad is surprisingly difficult when you're rubbish with co-ordinates. In a few cases it's intentional, though, to give any CPU players the chance to not behave stupidly.\n\nFeel free to take what you need; anything I've made for this Mod is public domain.\n\nOther side note... I was quite surprised at the use of the Recon model, considering its not even textured. Is it even in the build menu in 0.0.4.0?The second point I thought I fixed... none of the ships originally had gunfire sounds, but I added quite a few. Dervish must've slipped through.\n\nI actually like the MW Somtaaw... their fleet is supposed to look like it's been mashed together from all sorts of different designs. I think this is mentioned (though not dwelt upon) in some of the background material, or else on the website. The new Acolyte isn't even remotely the same ship as the old one. My thoughts were that since the economic collapse of around 59AHL (explained in the backstory), the Somtaaw haven't really had access to the same tech-levels as they used to. Most of their ships nowadays are plugged together from old or obsolete technology. The reason I chose the HW@ designs for them was because of the visible elements of HW1 Kushan and Taiidan- especially in the Interceptor model. The MW Acolyte is a kitbash of leftover parts from this era, so its not so much a design evolution as a throwback. It's actually a cross between Republican Taiidan stock leftover from the first war and second-generation Hiigaran Interceptors. They share the same name, because the Somtaaw are said in... I think it's the HW1 manual... to be traditionalists. They enjoy the link to their past, especially since they don't have the old Acolytes anymore (expensive to produce). Also, I wanted to keep it as a nod.\n\nYou may have a point as to the 'Dervish's' name. I wasn't going to call it that, until I saw it spinning around on the battlefield firing pulsar blasts. It struck me as looking quite similar to the old Multibeam frigates. I figure, if I noticed the similarities, so would Somtaaw engineers.\n\nPreliminary bug report: Unplayable with NLIPS activated, some ships are scaled up enough at range to fill the whole map.\n\nDo you know, I forgot you could even play the game with NLIPS on anymore.\n\nFurther: Chimera Station seems to be mostly lacking a death event\n\nDamn it. I just realised that I accidentally copied over the Chimera Death .Events from Complex- which doesn't, for some reason, blow up. I had a perfectly good death event of my own scripted, too.\n\nThanks, Siber! Look forward to hearing more. Clearly, no matter how many bugs you get, there are always extra.Nah, its still using the original scout texture, and doesn't really even have a finished mesh. It needs review, refinement, unwrapping, and ultimately textured, which is one reason why it wasn't in the build list. Still, I suppose you needn't let that stop you from using it as is if you like it that way.\n\nI'm totally playing this when I get to college and have fast enough internet to download it!Moleman2009 made all of his Beast Evolution mod public awhile back. If you have a .Big decompiler, you can get at the ships and extract their Beastly textures. Although I think I used the carrier wholesale.\n\nAiet, gave it another run... music looping is slightly broken, often times it loops in the middle of building up, which is pretty jarring. Something A third sound related point, did you change the fire sound on the Vaygr BC main gun? I don't remember it sounding like that, but it has been a while.\n\nThe Trader units seem to be lacking interface icons, which is bothersome\n\nA couple design/balance points: The Striker seems to have entirely fixed weapons, which is odd with quite visible turrets. If this is intentional I'd recomend stripping off the turret meshes and just using the fixed forward gun barrels, though the empty pads might look a bid odd. Still, I'd find it preferable to having the completely inoperative rear turret hanging there It'd be nice if battlecruisers weren't an absolute must to end every game. Still, I've only played a handful of games, so maybe there are more tactics to be discovered.\n\nOn the plus side, the new maps are quite refreshing, those I've played encourage a verticality and spreading of forces that HW2 generally doesn't, and your musical taste is admirable.\n\nAiet, gave it another run... music looping is slightly broken, often times it loops in the middle of building up, which is pretty jarring.\n\nAh, so this is universal? Unfortunately I can't fix this, because my HW2 Music.big, or something involved there anyhow, is corrupted... so even normal HW2 music plays in a strange way, often devolving into static during a match. I had noticed a looping problem, but I'd attributed it to this. Is there any way to control looping lengths? There's no command for it in the individual sound .luas.\n\nA third sound related point, did you change the fire sound on the Vaygr BC main gun?\n\nNope.I have no idea why this would be. None of these craft are classified as utility. I haven't reclassified anything as a resource collector.\n\nThe Trader units seem to be lacking interface icons, which is bothersome\n\nOn purpose-through pragmatism. There's no reason they'd share any of the other two fleet's ship chevrons, and I didn't have any replacements handy.\n\nA couple design/balance points: The Striker seems to have entirely fixed weapons, which is odd with quite visible turrets.\n\nThat's odd... I'm sure I've seen those turrets move in combat. I changed the weapon effect, but not the weaponfire itself\n\nThe idea is that Cradles are your AA guns... I figure that given all the extra hit-points, Cradles aren't going to be practically killable by strike-craft anyway. But strike-craft can still kill frigates and gut battlecruisers, destroy resourcing operations and cripple carriers (although the Hiigs have an advantage there). So they're still important, but it's just if you want to fight with a Mothership, you need something of comparable class. By the way, Hiigaran Motherships are still quite vulnerable to Corvette swarms, especially reinforced bio-corvettes. And Elite Bombers are okay against Vaygr missile barrages, because their hulls regenerate. Though don't get me wrong, you're right about Cradles stomping on strike craft. That's their thing now. They're like the queen in chess.\n\nIon and Heavy Missile Frigates can cause headaches for Motherships, if there are a lot of them- MS fire can only deal with one or two frigate class ships at a time, and to do that thet have to focus fire, which diverts the AA guns and exposes subsystems to bomber attacks.\n\nThis is a bit different for the Vaygr. Heavy Shrikes will die straight away when fighting a Cradle, but they can do a fair bit of damage first. And three squads of them will kill a carrier in one. And God Shrikes can kill everything.\n\nStill, I've only played a handful of games, so maybe there are more tactics to be discovered.\n\nI hope so... one thing about the MW mod, I've tried to dial down the strict Rock-Paper-Scissors dynamic. Hopefully, this'll make thing a bit more reliant on imaginative tactics.\n\nHum, There is only one start location in (6p) 2a) The New Frontier. All six players start at the same place and I've always one or two MS colliding each other at the beginning of the game.\n\nThat's completely intentional. See 'Unfair starts' in the Gameplay guide. There are only two maps like this in the whole mod, but the idea is to completely screw the player over from the get go, force them to think on their feet. Unpleasant surprises. The level's not called Welcome to the New Frontier for nothin'...\n\nIf that's not to your taste, you can always enable 'random start points.' Of course, then you risk jumping into the middle of a derelict...\n\nEdit : is the lone gunship in 2c) Gateway an easter egg or anything else ?\n\nYep, Easter Egg. Also, try playing Cathedral of the Dead. The best easter egg is there. Well, there also might be a literal egg amongst the salvage on the Welcome to the New Frontier mission, but I was never able to find it to confirm. If anyone sees it, please post a screenshot.\n\n4a) Stonefalls, isn't there a little too much asteroids ? I've 4Go RAM and I can't possibly run it smoothly.\n\nWow. I knew there were a lot of asteroids (there's a warning on the level-start), but I didn't think it'd slow down a 4Gig computer.\n\nIf that's not to your taste, you can always enable 'random start points.' Of course, then you risk jumping into the middle of a derelict...\n\nAre you sure this option works ? It seems to only circle through existing starting points, so all players still jump at the same place... Should try again though.\n\nAlso, try playing Cathedral of the Dead. The best easter egg is there.\n\nI think I saw it too. I've seen it's salvageable like in the HW2 campaign, does it do anything if you salvage it ?\n\nWow. I knew there were a lot of asteroids (there's a warning on the level-start), but I didn't think it'd slow down a 4Gig computer.\n\nIt may come from my crappy graphic card too. This is the only level that caused me problem though.\n\nOh, anybody fought the Dead yet?I think I saw it too. I've seen it's salvageable like in the HW2 campaign, does it do anything if you salvage it ?\n\n'Fraid not. Wanted to make it usable, but Megaliths can't be given the ability to move. Otherwise they automatically gravitate toward a certain orientation, so you can't have them drifting at unusual angles. You can salvage it, but it just sits there.\n\nWait, hold on. HW2 campaign? Are we talking about the same thing? This easter egg was in a couple of campaigns, but not that one...Sort of. The Dead have a very specific, quite tricky series of tactics that they rely on. It requires a lot of money, but if it works it's basically unstoppable. It won't so much kill you as make it very, very hard for your fleet to win. You'll see if you play against them with lots of resources.\n\nIt's a good idea to kill them as soon as you see them, which is obviously what the other AI did. If you leave them for long enough to build up... well, you'll probably see eventually.\n\n(You can play as the Dead, too, but you won't know how to use them until you've fought them properly).\n\n- Microships are unable to jump using hyperspace gate platforms. Is this intentional?\n\nRegarding The Dead (put in spoiler tags because I don't know how much you want to keep a secret):\n\nTheAlso, in the player info, I can clearly see the unit caps for them, but you apparently want them invisible? And what's with the bottom cap of 2? I haven't found anything that makes it go up.\n\nPlease don't hurt me for saying all of that...\n\nBy the way, the music during the ice level is absolutely beautiful. Could you please tell me who made it and what it's called?\n\n- Microships are unable to jump using hyperspace gate platforms. Is this intentional?\n\nYes, unfortunately. When I tried to give probes hyperjuming capability, the game would crash whenever they jumped. I have no idea why, though, and I'm looking into the problem. Meantime, I took out that ability to stop problems.\n\nNow, as for the Dead... the thing about them is, I wanted them to be a little bit of a puzzle. To use them right, you've got to watch the CPU and build them for yourselves, and then do a decent amount of guessing. But, just so that I can answer a few of Lovecrafter's points, here are some spoilers. Don't press if you think you can work out the puzzle for yourselves...\n\nSecrets of the\nThe CPU can build Slabs, but apparently never wants to. I think this is because all a Slab does is sit there and wait for things to collide with it, so the CPU is understandably confused at the concept. It will build Corpses, trust me. It generally only does it when the Corpse Bay is under direct attack, or else as support units- it doesn't always bother. This is the way it's supposed to be. If you've tried using a Corpse, you'll note that their weapons make them great for disruption and pretty rubbish at targeting anything specific. If the computer builds Corpses, they'll mostly hang around in the wake of the Corpse Bay, in it's tentacle-like tails of debris. They don't have any engine trails, so you won't be able to see them until they attack you. Mostly, the CPU only builds about six of them. They're not that useful other than as a desperate defence.\n\nBut they are funny.\n\nThe computer is using Big Misses perfectly, however. You see...\n\nI assume if you fought an expert CPU with a decent amount of money (the Dead are expensive, you need to be rich), you would've seen more and more Big Misses jumping onto the field. The longer the game goes on, the more show up... sometimes they cluster for a bit, but they'll always eventually spread out until they fill the map. They don't have any weapons, and they don't have any offensive skills. But if you build one yourself, you'll notice they have a red modifier sphere.\n\nAny enemy ship within that modifier sphere will experience a small drop in accuracy and weapon damage- barely noticeable. This is attributed to the morale drop that comes with trying to fight the Dead. But the more Big Misses there are, the more of these spheres overlap. The more they overlap, the weaker enemy ships become- eroding away at their performance. The more of the map the Misses cover, the more enemy ships are compromised. I played an expert CPU on 'uber-rich' once and left the room for twenty minutes. When I came back, the entire map was absolutely flooded with Big Misses. With that many enemy ships around, screwing up fleet performance, you have to spend valuable time trying to exterminate the Big Misses- but by the time you've killed one, another two have usually shown up. And all the time, Sally's will be doing what Sallies do. Which I'm sure you've seen.\n\nThe other thing is, collisions. Enough Big Misses can make it hard for enemy ships to maneuver without slamming into them. Strike craft can't pull up in time to avoid collisions, and if the Dead field gets dense enough, capitals will find their maneuverability compromised. That's what Slabs are good for- they're big enough to effectively 'wall-off' large areas, though they can't move.\n\nSo, that's the Dead in a nutshell. I wanted them to have a very different, very alien pattern of behavior. They just show up, act really weird and at times seem to be following an odd agenda of their own. To play well as the Dead, do what the AI does. Flood the map with Big Misses, which will impair the enemy fleet, then get moving with the Sallies. You don't really need Slabs, which are just for fun.\n\nHere's a hint at their motives; the Dead are debris. When they show up, the first thing they start doing is... building a debris field.\n\nBy the way, I've just realised how obscure this 'puzzle' is. Maybe I should have explained things a little more...\n\nAlso, in the player info, I can clearly see the unit caps for them, but you appareenty want them invisible? And what's with the bottom cap of (I believe) 2? I haven't found anything that makes it go up.\n\nPlayer Info? Where's that?\n\nOh wait. I vaguely remember there being a thing that displays... uh, is it fleet composition? Damn. I totally forgot that display would need editing. I think the '2' is probably the number of Frigate Points/Angel Barracks you can have. The Vaygr can't build them.\n\nBy the way, the music during the ice level is absolutely beautiful. Could you please tell me who made it and what it's called?\n\nIt's by Heitor Villalobos, but I'm afraid I seem to have lost the track name...\n\nWow, I never would've thought... That is impressive. If you really think you need to drop more hints, how about using the \"function\" line (or was it called \"role\"?) under the ship's name and write something obscure there. Thanks for the info!Thanks to a conversation with John Galt, I think I've worked this out. There are a couple of maps that take place inside huge dust clouds; sometimes the clouds are dense, sometimes they're virtually invisible. They will show up on the sensors manager when they ignite in the presence of energy weapons/explosions. They'll also cause minute damage to everything in the sector, much as a smaller dust cloud causes minute damage to everything in its reach.\n\nI've just checked this out and it turns out that Resource Collectors seem to be really sensative to Dust Cloud ingitions; they register it as an attack and don't shut up about it until you move them somewhere less highly charged. Lower strike-craft chatter frequency does silence them a bit, though.\n\nAnyway. Just to say, that's that mystery solved. It wasn't so much a bug as the RCs being oversensative and wimpy. Just so I can be sure, do you remember what map you were playing on?\n\nVery good mod, I like it. The mysterious setting of the dead is really interesting. The first time I read the part of the dead in the vaygr historical briefing my only thought was that I wanted to hear more about it. For that I think a single-player campaign would be really cool.\n\nBut I have a question: If I understood some of the previous posts right on some maps there spawn dead ships that attack all players for example from the dead gate?\nOr were they built by AI players?\n\nEDIT: I think I found a bug: Everytime I play a 1vs1 skirmish game against the AI (Standard Difficulty, Starting Resources: Under Funded, Race: Me and AI Vaygr) the AI is doing some crazy things. It builds maybe 10 mins normal, but then when the AI has built a Capital Ships facility it moves with it's Mothership straight to my location and attacks me with it's Mothership and some Destroyers. I have never seen the AI building a Shipyard and choosing one of the Second Tiers. I tested it several times with the same settings at different maps. Only in one 2vs2 game the AI's have build Shipyards and choosed Second. In Homeworld 2 Vanilla I've never seen the AI doing something like that (and the gameplay for the AI is exactly the same as in Vanilla Homeworld 2).\n\nThat's troubling, but I think it might have something to do with the AI and the money. I've only ever playtested against AIs set to 'HARD' and 'EXPERT' -they always build from the second tier, generally quite quickly. However, the second tier only kicks in once shipyards are available. If the AI doesn't have much money and is only set to standard, then it won't bother trying to build all the way up to shipyards- it'll just rush your Mothership with its own.\n\nI think this is a variant of the fact that in Vanilla HW2, the AI on lower difficulties takes longer to build shipyards. Here, for some inexplicable reason, it gets to a certain point and thinks: 'Hey, why should I bother building a shipyard when I don't have very much money but I do have this great big Mothership?'\n\nI'm not certain, though. Changing the HW2 AI can have very unpredictable effects. It took days to get the AI to do anything at all with even the slightest code change! Of course, that might be because I'm not very good with AI... it really needs a specialist programmer, if there are any out there.\n\nI've definitely seen the AI build from the second tier, though- but not in a 1 vs 1 game. Hmm. Let me know if other settings have similar problems.\n\nBut I have a question: If I understood some of the previous posts right on some maps there spawn dead ships that attack all players for example from the dead gate?\nOr were they built by AI players?\n\nThe Dead are built by AI players. They're a second tier option.\n\nAnd as for a campaign... well, I have some idle thoughts in that area.\n\nOk I will play from now on at hard difficulty. The complex mod has the same problem that an AI on difficulty standard is doing nothing or crazy things. Maybe it's a generally problem with Homeworld 2 modding. But if it works proper on hard or expert it is no serious one.\n\nI will do some more testgames. Maybe you can do some testgames in 1vs1 games, too.\n\nI played two 1vs1 games against a hard AI at the map Jadeth with starting resources set to Wealthy. In the first match the AI was Vaygr and in the second match the AI was Hiigarian. In both the AI built lots of frigates and destroyers and attacked me. But everytime the AI attacked with it's Mothership, but it hasn't built a shipyard.\nBut if I play a match on 2vs2 the AI really works perfectly.\n\nMaybe you can ask Beghins from the complex mod what coding at the AI to do for fixing this bug.\n\nMaybe you can ask Beghins from the complex mod what coding at the AI to do for fixing this bug.\n\nI appreciate the suggestion, but something tells me the Complex team are rather busy with, well, Complex. AI coding for Homeworld 2 is pretty tetchy- I don't like poking it with a stick unless I have to.\n\nI've been playing some matches of various combination- sometimes the results are as you describe, sometimes not. If the money level is above 'rich,' then you WILL get AI shipyards, though. Otherwise, just have a spare AI player set to 'easy.' 2 vs 1 also seems to work out fine.\n\nI do tend to play on Expert all the time myself. I just wasn't such a damn cheat.\n\nPurple\n\nWhere do I find this patch? I have tried but the game can't find the update server and all the downloads I got from googling it are pay to download sites...\n\nLuprica, a forge world on the oposite side of the eye of terror. Contemplating treason and revenge.\n\nI am having problems with installing this.\nI fallowed the instructions to the letter, copied the file \"MothershipWarfare.big\" into my HW2 folder (D:\\Program Files\\Sierra\\Homeworld2) and I patched the game beforehand.\nBut when I make a shortcut by your instructions all I keep getting is this:"}
{"text": "There's an element to the whole Medieval veneer that does seem a bit silly to me. However, I do find this premise as stated in The Inner Sphere at a Glance to be very intruiging\n\nIn original Battletech (I started playing in the late '80's when I found some of the students I was student teacher for - playing this game at lunch), none of the inner sphere factions really had the capability to make Battkemechs. They were handed down from father to son over generations and were very scarce. Very few new ones were made and they were often put into circulation when a cache of Lostech was discovered someplace.\n\nIf you were lucky enough to be the offspring of someone who had a Wasp, you got the wasp and unless you captured another in battle (very rare) or were granted one by a benefactor state (very, very, very rare) you would never have any other Mech.\n\nThis is where the whole fuedal aspect came into play. A lance of Wasps was a HUGE power on a planet, it was a big deal when a lance fought another lance. Fiefdoms were associated with the individual Battelmech. So you got Dad's Wasp and became Barron of Munchkin IV.\n\nMechwarriors payed fealty up the chain to one of the four factions. It was a Feudal society. Mechwarriors are the knights of that society.\n\nDarq I hear what you're saying. At first that aspect of the Medieval flavoring was missed by me, but the family heritage part of it became a bit more apparent as I read some of the sourcebooks. I'm much more comfortable with the Medieval elemant of the setting now and have in fact grown to really enjoy it.\n\nFor the setting, the ComStar sourcebook was what sealed the deal for me. There's so many elements of SciFi noir intertwined with that organization that I doubt I could ever put together enough adventures/mission to even get close to the bottom of it.\n\nSo Peregry - really likin what I see so far, but have you considered making 'Mechs just big people and going all in with SW rules set? One of the things mechs share in common with people is they are very complicated systems.\n\nUse the same rules for combat. They have armor, by location (covered in the rules), you have weapons stats you can extrapalate from with regards to figuring out armor and weapons - Cannons can be used to extrapalate auto cannons, as your base damage the M2HB is in the main rules.\n\nThe main rules cover the effects of damage to the overall system, targetting individual locations, etc. Take the healing rules, use Tech skills and make them repair rules.\n\nThe first is we like the way BattleTech handles damage and such, and much of the tough, walking tank feel of Mechs come from that damage system. We love Savage Worlds, but its damage system leads to more fragile, characters and very swingy, rather than steady, damage that often results in sudden dramatic kills rather than a grind down that often occurs with BattleTech.\n\nThe second is the amount of balance work that goes into all the various weapon systems. As it stands, BattleTech is pretty balanced, not perfectly mind you, but enough so that we would not be able to convert all the weapons in a balanced manner, especially when you consider figuring armor into it. Using the SW weapons as a base also leads to some ridiculous numbers. Modern tank guns in BattleTech are statted as being Light or Medium Rifles. Being generous we'll say a 120mm Cannon (5d10 damage, AP 68) is a medium rifles, which does 6 damage in BattleTech. This gives 1 BattleTech scale damage coming out to about 1d8 damage per point. So this means an AC20 has to roll 20d8. This means that resolving damage using a SW style system actually ends up taking longer due to the amount of dice being rolled. Its obviously impractical, and so we couldn't use SW numbers as a baseline, and instead we'd have to come up with our own damage scale. Where we then face even more complex balancing issues. _________________ - Peregry\nIt is always giant stompy robot time!\n\nI guess the question is did you want to do an RPG universe for Battletech or a combined RPG / Miniature game. If its the former, balance doesn't matter and combat can remain nebulous. If the latter then yes I see where you are goingGlad you're liking what you see, and feel free to ask design questions or give feedback.\n\nIf you mean a pure SW conversion, I don't mind. If you want it included in the SBT documents in the optional rules section, I'll even integrate it, with you credited of course.\n\nI think there may already exist SW mecha rules in one of the supplements, so I would suggest finding out and if they do use them as a starting point. No need to recreate the wheel, after all. _________________ - Peregry\nIt is always giant stompy robot time!\n\nDarq - I briefly attempted Mecha as characters in my Inteface Zero setting, but reverted back to the SW vehicles style mechs in the setting rules' due to my players not caring for the character approach. I think vehicles as characters works well for spaceships (I've experimented using Chaosmeister's Savage Space rules), but not that well for Mechs. If you want to create Mecha that use the Savage World rules for vehicles, I'd recommend using the examples in Clint Blacks Basic SW Mecha Rules doc at savageheroes.com or the technique in the Sci Fi Gear Toolkit.\n\nAs to not using some BattleTech rules in a SW conversion; I'm not sure there's that big of an audience for it. Since getting into the BT tabletop and exploring SBT, I've participated in a number of threads with fans discussing the different MechWarrior RPGs. Those threads were on the official BT forums as well as on RPG.NET site, so not just current fans. A recurring theme in all of those threads was that fans liked 2 different scales and they all liked some BT crunch. At the same time, there were a lot of comments that using standard BT rules (and the adapted rules in most of the MW RPGs) for mech combat scale bogged things down. It was almost a unanimous consensus that pure BT (or something very close) rules within a RPG was far too slow and crunchy to support the fluidity of an RPG adventure. I think you have to take an approach like peregry and his team have, where you balance some of the crunch of BT with the better elements of Savage Worlds like movement and the combat to-hit game mechanics.\n\nAs to having PCs and mechs on the same scale (not sure if you're inteding that) its far trickier than it at 1st seems. Even in Interface Zero where mechs are much smaller and far, far less powerful than BT 'Mechs, they seem truly omnipotent when placed amongst PC's. As a GM you either have to put every PC in a mech (very tricky in that setting due to costs, backgrounds and potential NPC retaliation) or be very careful how you structure the action sequences in adventures. From what little exploration I've done in putting together some SBT adventures, I can say its far easier to handle the transition to a different scale for adventures in which MechWarrior PCs mount up.\n\nAnyhow, just my own 2 cents.\n\n[Edit] BTW, I'm with you on the earlier periods in the BT canon - or at least the earlier part of the 31st century. My campaign is going to begin in the late 3rd Succession War (starting 3020) and run to the War of 3039. I'm still not sure what house PC's will be in, but Im leaning towards Davion or Kurita - favoving Kurita so I can involve the Ronin War and the Free Rasalhague Republic. In particular within that timeframe, I find the years around Tiepolo's reign as ComStar Primus to be very dark and interesting. I'm defnititely going to have some ComStar draconinan antics figure into some of my adventures.\n\nCan you ellucidate on why it didn't work well? I would be interested in what pain points you ran into.\n\nWith regards to the setting, I think one of the big roleplaying factors missing from \"Neo-Battletech\" is the irreplaceability of mechs, ammunition and components. I don't see anyone these days ceding the battlefield to avoid trashing their irreplacable mech or scavanging battlefields for ammo. Those were the good old days!\n\nHate to break it to you, but the days of BattleMechs being completely irreplaceable was gone back when the game first became known as BattleTech, rather than BattleDroids. Canon wise, the Great Houses could build repair parts and ammo with impunity (I'd never heard of ammo being in short supply before, merely Mechs) throughout the entire history.\n\nAnything else that you've heard was, quite simply, wrong.* ;p\n\nFrom a design standing point, we've been trying to ensure that everything within the system we can convert, is converted. To our playing, we're actually playing through the game's history, though our campaign started in the mid-3040s and we're in the original Clan Invasion right now. The Clans are a great antagonist from a GMing perspective, so long as they perceive the PCs as honorable opponents they will only attack with a force just good enough to threaten, but not enough to overwhelm the PCs. This is the opposite of the Great Houses, who once a group becomes a sufficient threat will simply unload overkill and be done with it.\n\n---------------------------\n* In regards to BattleTech canon, newer ALWAYS trumps older unless you're dealing with a 3rd person omniscient viewpoint (ie novels). Most source books, especially those with a lot of setting fluff, are actually considered to be written \"in universe\" and subject to the in universe publisher's limited knowledge, or just flat out misinformation. In fact, one of the reason the earlier source books paint the Inner Sphere as worse off than it actually was was because ComStar wanted it to look like that in an effort to undermine the Great Houses. _________________ - Peregry\nIt is always giant stompy robot time!\n\nOnly the most technologically advanced planets can manufacture them, and few planets have any major technological base left. The Succession Wars have devestated the industry of the Inner Sphere, and 'Mech fatalities have almost exceeded the total output of new 'Mechs and spare parts. Battlefield salvage and Star League supply depots have become major objectives in the Succession Wars.\n\nNow granted I may have run with this a bit, but I seem to remember the early novels: pre-Clans agreeing with this interpretation. I seem to remember some Comstar shanannigans where they were hiding the tech and controlling the political clime with judicious release of parts.\n\nThat was definitely the status quo in 3025, but things had picked baxk up in time for the 4th War.\n\nBasically the 1st and 2nd Succession Wars were total war with Star League era weapons (and WMDs in the 1st War). The 3rd, which lasted the longest, was at the lower level intensity, and by the end of it Mechs had been teched down and were becoming more rare. The Helm Memory Core and NAIS began reversing the, seeing the return of full scale troop movement in the 4th War and then the reemergence of some tech in the War of 3039. It was not until after the Clan Invasion the Inner Sphere had gotten, militarily tech wise, to the same level as the Star League.\n\nComStar never sold tech, as far as I remember, except when they sold the Dracs Star League era mechs in the lead up to the War of 3039, and that was purely a move to spite Hanse Davion and the fledgling Federated Commonwealth. Other than that, if they had it, they kept it. Of course, perhaps they did sell things occasionally and we never heard about it, they kept the records after all... _________________ - Peregry\nIt is always giant stompy robot time!\n\nCan you ellucidate on why it didn't work well? I would be interested in what pain points you ran into.\n\nSure... its a fairly complex discussion so I'll try to keep it simple, but I'll probably fail. Bottom line, with mecha (Golemmechs in Interface Zero) as chacacters we found it sucked the mecha out of the setting. With the mecha having their own traits, playing them became more akin to a super powers or Fantasy setting where you're battling with your omnipotent summoned companion.\n\nI used 2 differents systems. Initially I just treated them as WC's and used the construct rules as per SWD. I handled everything as per standard characters but kept vehicular ACC/TS, gave them d12+1 base strength and of course they had Heavy Armor that began at a base of 20(5) and upgradable. I tried using character pace briefly, but it really didn't fit the IZ setting at all. The result was truly a powerful entitiy, but playing them was more like playing Mechaton; your summoned, bad-ass construct.\n\nthe 2nd was a mecha variation of Chaosmeisters' Spaceships as Characters (Savage Space) system. In that system the 5 base attributes define much of a spaceship, so I adapted it to mecha. In IZ there's a matrix of 11 different variable systems that define a mech, with most of those conferring a bonus to a piloting PC's skill and some a penalty to a NPC's skill. So using the Savage Space model I linked those systems to a base attribute and made them upgradable by increasing the attribute type. While others -still linked to an attribute- could only be enhanced through parts upgrades. All attributes start at a die level of d4 just as in standard SWD character creation. Something to note about IZ golemmechs, is that they would sit somewhere between BattleTech Body Armor and Light 'Mechs.\nSo...basically what it broke down to was:\n\nThe ACC/TS (engine), VCI-Ring, GPS, Commlink, Life Support, Structural toughness and number of wounds were all treated as integral parts of the mech and consequently they could be improved with an attribute increase. All the others could only be enhanced via parts upgrades, with the linked attribute providing a bonus via a lower cost (the higher the cheaper.) A good thing because stuff is damn expensive in IZ. Strength was critical as it not only increased hand/melee damage but also the number of slots that allowed other parts to be upgraded or added - all weapons take up 1 slot. I was told by the setting creators that the golemmech's wouldn't be capable of kicking motions, so that why its not factored in. The Heavy Amor penetration prevention could also only be increased via armor upgrades.\n\nMeanwhile the mech's/golemmech's Shooting, Piloting, Fighting, Notice, Stealth and Climbing skills were all standard character skills, with the exception that stealth required a stealth unit installation to be available and climbing was linked to Strength. Golemmechs can't jump in IZ so that wasn't a worry. I didn't go as far as mecha/golemmech hindrances and edges, but it would have been very easy to add them. There's quite a bit more to it than that (such as intial build points) but hey I can't type forever.\n\nThe result of the 2nd approach were mecha that still seemed like a sophisticated combat mech, but the flavor of them made them feel a bit too advanced for the setting; IZ is Earth 2087. The plus of this was it did allow some fun fighting in golemmech Vs golemmech situations, but its hard to provide that often in IZ scenarios. And you can't easily shift scale in IZ like in SBT. The 2nd technique did help a bit with preventing the mecha from feeling like they'd been completely sucked out of the setting, but ultimately players wanted their PC's skills to drive the actions of a mecha and this still didn't provide that. In the end I just tweaked the base IZ golemmech system (which does have quite a few holes) and my players were much happier with that.\n\nSomething I don't think I explained too well in my last post, is exactly how I felt mehca as characters sucked the mecha out of the setting. There's actually 3 points; 1) as already mentioned, it makes mecha feel too much like you're battling with a 20 ton, summoned behemoth; 2) For a Hard SciFi setting (which I consider both BT and IZ to be) it diminishses a lot of that cool flavoring and interesting tech; 3) It detracts to some extent from roleplaying, as the consequences/challenges of being in mech battles gets relegated to the design and skill of the mechs as opposed to the PC's strengths and weaknesses.\n\nIt was the 3rd point that was the biggest complaint amongst my players, hence their desire to really have their PCs driving golemmechs. In terms of the impact on hard-sci tech; despite best intentions and attention to detail, you lose some of it when you have mecha as characters. Trying to maintain it all results in mecha characters being too complex. Contrast that to SBT where you keep all the grind, crunch, nuts & bolts and myomer bundles of BT's 'Mech construction technology. IZ is less hard-sci than BT, but even with it there were detractions; i.e. the VCI-Ring really became a purposeless piece of equipment with golemmechs as characters, whereas it's a major boon for PC pilots.\n\nWhere I think mecha as characters can fly well is in Pulp SciFi or Weird Science settings. So for those cool, wheeled Hailfire Droids in Star Wars II or those retro, radio controlled mecha in Sky Captain the World of Tomorrow, the rules I adapted from Savage Space could work nicely.\n\nLast edited by kronovan on Wed Jun 27, 2012 11:10 am; edited 1 time in total\n\nI don't think I explained correctly where I want to go with this (of course I'm not sure exactly where that is so...). I don't want to treat the mecha as characters, per se. I want to handle combat and movement like character combat and movement, not vehicle combat and movement.\n\nPlayer A in his Warhammer shoots a dual PPC shot at a Marauder. Player A makes a ranged attack using his Mech Shooting skill instead of his shooting skill. Everything else works as normal.\n\nThe Marauder has armor and a Toughness (though they will be much bigger than normal characters (like 50)) and the PPC does damage of 10d20 (MG does 1 point (2d10 for M2HB) and PPC does 10 points damage (Which scaled up to match the M2HB would be 20d10, which I took the liberty of changing to 10d20 - same upper limit, more damage likely). Then go on as normal.\n\nMechs can be shaken and incapacitated, managing damage without getting into all the fiddly minutia, they can recover as the Pilot overrides burnout systems etc - you can do a lot with the narrative! Injury table represents systems knocked out by location.\n\nI picture applying healing / medical rules, using Astech skill, etc. So you don't need to track the specifics, just generalizations - The left arm is out.\n\nI'm not sure how abstracting damage will enhance RP, I also think that your idea might actually be slower than what we use in SBT. The only thing that it sort of allows is a more seamless transition between normal SW and Mechs.\n\nAs to speed, let us consider the attack scenario you presented, that of a single PPC attack.\n\nStep 1 is to roll the attack roll, this is the same Gunnery vs TN. This is quick and painless, so long as everyone knows their TNs.\n\nStep 2 in SBT is to determine hit location. 2d6 and consult a table doesn't take long (moreso if you have a hit location roller app like we use). This is probably the biggest slowdown in SBT, but not where a single big hit weapon is concerned.\n\nStep 2 for you is Roll Damage. For small weapons this won't be bad, but for the PPC with 10d20 this will take quite a bit of time.\n\nStep 3 for SBT is apply Damage to location.\n\nStep 3 for you is apply Damage vs Toughness.\n\nStep 4 for both is determine results of Damage, deal with \"Wounds\" or Criticals. I have no idea how these would compare. In SBT this can be as quick as \"nothing/not happening\" to quite a while due to resolving crits, using bennies to \"Soak\" etc. I imagine this could also be as quick as the similar nothing of SBT or a long drawn out process.\n\nPlease don't think I'm trying to discourage you or criticize the idea, rather I'm just trying to point out complications and am curious your opinions of things"}

{"text": "First of all, are your Seers and Warlocks not equipped with Witchblades and close combat weapons (respectively)? They need weapons to fight with. Other than that, I'm more or less happy with the configuration.\n\nYour Dire Avenger Exarch probably shouldn't have a diresword. Stick with the power weapon; it's cheaper and only slightly less effective.\n\nThe Guardians are a little off... why are you Enhancing them when they're defenders? You're far better off with conceal. They could also use some weapons platforms, and probably smaller squads. You should put your Bright Lance with the Black Guardian defenders... not on a Vyper.\n\nThe vypers are fine, so long as you scrap the bright lance. Vypers should never have slow-firing weapons, due to their low BS. Give them Starcannons or Scatter Lasers.\n\nI've never been big on support batteries. If I were you, I'd try a Wraithlord or some Falcons, or even Dark Reapers. I'd suggest one Wraithlord, at least, armed with whatever you think is fitting (its a good mount for a bright lance though).\n\nThe army you've made up looks like it would do well in a defensive capacity, if not for the lack of bright lances. With so few Aspect Warriors, I don't suggest advancing unless you have to. There are two paths to choose, and I'd suggest defensive over offensive in your case. To bolster that, rangers and heavy weapons should do the job. Guide your most important weapon, fortune your Wraithlord, and mind war anything big.

{"text": "ship types, yes. However, the Federation has more individual ship classes, with 37 total between all ranks and 15 at tier 5. The KDF, meanwhile, has 33 between all ranks, 11 of which are T5. This, of course, excludes the Jem'Hadar attack ship, as it isn't exclusive to either faction, as well as shuttles and fighters, though the Federation still has the numbers advantage there with 7 to the KDF's 3.\n\nThe grass is still very much greener on the Federation's side.\n\nT5 ships are all that really matters the way the game is atm, each time you reach a new tier it makes the previous tier obsolete, I'd be OK with having fewer total ships but more or at least equal top tier ships.\n\n.\n\nFederation fighters are all warp-capable, long-range craft, with heads, bunks, and replicators, Carriers aren't necessary for them to operate effectively.\n\nThe Empire has an entirely different view of death than the Federation does. Klingons desire death in battle it's one of the few ways to earn an honored place in Sto'Vo'Kor. Starfleet seeks to avoid it if at all possible. And without the plot armor that was always available to the main casts of the series (last minute beam-outs, ejections, etc..), the attrition rate of Starfleet Fighter Pilots would be unacceptable.\n\nConsidering the shields and firepower of mainline vessels, Fighters are rarely the best option. Sending Fighters against a BoP is like sending speedboats with crews armed with handguns against a modern Submarine with a Titanium Hull. The Speedboats won't do any damage, the Sub can destroy them all easily, or evade them entirely, either way, the speedboats aren't going to win. There's a reason why very few KDF Carrier Jockeys use Fighters, and a great many use BoPs.\n\nShipwise, parity matters very little. What matters is how the ships are used. I, for example, use a a Science Officer in a Nebula to hunt down and destroy Carriers. In spite of their pets, in spite of their hulls and shields, the U.S.S. Eisenhower tends to wipe the floor with them, especially if I have a good wingman in an Escort.\n\nAs far as playstyles go, that's not really an argument. Carriers are freely available if you get a Klingon to the cap, or for C-Points if you're impatient. You could roll Joined Trill and pretend to be a spy for the Federation if you like, there's nothing wrong with rolling a Klingon if you want to play a Carrier, hundreds of people have done just that.\n\nThis is the most reasonable I have ever been on the subject of a Federation Carrier. I don't want to bring out the big guns, but I will if you make me.\n\nT5 ships are all that really matters the way the game is atm, all previous each time you reach a new tier it makes the previous tier obsolete, I'd be OK with having fewer total ships but more top tier ships.\n\nWell, given that the Federation currently has both more total ships and T5 ships, this isn't really an issue anyway.\n\n[list][*].[/i]Considering that sticking by their principles and maintaining a ship design philosophy around exploration and diplomacy over military might has won them every war they've been in, it's not hard to believe that the Federation would do any differently now.\n\nAlso I don't want the devs to anger Roddenberry's ghost any more than they probably already have. allowed allowedPrecisely. The Federation is slowly waking up to this fact. Assuming the game lasts long enough, it'd be kind of interesting to see future Episodes tell a story of a Federation that starts to degrade into something more strongly resembling the Terran Empire.\n\nIt is more likely that starfleet engineer corps will look at the KDF carrier and produce a ship to deal with it. This would probably be armed with heavy shielding and armour and point defence phaser banks/ turrets.\n\nI doubt starfleet would enjoy sending pilots to their deaths so easily, however, fighters do tend to carry heavy, disposable, weaponry for their size. This would be a definate candidate for Starfleet to look into dealing with."}
{"text": "that if multiple weapons fire at the same time, then you get -10 (or so) to the Weapon power setting.\n\nMy question - I am using a Nostromo N50, which has a macro capability and I can spread out firing of the weapons by some fraction of a second. The question would be does that get around the drop in weapon power setting from firing multiple weapons?\n\nI assume that if you use the Fire All, then weapons would tend to always fire at the same time getting the deduction. If a macro fires the weapons in sequence, does that get around the deduction?\n\nI did set up a loop that fires the weapons sequentially along with triggering the Cannon Rapid Fire option each time through the loop. I finally got a working DPS program by doing some modifications to the COH damage program, so I guess I could run some tests, but I thought I would ask first."}
{"text": "When i was relatively new to the project, i created this topic on terraforming. Looking back, i think the idea was too complicated.\n\nThese are the basic rules for terraforming. It has been argued that something more complex should be put in place, but you can always add complexity later.\n\nWith the terraforming tech you can terraform a planet to any EP. However you can only terraform one step at a time. Functionally terraforming is like a building project. It has a rather high PP for each step around the EP wheel. Thus planets with an EP near your desired EP will be much more desirable targets because they can be terraformed at 1/4 the time and PP that would be required for the worst EPs. This is IMHO sufficient.\n\nOnce the step is complete the terraforming \"building\" disappears and the planet's EP is changed.\n\nSome have argued that terraformed planets should be \"fragile\" and with some sort of attack could be reverted to their original form. However this only make sense with certain EPs. For instance if you terraformed an ocean planet into a barren one, it would make absolutely no sense for the barren planet to revert to it's former state for any reason. Since reversion doesn't make sense for all EPs it should not be included.\n\nTech tree:\n\nPlanetary Geology (30) + Planetary Ecology (30)\n\nallow Terraforming (45) \u2014requires colony on the planet. each step on the EP wheel requires\n\nNanotech Production (80) + Orbital infrastructure (30)\n\nallows Advanced Terraforming (120) \u2014faster and only requires a colony in the same system\n\nIt may not be necessary to make more advanced terraforming cost less PP. Just being able to do it (much) faster is probably enough incentive to get the more expensive techs.\n\nIn your proposed new techs, do the later terraforming techs require the earlier ones?\n\nThe tech tree scripting should be trivial - just copy an existing theory tech or application that does nothing (there are a few) and change the stringtable entries and cost. Since there won't be anything to unlock and the techs won't have any direct effect, there's no complicated effects scripting to be done.\n\nTo make it possible to build a terraforming project, we'd need to add the capacity to add \"actions\" or \"projects\" or somesuch to the production queue. These would cost PP and take time to build, and when complete, would cause an effect to fire, probably for one turn. That effect would change the planet type (environment) in the case of terraforming projects.\n\nAlternatively, something like the above could be hacked with the current system by making a building that changes its planet's type once, then does nothing in subsequent turns. I forget if there's a destroy effect, but if so, the building could destory itself after firing the terraforming effect.\n\n(Aside: we might also want \"ongoing projects\" or somesuch, which cost PP each turn, but which also have effects that fire every turn...)\n\nAlso, FYI I've made (almost?) every tech cost 1 PP and take 1 turn to research in SVN. There's not much point in maintaining a pretense of balance at this point, especially when it comes at the cost of making things much slower to test.\n\nAlso also, there are ships in the tech tree now. You could make a tech that unlocks a nominal terraforming ship part, although it wouldn't yet do anything. See the techs in techs.txt that have names starting with SHP_ Unlocking is done in a manner resembling\n\nI kinda like the idea of having the game \"remember\" the original state of a planet. this way you can restrict terraforming to only changing environment by 1 or 2 steps(from native state) instead of changing it completely. (Stars! did something similar.)\n\nThat would pretty much remove Gaian Terraforming as a possibility* since Gaian is always the best for your race, or it is a self terraforming world that soon ends up as the best for your race, I forget witch was decided on.\n\n* Unless you were talking only about the earlier techs.\n\nAlthough I must say I like the idea of war affecting a planets environment, while it might make little sense in some cases the idea has merit so we should at least have a discussion on it.Another related possibility might be a partly terraformed planetary special that also makes a planet further away on the EP wheel, it depends on how expensive we want early game terraforming to be. there are numerous reasons why this might be realistic, massive terraforming inferstructure that is a drain on the economy until its finished and packed up. Sudden violent storms and floods as environment finishes assimilating the aritifical changes (or until the tech team irons out the bugs), it might even be semi-deliberate. Boiling off part of the sea would have serious effects on day to day life until the temperatures are back to normal.\n\nYes I meant the Early techs. But I was also considering the possibility of adding anti-terraforming techs. Like a bomb that causes a planet to revert either to, or towards, it's original state. Or maybe just move it away from it's current state. Or we could add techs for all three.\n\nIt may not be necessary to make more advanced terraforming cost less PP. Just being able to do it (much) faster is probably enough incentive to get the more expensive techs.\n\nI didn't suggest a lesser PP cost. I agree, being about to complete a terraform in (for instance) half the time would be a sufficient motivation to get the tech.\n\nGeoff the Medio wrote:\n\nIn your proposed new techs, do the later terraforming techs require the earlier ones?\n\nI was thinking it should require the earlier version of the tech, though i didn't make that clear.\n\nI've committed the first two terraforming techs, though the descriptions are rather quick.\n\nKrikkitone wrote:\n\nIs Terraforming going to require PP to build or Food?\n\nSince it's a building it requires PP: unless someone makes a sufficiently strong case that it should require Food.\n\nmarhawkman wrote:Tortanick wrote:\n\nAlthough I must say I like the idea of war affecting a planets environment...I like the general idea myself. Elsewhere i've mentioned specials such as \"exotic radiation\" and \"nanite swarms\" as the results of certain kinds of weapons which would permanently harm a planet (unless they are cleaned up).\n\nI like the idea that attacks or other events could harm or change the planet in some way... but it just doesn't make sense for that change to be movement around the EP wheel. Unless, of course the weapon is specifically some sort of late game \"Genesis Device\" terraforming weapon. somewhereso it doesn't just increase the speed, it increases the range\n\neleazar wrote:\n\nKrikkitone wrote:\n\nIs Terraforming going to require PP to build or Food?\n\nSince it's a building it requires PP: unless someone makes a sufficiently strong case that it should require Food.\n\nWell I thought that was one of the ideas of a potential use of food (to keep it from fading in importance as technology improved)Well, i agree that it's fun to gradually gain more abilities, which is different from marhawkman's idea of a hard limit on the range of terraforming.\n\nI would rather have the practical limit based on the undesirability of the starting EP of the colony. For instance if you colonized a planet with an extremely hostile environment (for your species) in order to terraform it to your ideal, you would still have to deal keep that colony alive while it was in it's beginning stages. That colony is certainly going to be a resource drain until it is terraformed near to your EP. If you compare the cost and time of actually making that colony useful, compared to starting with a colony closer to your EP, it will be a rather impractical choice nearly every time (assuming there are other options).\n\nWe have later techs (environmental encapsulation) which i think should make it easier to live on non-ideal EPs, and thus easier to terraform them.\n\nWe also might connect the speed of terraforming to the infrastructure meter (at least for early terraform techs) which would increase the difficulty of terraforming the more unsuitable worlds.\n\nQuote:.\n\nWith increasing Minerals you can also increase focus on Industry (essentially they are one usable resource produced by 2 seperate meters) and those PP are pretty much always useful... same with Research (until Transcendance is reached) Money... well we aren't really doing anything with it yet\n\nbut Food becomes less and less important as tech improves\n\nAs for the limit on how much you can terraform a world... I wouldn't go with Just a practical limit as opposed to a hard (tech determined) limit on the range [My idea was an increase in range of terraforming... in the ability to do a farther Range of terraforming like I'm assuming marhawkman's idea was (not that there would be a permanent lmit to the range)]\n\nThe practical limit should be there... the total change from Inferno to Terran should be longer and more expensive than the change from Ocean to Terran. However, the Ability to go from Inferno to Terran should also be later than the Ability to go from Ocean to Terran.\n\nFood probably will probably require less focus as the game progresses, which is the intention, and there's nothing wrong with that. You expect a more advanced civilization to put less of it's total effort into feeding itself.\n\nBut the idea that tech increases food production but can't increase max population is groundless. We have techs like N-Dimensional structures, planetary Rings, and Environmental Encapsulation, etc. Even if you didn't know about these techs, why in the world wouldn't we have something like them?\n\nIn addition, a thriving empire (i.e. one that's not loosing) will probably be more or less continually adding new planets through colonization and conquest.\n\nWell, i agree that it's fun to gradually gain more abilities, which is different from marhawkman's idea of a hard limit on the range of terraforming.\n\nIt's not really a hard limit. It's an alternative to automatically moving from step to step when terraforming. Since we're doing a \"wheel\" instead of a graded scale like MoO2 did, going through steps in sequence doesn't make as much sense. Especially since you won't necessarily be going the same direction each game. It adds two more things though. It lets you have limitations on terraforming and gives a reason to have and research multiple levels of terraforming techs. It also makes terraforming no longer strictly a one-way street. This approach greatly facilitates the usage of techs with negative consequences.\n\nCan we treat terraforming as strictly an increase in max population size?\n\nIf the only effects were increases in population limit, then we wouldn't really be terraforming, as the environment type wouldn't be changing, which is basically the definition of \"terraforming\". You can argue that there shouldn't be terraforming, in the sense of changing environments, but I don't think we should redefine the term.\n\nHandling terraforming in a more discreet, abstract fashion has it's advantages. You can still have gaian specials and stuff like that, but the convoluted nature of the EP chart lends itself poorly to strict changes in the environment. The player shouldn't have much to keep track of, but failing that it should be predictable and simple.\n\nedit: hmmm. I don't want to redefine terraforming, just the way it's presented"}

{"text": "Because the Expanse has dozens of Rogue Traders, and the Imperium presumably has a lot of various designs. Even if I don't have official stats for them, it's nice to be able to say when people cruise into Footfall that there are a bunch of different designs and give the names that they can't find in the book. Unfortunately, that usually means they then want those ships for their own, so I need to make stats.\n\nIf you've automated the whole generation process then adding in more information becomes much less dauntingparticularly considering that most Rogue Trader groups will only ever have one of them.\n\nI'm not willing to bet that this is true. Most may start with only one, but players in a long game are likely to gain more. It's like wondering why D&D had so many spells of 6th-level and beyond. Most groups never get that far, but for those that do, you need something substantial there to work towards. I'd ventrue to say that most RT groups that don't get beyond one ship are not the ones that buy heavily into suppliments and are less frequent posters on boards such as this.\n\nFor my own group, our first campaign had grown the fleet to 14 vessels (mostly transports). Our current game's RT is the grandson of the last game's RT (a still living, but mostly retired holder of the WoT) and is in command of a frigate to prove his worth. The rest of the fleet is stil out there - some controlled by rival siblings."}
{"text": "Some of these forces I know little about, though many are also dependent on what time frame one is looking at....\n\nBattletech: Is at best in the single digit kilotons (though some high end calcs can put them in the low triple digit kilotons), it lacks gravity generation and energy shields, it's FTL drive is capable but highly restrictive, sub light speeds is restricted to less than 15 gravity's (acceleration).\n\nStarwars: Most calculations often put it in the megaton to gigaton range for it's capital weapons, they have shields that can take this energy and can generate gravity (not to mention a less restrictive FTL drive, thats vastly faster), sub light speeds are hard to put down but in the dozens of gravitys.\n\nStartrek: Most calcs put them in the megaton range, with energy shields ships capable of withstanding these energys, they also have gravity generation for their crews, and a less restrictive FTL drive (though B-tech is roughly on par speed wise), sub light speeds are similar to Starwars.\n\nGundam: using the Universal century figures, they have good firepower but low armor, no shields, low fuel endurance / acceleration rates (Earth to moon ~2 days), they also have no FTL drives nor gravity generation.\n\nMacross: I know little about it's tech but I am familiar with it. It depends on the time frame, by Frontier their fighters have better acceleration rates than B-techs, at the lest their some what better than B-tech in most departments.\n\nZone of Enders: I know nothing about this game\nEve Online: I also know nothing about this game\n\nStarcraft is very hard to get reliable calculations but it's above B-tech but below Starwars/Startrek in the capital ship departments.\nI do know that Terran Marines use a rifle with the effective capability's of a 50 cal HMG.\n\n---------------------------------------------\nThough Battletech dose have some good infantry kits, it's battlearmor is quite good, their ground weapons are powerful but their \"range\" is at the lest problematic.

Like Trek, they pop antimatter warheads like candy, and their other ordinance is no less powerful. Their on-board FTL systems are capable of 6AU/s, which matches the best Trek FTL estimates I've ever seen (backstage or calculated from, say, time estimates on Voyager's trip across the galaxy). They also have a network of very fast FTL conduits which basically surpass anything I've ever seen elsewhere (admitted that that's just to make the game playable), again, save maybe the poor forgotten Stargate franchise. That said, there's little evidence of any kind of abundance of exotic tech in EVE.\n\nFleet sizes for all of EVE come from ~300,000 players, so we'll just call it roughly that many combat ships. That puts the entire EVE universe, across all races, roughly on par with Trek, across all the major players who might take place in any conflict (so no Borg).\n\nOn the whole, I'd probably rate EVE and Trek to generally be on par with each other (with Trek having better exotic tech, but vastly inferior FTL). All of humanity in EVE would probably beat the Federation by numbers, but not necessarily the Federation/Klingons/Romulans and assorted other races who might take part in a galactic war, which might include the Dominion, Cardassians, Breen, and a few other major relatively players.For the anime robot franchises, there's little specific data, but my impression is that, based on what I've seen, they just don't have the energy outputs to compete with the above franchises.In short, wherever you'd fit franchises specifically, Trek, EVE, and Starcraft would probably all fight for the top, while BT would be stuck at or near the bottom. everything and made it a billion billion times more powerful).\n\nDon't like it to bad it's canon, Their are however accounts of the deathstar consuming enough energy firing it's main weapon that would of been produced by a (several?) main sequence star over a week, the Mk II is stated to have been vastly more powerful (IIRC Hundreds of super giant stars). So technobabble or not the power requirements are considerable.\n\nThough it's funny you knock Starwars for this particular bit of technobabble and yet do not mention any of the vast amounts of technobabble that Star trek uses in many of it's episodes.\n\nThough technically IIRC the Death star had hypermatter reactors for quite some time in real life, as even Antimatter reactors are just to inefficient to power the stations planet busting shot (Which is around 1E33-38 Joules IIRC, your looking at a not so small amount of antimatter if it was one). Though hypermatter reactors do use fusion reactors to regulate them (It seems hypermatter reactors are a form of A/AM reactors in any case).\n\nAlso note that even ISDs are said to use more energy in a single hyperspace jump than a planet (inhabited) in it's life time and the bigger ships equal the power production of main sequence stars at full power.\n\nQuoteDon't like it to bad, crying about it dose not invalidate that starwars can be that powerful via these books. Though I will give you this many debaters tend to limit their use of info from the ICS for various reasons.\n\nAlso note lower canon can be over ruled by higher canon if theirs a direct contradiction.\n\nAnd technically your objectivity on the subject can be questionable as well. TheThough IIRC part of the reasoning behind these firepower levels comes from the stated ability of ISDs being able to slag worlds by them selves in only a few hours.\nTheirs also the Dodanna quote which technically would make SW have even more firepower than the ICS values... (SW4 during the rebel briefing on the death star it was mentioned that the death star has firepower greater than half the starfleet... based off the energy used to blow up a planet, and spread it to the starfleet, gives each ship massive amounts of firepower).\n\nQuote\n\nSo before even getting into Wars, we'd have to talk about what to include and exclude, and what to go with over the mass number of contradictions caused by the EU writers not being satisfied with the established lore.\n\nThis is true for MOST series, as even Trek is hardly a bastion of consistency.\n\nQuoteNot really. TheThough even their use of FTL combat is rare and some times contradictory (IIRC theirs even one time where even though they where at warp they where decidedly not at FTL speeds -I.e. IIRC counting down range in ~100,000km intervals every second or so and not sounding rushed).\n\nThough the trek M/AM reactor also uses technobabble as well...\n\nOn the other hand lets not get into a debate with SW and Trek as that road can lead to many a flame war.\n\nQuoteNever assume that when one uses one type of power generation that it must mean they have the same ability's of another universe that has a similar device. Or in other words even if they both have anti mater reactors one could have vastly better power generation than the other. Or one my have anti mater the other oh lets say some sort of fusion reactor and the \"fusion\" produces far more power....\n\nQuote\n\nFor the anime robot franchises, there's little specific data, but my impression is that, based on what I've seen, they just don't have the energy outputs to compete with the above franchises.\n\nMacross can give a decent showing but is not as capable as the others on the list, Gundam is not as capable as Macross.\n\nQuoteI will agree with you their, though battletech can edge out gundam, but its not quite as capable as Macross.\nAnd if you want ground combat it can do even better.\n\nthis kind of topic makes me wish bandai namco would put in battletech in a Super Robot War game...also with macross and gundam in the same game so that battletech meets it's biggest eastern influences.\n\nRemember, the SDF-1 was a small destroyer landed on earth, an abandoned part of the Supervision Army's fleet left as a booby trap for Breetai's Zentradi. The ship was then salvaged and jury rigged together by late 20th century humanity. In its prime, the SDF-1 Macross could fire a beam ten thousand miles long and a mile wide, capable of destroying everything in its path. It also sported the Omni Directional Shield Barrier, which, when it malfunctioned, turned Montreal into a crater. Which is why they continued to employ the essentially impenetrable pinpoint shields.\n\nThis same technology, expounded on by humans, created such weapons as the Grand Cannon, a weapon that was able to wipe out thousands of ships across a hemisphere of earth in one sweep.\n\nSure, the zentradi's planetary bombardment was pretty weak in the grand scheme of planet breaking. But the size, volume, and power of their ships (Numbering in the hundreds of thousands), and allied with the new Protoculture of earth, combined with the techonology that later created respectable fleets of Macross class carriers and resulted in humanity populating a significant portion of the galaxy, probably has the edge.\n\nNebfer, I don't have a horse in this race, since frankly, I think pretty much every franchise here is downright silly in most respects. It's part of why we love them, but it also means that I consider any such analysis to be rather silly, and only half-scientific to begin with, because these are universes where weapons can spontaneously change power, FTL scales can grow and shrink and grow again on a whim, and ships can spontaneously gain and lose size, all for no reason at all.\n\nWith that said, you're grossly oversimplifying, if not entirely misrepresenting, Star Wars canon.\n\nThe ICS books, and any other books along with games, or whatever other material, may be canon EU, but canon Star Wars consists of the screenplays, films, film novelizations, radio plays. This is the canon policy that has been consistently maintained, by Lucas himself, and Lucasarts, consistently, for years.\n\nLucas Licensing has released statements that are somewhat contradictory, but you know what? George Lucas is the franchise owner; he outranks Lucas Licensing, no matter what any of their employees have said.\n\nAt best, anything outside of that, including Saxton's ICS books, can be called part of the EU canon, the continuity recognized by Lucas Licensing, as distinct from what's recognized by Lucas himself, as part of his franchise.\n\nIf you want to include EU, we can include EU in this discussion. I'd be happy to bring in discussions of the Genesis Wave series by John Vornholt, or plenty of other ridiculous tales of absurd forces, but I'm under the assumption we're sticking to strict canon here, such as the novelizations, which repeatedly, throughout (even in the prequel novelizations) refer to Star Wars power generation as fusion, and nothing more.\n\nQuote\n\nTheI entirely agree, which is why I wouldn't use The Die is Cast to generally judge normal Trek weaponry, but to use your own logic on the high-end figures, it's canon, so tough luck.\n\nThe easiest explanation for the TDiC explosions would simply be special ordinance, or it could be a product of the reaction of materials not hardened to the rapid nadion effect of phasers (in use by the Cardassian Keldon class vessels), and the equivalent effects from Romulan disruptors.\n\nIt shouldn't be any surprise, given mention of the ability of simple hand weapons to vaporize entire large buildings (TNG frame of mind).\n\nBut I'm not in the habit of taking wild guesses of how much such things might play into these instances, anymore than I'm inclined to guess on the lower-end instances (the Pegasus episode is a perfect example).\n\nFor Trek, I usually stick to the ~250PJ range for warheads (give or take), since it's fairly solidly grounded in the annihilation of matter and antimatter in the quantities we're talking about, and then just assume phasers have roughly equal effectiveness. It's not a perfect approach, especially because, like any sci-fi, Trek has hillarious outliers on both sides of that figure (and because some of M/AM reactions go to useless neutrino production), but I find it usually gets me by.\n\nQuote\n\nTheIn a perfect world, I might be able to assume that every natural scientist is an objective individual, and that that objectivity extends to all aspects of their lives, but if I was ever that naive, it's been long since beaten out of me by seeing gross misconduct far beyond simple lack of objectivity, by scientists. It's not something I'd attribute to many, as indeed, the requirements of working in the sciences requires those of us in those fields is conducive to objective thinking, but there are exceptions to every rule, especially when dealing with human beings.\n\nIf I can watch, say, Patrick Michaels, walk into Congress and lie right through his teeth to them about HIS OWN FIELD, then I certainly would not put it past an equally passionate scientist to throw mere objectivity to the wind on something so ancillary was VS debates. Put simply, Saxton's status as a scientist guarantees nothing.\n\nHis mere status as a vs debater also doesn't guarantee anything, save the fact that he has never been a bastion of objectivity, and his behavior in VS debates has always been charged and vitriolic.\n\nAnd if you think his figures are merely extrapolations of his observations of canon, then first, it should be noted that pro-Wars debates have grossly inflated estimates from VFX and canonical statements to begin with, and secondly, those figures are irreconciblable with the canon novelizations.\n\nLet's take the Death Star, for instance:\n\nQuote\n\nTheir are however accounts of the deathstar consuming enough energy firing it's main weapon that would of been produced by a (several?) main sequence star over a week\n\nThe problem is that you're assuming the Death Star is a DET weapon; this cannot be the case.\n\nYour figures are actually low-balled (IIRC, the Death star uses YEARS of output from a star), but there's a problem with that.\n\nLet's refer to the Death Star I explosion, from the exploding reactor, as described in the ANH novelization:\n\nQuote\n\n\"Space filled temporarily with trillions of microscopic metal fragments, propelled past the retreating ships by the liberated energy of a small artificial sun.\"\n\nNow look at the phrasing there: the liberated energy of a small artificial sun. This clearly refers to a fusion reactor. If it was just trying to quantify the energy, it wouldn't have used the word articificial, nor is there any phrasing to indicate a comparitive statement to begin with.\n\nBut let's not dwell on one example.\n\nCurtis Saxton has no problem using entirely EU sources that are not part of the Star Wars canon, including magazines, comics, video games.\n\nPro-Wars debates constantly try to claim that Saxton's E2 ICS book was based on careful examination of the film, but nothing could be further from the truth: \n\nBut Saxton also has no problem basing his books entirely off of fan-based inflations of canon, something I don't have to bring up because you already did:\n\nQuote\n\nThough IIRC part of the reasoning behind these firepower levels comes from the stated ability of ISDs being able to slag worlds by them selves in only a few hours.\n\nThis is exactly what I'm talking about. That's not canon Star Wars! That's Base Delta Zero you're referring to, and not only is that is in no way part of Lucas' Star Wars, but in the way it's used by Saxton in the ICS books, it's not even canon EU!\n\nThe idea of slagging an entire planet is a big tall tale of fiction, based on nothing canonical, in Star Wars, or Star Wars EU, that's basically nothing but one big fan inflation to create a tale of something that never actually happened in canon.\n\nIt started as something real, at least in EU, a work called \"Scavenger Hunt\", which described the bombardment of a single Rebel base (not the entire surface of a planet), but the fans cherry picked words, until the tale grew and grew, and Curtis Saxton used it for figures in his E2 ICS book, which was then cited by others... until it became an entrenched part of EU canon, that never really was, and was just made up by some of the more fanatical fans.\n\nBut it gets better than figures that are merely innocently made up out of nothing.\n\nSaxton got help with his ICS figures, by corresponding with other pro-Wars debates, who EXPLICITLY STATED that they were producing the figures they were SPEFICALLY to make Star Wars stronger than Star Trek, in correspondence with the same people you see credited in the ICS books by Saxton (namely, Mike Wong and Wayne Poe).\n\nThat was the stated goal behind much of the work that produced the ICS figures, not to make ICS books that were consistent with Star Wars canon, or that were scientifically sound, but specifically to write the ICS books out to make Star Wars stronger than Star Trek.\n\nYou're right; there's no way to prove my objectivity, but the notion of objectivity underlying the ICS books is laughable at best.\n\nSo where do we go from here?\n\nYou want to discuss Star Wars, WHICH Star Wars? The actual franchise, owned by George Lucas, or the EU continuity, and its myriad of inflated or downright made up figures that don't in any way even relate to the original canon?\n\nWhere do you want to draw that line?\n\nThis is why I pretty much just choose to not touch Star Wars.\n\nQuote\n\nThis is true for MOST series, as even Trek is hardly a bastion of consistency.\n\nTo some extent? Perhaps.\n\nBut no series is self-crippled to the sheer extent that Star Wars is, because no series suffers the particular problems of fan-inflated and intentionally biased figures, conjured up in relation to canon out of thin air for the express purpose of inflation, completely independent of the very canon its supposed to describe, not to the extent that Star Wars does.\n\nWho knows, maybe in a war, Star Wars would beat any franchise out there, but I can't answer a question of who would win a fight with such problems making such a muddy situation out of what information should even be included in the first place."}
{"text": "Played factions are factions that contain player characters and role-playing plots. They are the heart of the site's roleplay and are living, ever-changing entities made possible by combined effort of multiple people. Played factions should have a comprehensive collection of information about them on the wiki.\n\nBackground Factions are setting resources usable by all GMs. These could be:\n\nEnemy factions to serve as opponents in plots.\n\nAlien factions to add flavor and variety to the universe.\n\nA starter for a player faction that hasn't opened plots yet.\n\nIt is important that each faction have a purpose and a use: if you're building a faction as a static personal display piece or one that no one is using, you're doing it wrong. Connect to other factions in the setting.\n\nBackground factions usually have a person in creative control of them. Please be respectful to their creation and consult them before using the faction if possible. Background factions are not used as the equivalent of player characters; Star Army is a character-based roleplay, not one where each player has/plays a personal faction or Empire. Once you make the species, it's for everyone.\n\nIt's okay for player characters to be from a background faction. In fact, this can be a great way to flesh the faction out.\n\nStar Army doesn't have a pressing need for more played factions. There are a number of minor played factions short on players. At the same time, there's a need of more diverse (more alien) background ones because existing factions are fairly similar. For these reasons, we recommend that, if you wish to create a new faction, you start out by making them a background faction. You can always upgrade them later to a played faction if there's enough player support.\n\nThe easiest way to make a new species obviously inhuman is to give them non-human heads. If they have a human head, there should be some plausible reason why.\n\nBe willing to work hard. Respect the process. Ideas formulate easily. Making those ideas into a reality is a long, arduous process which is largely thankless. You need to look inward and seriously ask yourself if you have the determination to work at something for months or even years before it picks up enough steam to run on its own.\n\nUnrealistic expectations are the death of a creation. Expect to start at the bottom of the ladder and slowly work your way up. There are no shortcuts.\n\nUnderstand that you will have to run a plotship, so you're going to do double duty as FM/GM. Can you handle this workload?\n\nYour faction/race should work to benefit the setting, to fit as a piece in the grander puzzle, not to act against it. What does your faction/race contribute to the community that fills a need? Your ideas are important, but remember that when you submit something for approval, it isn't only about you but how your creation serves the whole.\n\nMany factions/species fall by the wayside because they don't appeal to the player base at large. Usually, a faction/species is created by one person and this results in a narrowing of perspective.\n\nWhile you're making your creation, step back several times and ask yourself these questions: How is my creation going to get players? What interesting things can I highlight that make the casual observer stand back and go \"Wow. That's something I can really sink my teeth into.\"?\n\nThink of what you can do with your creation after they're approved. What exactly are they going to do? What roleplay stories can you tell?\n\nAs more and more species/factions are created, they tend to bleed together and there's a greater need to have your creation stand out. But if your species is too foreign, players will have difficulty relating to and identifying with them.\n\nTake comments from the NTSE community, admins and players. Pitch ideas. Find out what gets their interest and what is a little too far out there. Work within these boundaries as you craft your creation.\n\nThe Golden Rule of race creation is race approval is a privilege, not a right. Just because you spent a lot of time on writing your species, worked hard on it, and you want to change it so it's approvable that doesn't mean it will be approved. If a reviewer dubs your creation unsuitable for SARP and you cause a large amount of drama over it you may be prohibited from submitting new additions in the future. However, if you take it in stride and carefully listen to their advice, there's always hope your submission can be revised and resubmitted at a future date.\n\nStarting at a lower technology level is okay. If you start as an advanced species it may make it harder to explain the lack of encounters with your race so far in the IC timeline, as well as make the staff wary of potential power gaming.\n\nWe frown on so many species starting with heavily industrialized nations on very resource rich homeworlds, or those that have some miraculous new wonder fuel/substance totally unique to them that exponentially increases their power.\n\nThat means you shouldn't call yourselves a separate race if you're really just humans with special powers, minor cosmetic changes, or an extra organ or two. Staff usually really dislike this, though there is a small possibly to convince staff to forgo this if your species submission is unique and well-written enough. Still, be forewarned that this alone may be grounds for the denial of a submission; the setting already has more than enough pseudohuman species.\n\nIf you can't easily interchange the word \"alien\" with \"creature\" consider upping the strangeness.\n\nThis is a big one. This means avoid making your species stronger, faster, smarter, and longer-lived than humans with bonus powers to boot (such as telepathy, heightened senses, etc), while at the same time having absolutely no weaknesses, or negligible weaknesses that don't really bother them too much. Emphasis on the \"negligible weakness\" part; trying to pass of a weakness as being vulnerable to bullets, poison, or gamma radiation just won't cut it. Also consider that making the race too powerful may lead to potential power gaming issues on behalf of future players, so keep any racial abilities at a reasonable level.\n\nTelepathy should be avoided. In the past so many species were submitted with telepathy that it became very, very cliche in SARP. In addition, there is also the potential powergaming/metagaming in regards to potential players of telepathic races which have caused trouble in SARP's past. For this reason it is strongly recommended you avoid any sort of extrasensory perceptions along the lines of mind-reading.\n\nThe mysterious evil alien attackers and/or overlords and/or monsters has been done to death. Having an antagonist species rule over yours is fine, but make sure you give it depth to avoid the aforementioned cliche.\n\nTry not to make your race one that has a perfect corruption free government, and whose entire citizenship is always extremely virtuous to the point of dying for righteousness, and so on. Just about every race should have its flaws, scumbags, criminals, and dissidents. If your race doesn't have these types, make sure you also consider the negative impacts.\n\nFor example, a race without crime or corruption may be that way because they are religious zealots who exile nonbelievers and criminals from their cities. Another example might be a police state carries extremely heavy punishments for criminals, such as torture and execution.\n\nWhat is meant by this is having your race possess a unique martial art, swordfighting technique, or mastery over Ki that allows a single person to decimate an entire squad of infantry. Having unique fighting arts is fine; just be sure to keep the power levels reasonable given their technology level. Also keep in mind your race's society; a pacifistic free society shouldn't have very many citizens well-versed in the art of fighting.\n\nExamples of what to avoid: An ancient sword technique that allows your race's swordfighters to block bullets, or a traditional martial art that gives your fighters the ability to punch through battle armor.\n\nTry to avoid having any materials totally unique to this race or planet that totally compensates for their lack of technology. This is essentially attempting to exploit or avoid the technology limitations of starting races, and is generally frowned upon. It's also considered quite cliche to have a special resource that naturally occurs on your planet, but nowhere else in the entire galaxy.\n\nExamples of what to avoid: Ancient alien artifacts that give you a totally unique and copyrighted weapon that no one else has. A natural super-potent power source that allows your predominantly low-tech race to match the weapons technology of interstellar empires. An ore unique to your planet that allows knights with plate armor to withstand laser fire.\n\nNow that your faction/race is created, you need to work on getting players. One of the biggest things you can do is create something that binds the elements of your creation together. It could be a war, it could be a critical cultural event or something else entirely, but make it something that all players can get behind. If nothing else, it serves as a critical reference point to bring everyone back to.\n\nAll causes need leaders to put a face on them. For your faction or species, make someone who represents the cause and pushes it forward. If not one person, make several notable PC/NPCs who represent the 'essence' of the species/faction. And make them visible. Very visible. Leaders need to be seen.\n\nThe first few players who join your faction will make or break it. Goodwill, as well as negativity, is contagious. Work hard to make them happy.\n\nOne of the easiest ways to do this is to let them in on the process of managing the faction/species. Give them power, little by little at first. (This becomes important later on). Make them feel like they have a say in matters. Nobody likes being yanked on a leash.\n\nRun your plot. Show that you're active and dedicated enough to see things through.\n\nPlayers come up with wild ideas. Aethersperm, Admiral Davis's Fishsticks, national holidays celebrating gun exchange. These little touches add so much to a faction/species. Some will be a bit messy. Just run with them. Throw them against the wall and see what sticks. Your players will appreciate your flexibility. Give your faction character and a sense of humor.\n\nNow that your faction/species has wings of its own, it's time for the endgame. These are two of the hardest steps, but they are two of the most essential ones.\n\nIf and when you've reached a point where your creation no longer needs you tending to it so closely. It's time to respect what your creation has become and step into the role of adviser instead of leader. Advise, do not demand.\n\nTom: What I did with Nepleslia was form a group of trusted players who I treated as equals. These were players who were with me from the early days of Nepleslia and who I worked closely with. Because I had treated them so well in the past, let them in on the process, they respected my opinions when I brought them up. I only stepped in directly when there were disagreements and an 'official' ruling had to be made. And because a foundation of goodwill had been built over the years, everyone respected the decisions made. If you've made it to this point, you've done a great job.\n\nYou can't be by your creation's side forever. There comes a point when the community takes over and your faction becomes something greater than what you originally imagined. It'll move in directions you hadn't anticipated. The worst thing you can do is cling to your creation. It's hard to do, but be willing to let go and step away.\n\nPlace the faction/species in the hands of your trusted players with the understanding that they too, will have to do this same thing some day. That way, the faction/species will continue to grow years after you've left and become a self-sustaining force in the community.\n\nThis isn't saying that you can't come back. Just don't feel entitled. You know your community will welcome you back if you've done a good job.\n\nDesignating an assistant and/or backup FM who can run his faction should the FM become indisposed\n\nFaction Managers do not necessarily have the ability to approve articles (that falls to staff of New Technologies and Setting Elements). However, all articles must be approved by the appropriate faction manager before the NTSE staff can approve"}

{"text": "snakemen and ethereals will be in the game?\n\nI the original my fav alien race was the snakemen, but i have seen no reference to them in the video's and articals i've see. Do you think the will be in the new version and if so do you think that the reason that they haven't been listed is beacuse they are aliens that you meet later in the game like the ethereals which have also not been listed.\n\nI for one hope they are in the games as it was a sign as to how far you were in to the game as to what alien you were facing.\n\nIf you check the E3 trailer there's a brief scene by the end where you can see chained Sectoids and a tall lean dark figure in the background, which some consider to be the first glimpse of the Ethereal.\nI'm expecting Snakemen to be revealed later - the only two original aliens that I'm not expecting to see are the Silacoid and the Celatid.\n\nI also can't imagine the game without ethereals, but since they are the late game alien race, I think they're probably not showing them to preserve a sense of awe when players see them in the game for the first time.\n\nIf you are talking about the armored aliens that materialize on the beginning of the E3 trailer, it can be the Snakemen although my bet is that it's a new species. There's a demo being commented by Jake Solomon where he mentions that the Drones can repair robotic units like the Cyberdisk, so my guess is that we haven't seen all the robotic species yet.\n\nI'd be really amazed if Snakemen aren't in. As for abilities, as I 've said before, let them make some use of the fifty eggs they carry inside them. Also, maybe they should have a melee tail-whip attack.\n\nWell like any good serpent like race maybe they got harden scales that provide extra kinetic and laser defense. They could camoflauge themselves or have regenerative health. They can spot your units better because they see in infrared?\n\nYeah but they were a joke/harmless on the original game since by the time you encountered them you'd be wearing Power Suits. I'd wish that they bring them back to Alien Base missions though.\n\nWhat makes you think alien base missions are gone? There's been no evidence that they're removed.\n\nOT: Ethereals definitely in, it's my gut but still...Sadly I agree with this. Snakemen in the original were pretty much a non-issue even you were still using conventional weaponry so long as they didn't bring any Chryssalids with them. However, given what Firaxis did with the Floater (another very low threat enemy IMO) I think they can and will do something super neat with the Snakeman.\n\nIt could be cool if snakemen could spit venom that would temporarily blind a foe (like a cobra), lowering their attack percentages greatly (and make them sitting ducks for Chrysalids) or if they could use a constrict attack when next to a foe that could kill them in 2-3 rounds (making their melee attack less dangerous than that of the berserker, but still lethal if your squad member is alone; plus, they use guns when in a distance -- think of them as a mixture of Muton and Berserker -- a jack of all trades, but a master of none)\n\nWhat makes you think alien base missions are gone? There's been no evidence that they're removed.\n\nOh, that's not what I meant at all. What I was saying is that I hope that they make an appearance during assaults on Alien Bases on the remake. For some reason I see Silacoids being used by the aliens to dig up alien bases (since they eat rock), while Celatids could be deployed as patrolling watchdogs - if they spotted an XCOM unit their first action would be to multiply themselves, as it is described on the original's UFOPaedia article.\n\nEthereals will have to be in. It's not X-Com without Ethereals. I do hope that there will be some way to boost psi-defences, though... nothing was worse than finding out that your three best soldiers are complete psi-wimps... finding out by having to watch them wipe out your entire squad, of course.\n\nas for the Snakemen, I don't know either. Then again, they have soooo much creepiness-potential... I hope they turned them into something really amazing.\n\nDoes anybody else think that the weird crystal-morphing-into-armored-humanoid aliens might be the replacement for silacoids? non-organic beings... rock-like... \"silacoid\" kind of alludes to \"silicon\", as in computers/androids... I don't know if that's too far-fetched, though."}

{"text": "I can understand from a balancing standpoint you don't want the 1 ship tanking 50 ships because its godly and whatnot but its countering most of your ability descriptions, aux power to structural 2 can easilly hit 76%, stack it with brace for impact for 55% and throw in a polarize hull or hazard systems for another 15ish and you get a whopping 51%, and thats if you use 3 engineering consoles for resists....\n\nso many abilities increase your resists by this % and that % but those %'s are almost irrelevant as you will easilly hit the 'soft cap\" of 45% and anything passed that barely gets you over 50, maybe 51%. so many abilities can hit that cap by themselves its pointless to even put what %'s they increase since it's irrelevant.\n\nwhats everyone elses thoughts on % resists and shields/armor and soft caps? both now and with the changes coming on tribble?ok so 10000 * (100 / (51 + 100)) = 6662.516556\n\nand 10000/6662.516556 = 50.0934357% damage taken, meaning 49.1ish% absorbed...so really its a big complex formula for getting roughly the same exact number as mitigating actual damage? I think what you were getting at and what the confusion is, is that the % shown on the ships defense screen is actually POST that formula and not PRE like most mmo's do(or used to do if it has suddenly changed in the last year).\n\nIf what is displayed is pre then that formula doesn't make sense because it already caps at 50% despite what you do, post makes more sense in how they get that number.\n\nWhich basically just sumes up my post the same question? why the cap around 50%? especially when it only takes 1 or 2 abilities or a couple pieces of equipment to get there? your not really trading off much to get that resistance defense on your hull and not have roughly the same offensive abilities you had before, seems like if you wanted to max your ship out for defense you should have a defensive advantage over someone who focused on offense an there really isn't much there because of how easy it is to hit such a low cap?\n\nI don't think you quite understood the formula the 'resistance' part is the tooltip bonuses not what your ship readout says, you seem to have used the final value that the ship readout says. ie this is the formula to arrive at what the readout says given your tooltip stats.\n\nIf you had 4 consoles that add +30% resist each, the number you'd plug into that equation is 120, which would result in a 55% (roughly) absorption. It's not capped at 50% as such, I think it's just hard to get over that.\n\nBut yes, the paperdoll/readout screen shows the post-calculation number, not the tooltip values that went into it. Ideally I think they should show both, but then, people might be even more confused."}

My tin'ead-playing friend quickly lost confidence in his Monoliths after 2 howling mobz of ork boyz charged in with several S9 PK attacks that immobilized them to make it easy pickings for my Deff Dreadz that closed in.\n\nBut so far out of everything it seems that all of the people I play with are most astonished at the ork upgrades for our vehicles, especially the 5-point grot riggers and RPJ which in conjunction with a nearby KFF makes them tear their hair in frustration....ah good times...good times..\n\n--------------------\n\nMy advice to you is to get married, if you have a good wife you'll be happy; if you get a bad one you'll become a philosopher.\n\nI've had someone think that his dreadknight would be more than a match for killa kans.\n\nDid he forget to roll 2d6 armor pen? Everybody always forgets that freaking thing is an MC! And the doomfists (default wargear) count as DCCW's. So he's str 10, + 2d6 armor pen (every hit is a pen vs a kan). If he upgraded it to a sword, he gets to reroll both misses, and armor pen rolls (or wounds)! It's a lot more of a slouch if you play it at str 6, and without the MC 2d6 armor pen.\n\nI'd say that ork shooting is always underestimated by a huge amount. I've wiped out half a squad of terminators with some trukk boyz before...in the shooting phase!\n\n--------------------\n\nShoota Boyz in a Battlewagon are insanity. BS of 2 is amazing! You can't miss with 120 shots!I have also encountered this one. Some people seem to the the WAAAGH is an ability of the warboss, and I don't really know why. There is also a lot of confusion about Ghazghul's special waaagh, but I'll let that slide because he's a special character. Another one I've heard though is that the waaagh allows your units to automatically rally, as if they were beakies. That's a misconception that I wish was true!Finally, one I've found is that people often overestimate the power of lootas. They imagine what carnage those guns could cause in the hands of their Beakies and instantly target the lootas to die. We of course can use this to our advantageYou know, I've been playing orks for years and misread that one myself\n\n\"I just print out cossack's posts on plasticard, and slowly fashion them into deff dread's over time, and then kill things with them.\" - greggles \"yey my forum hero is back, welcome back cossack! been boring around here without you.\" - Big Lone \"And Cossack is the NICE one here!\" - Shabbadoo \"I gotta agree with Cossack. Go back to your friends, and tell them that Orkz are indeed broken, but that you'll continue to play them because they're absolute beasts, the likes of which have not been seen in years. Then tell them how delicious their tears are and that you'll be using them to fuel and lubricate the emerald warmachine that is your WAAAGH!\" - Boss Gobbstompa\n\nI had someone say that lootas are the worst units in the codex, which is obviously sluggas in trukks... (kidding, slugga-trukks are awesome, long as there's more than one )\n\nbut in seriousness... *re-engages serious face*\n\ni had a grey knight player say it was suicide charging his unit of paladins with my grots. first thing they did was fail a psychic test, then they mostly ballsed-up their rolls and killed 3 grots, and they lost 2 wounds in return. i passed the check, and won the game because he was stuck there & couldn't reach the objective in time.\n\nI've also had grey knight players (there's a lot of them at my gaming store... ...the bandwagon must be heaving...) say there's no way any unit can stand against their death-cult assassins (that what they're called?). both times, i've not only survived the charge, but won the combat and wiped them out. once with tzeench possessed who rolled power-weapons, and once with nobz and a warboss vs 9 assassins and a special character who (naturally) boosts all their stuff somehow.\n\ni still love when people say 'orks can't shoot' it's like saying the rain's inaccurate, because most of it misses you - you're still blooming soaked though!\n\na common misconception overall is that ordnance can't fire if you move - it's only indirect fire (barrage) that neccesitates a stationary firing position.\n\nanother is that if a SAG mek explodes himself, vehicles are penetrated in the blast - far as it reads, it seems models are removed entirely - the '6,6' result is like a S:D shot, the '1,1' is more like a vortex explosion (which makes sense, considering the powers involved).\n\nOrks can't shoot -Enemy proceeds to be shot off objective as the opponent all but gives up the shooting phase thinking mine couldn't amount to much. -Is astonished by the sheer number of Dice I roll during the shooting phases and gets scared regardless of what I actually accomplish.\n\nOrks can't handle heavy Armor, and our best unit for anti-armor (tankbustas) suck -I race trukk mobs out with a PK next to their tank and rip it to pieces -I field a small tankbusta mob that the enemy forgets about until I open up with multiple rockets -I run squads of TL Rokkit armed buggies around the field blowing shit up. -Tankbustas well they do suck considering how many points we pay for them. I won't argue that point, but I still use them. -three batteries of three ork cannons each, I haven't tried this one yet but I have a feeling I might be on to something with it.\n\nOrks aren't good combat anymore -Eats genestealers with standard shoota boys in CC -Smashes beakie combat squads apart with slugga boys -Laughes when Dreadnoughts get into CC with units without a PF (was seeing a lot more of those before I stopped playing regularly)\n\nOrks only have and are good at 'plan A' also known as get'em, and need to get into close combat -Shot the crap out of one of those lone wolf character death seekers out of the space wolf book instead of assaulting him and letting him use his 100pts of CC wargear on me. Oh the look on my friend's face was priceless when he tried to taunt me into charging, how he grumbled and called my warboss names. -sits back and smiles at people when they realize that they have to give up their gun lines to come shift me out of ruins/buildings because with the saves I'm getting I've the numbers to soak up the casualties all game long without blinking an eye. -grins like a demon when my opponent adjusts their plans to either avoid or go after a particular unit, knowing that I placed the unit with the specific intention of getting my opponent to do exactly that, either avoid or go after said unit... I love it when it's a trap either way.\n\nI think that's most of the common ones and some of the things I've done to people to teach them otherwise.Yeah, this one is also common with me. Many people are surprised when they figure they can't bait the tankbustas from their other vehicles using a speeder. Truth is all you need to do is shoot at any vehicle, even if it's out of range and attempt to charge a vehicle. You CAN move away from vehicles in movement phase. Had bout 4 people asking me this. Can't believe I forgot.\n\n1. Gretchin suck. 2. Orks are WAAAY better in close combat than they are at shooting. 3. Orks are AWESOME in close combat. 4. Gotta have a KFF. 5. Looted Wagons with boomguns suck. 6. Battlewagons with killkannons suck. 7. You gotta have a Nob w/PK in EVERY unit that can have one. 8. Orks are not so good versus Mech armies.\n\nMostly this thread has a gaming emphasis, which is cool, as it's the right section for it, but there's also a very large proportion of Non-Ork players that have some pretty massive misconceptions about Ork fluff too (it's also pretty rife with a lot of Ork players as well). I have a thread in the FBH which goes into some of these in larger detail. It can be found here. I'm hoping to update with another article today.\n\nHere's a list of the few big misconceptions that I've already covered:\n\n1. Orks are stupid 2. Ork language is just silly phonetic English 3. Ork skin has to be green 4. Sporing is Ork-centric 5. Not knowing much, if anything, about sporing 6. That subconscious stored knowledge (such as that of a Mek) comprises the entirety of their knowledge and excludes the concepts of practice and learning 7. That \"current\" Ork fluff is modern and retcons much of the rogue trader era (one of the bigger misconceptions) 8. Pretty much everything about Ork Resonance 9. *Ork weapons only work because they think they do* (the biggest misconception) 10. That Orks are the only Orkoids to use resonance 11. That Orks are always funny and silly and thus can't be taken seriously 12. That there are only 6 Clans 13. That you can't have Mono-clan tribes 14. That all Freebootas are pirates 15. Orks cannot be affected by Genestealer infections or Chaos\n\nThere's a few more mentioned in the thread, and I'm not done with the series just yet.\n\nThis one I have found to be largely true. How do you deal with spammed msu transports? I find that i simply never have enough anti-tank to do it. . .--------------------\n\nBashing stuff in the grim future of the 41st millenium since 1999... That's nearly 39000 years of experience !Beakies and guardsmen, with their melta everywhere can do it fine. The problem is with armies that don't have access to enough melta or equivilent anti-tank weaponary. fish'ead have Str10 ap1, that can also do it well. 'Crons have their tricks (just don't be relying on gauss). 'nids find themselves completely hosed on this alone.\n\nQUOTE (Master Mek GuzMek @ Apr 7 2012, 04:51 AM)\n\nIve been told that shootas are no match for bolters\n\nGuzmek\n\nShootas are great.

It's basically a Science Alpha Strike with battle cloak.\n\nIt is also capable of throwing heals to someone in dire need of them to relieve pressure on your friendly Negvar, Recluse or Flight Deck Cruiser since frankly the bop should either have killed, or maimed it's target, or left. Leaving heals unused in the process. Remember RSP is not there to help you sustain a fire fight. It's there to give you a cushion during your Getaway.

{"text": "the Defint class again yesterday. Wanted to have some fast and intense action. Front to enemy, bam, bam, bam, turn around, getting away, heading to enemy again, fire at will, looping...ups, you can't fly any looping?\nThere is an enemy directly above/below me and I have 45degree weapons at front, so twisting myself up or down, I won't get this enemy into my line of fire.\nThen, the ship is really small, all zoomed out, to get an overview, it's hard to see in which direction I fly.\nZooming in, following Camera, it's hard to to see, where the enemy really is.\n\nSo I have a wish: I want to have a first-person-view for my small escort and a kind of 3D-radar.\nI know, this is not Wing Commander, or X or Freespace, but without these features, the Defiant Class (and other small, fast turning escorts) are cut in what's their only strength: turning their weapons quickly towards the enemy. I don't ned to fly a looping with a cruiser, it's to slow in turning.\nPutting 250degree phasers in it, doesn't feel like flying a Definat known from DS9, and even there, they fly loopings.\n\nSo, this is a little...frustrating.\nAt least, from Champions Online I know, the engine allows to go 90degree up and down.\nFirst-person-vew should also be realizable from CO, but it seems to be disabled for STO. Why?\n\nI don't think many would disagree with you, however, we are at the mercy of the devs on this one. This has been discussed often, even in the short time I'm a member.\n\nFingers crossed it's something they are working on long term, though to be honest I don't find it game breaking I can count on one hand the number opf times I've found myself directly under something, generally enemies and other things stay close to the galactic plane. Some schools of thought say that it makes the game more accessible (having a fixed plane of movement), some people just don't get on with space sims for this reason, they get disoriented.\n\nIt has it's plusses and minuses. Perhaps they could make it an option?Thats what made games like Klingon Academy so great.\nYou had a First Person mode, but still had full situational awareness thanks to a number of sensor displays, showing both XYZ axis readings as well as a small image of the target ship as viewed from your locationwell.. that all depends on what the OP meant by \"real 3D\"\n\nif he's talking about full directionalWell, first-person-view would be optional. If you wanted, you can use it. If you want full awareness and can't get it in fpv, you just don't zoom in so far.\n\nI don't think the game physics of IW fits to ST. Have you ever seen a ship looking into another direction as it actually moves? Not in ST. Babylon 5, yes. But not ST.\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by Shingi\n\nwell.. that all depends on what the OP meant by \"real 3D\"\n\nif he's talking about full directionalhope that clears up what i was trying to say there.\n\nI talked about turning.\nSo increasing the pitch beyond 60 degrees or whatever it is.\nAnd even when going over 90degrees, it could be possible to automatically turn the ships top back upside, so don't have any \"inversion\".\nBut I do think, the game engine can't handle this, so in my opinion 89 degree would already better than as it is nowActually, I do not think that is the case for the following reasons:\n\n1) Many times it can be heard impulse being ordered into \"full reverse\". If impulse engines operate on simple thrust, then they must be able to channel almost as much power forwards as backwards which means impulse \"ports\" on the front.\n\n2) I believe it has been stated by those at the top that Impulse engines operate by warping space, similar to warp engines, although not to the degree that they could travel \"faster\" than light.\n\n3) The thrusters clearly operate on thrust and could probably turn a low mass ship like the Defiant very quickly. Indeed, we saw the Enterprise D do a half turn in a matter of about a second (presumably using thrusters). Even if the impulse engines do work like thrusters, that has absolutely no bearing on turn speed. The ship could still do a loop or a barrel roll just as quickly regardless of the forward speed (that is how vector addition works). The only bearing having more thrust in the rear would have is on turn radius at high speeds, but not turn time."}

{"text": "Shield Bearers are still win machines when coupled with a few engineers. I started with them as my bonus ship & have unlocked mark II's. Using full cap of both mark I's & mark II's (24 & 22 respectively) with a full cap of mark II fighters, mark II bombers, full caps of all the free unlock starships & 3 mark I engineers I've yet to lose a ship when assaulting AI worlds. May want to look at reducing the FF radius they project as it's big enough that when one takes enough damage, another ends up covering it while the damaged one gets repaired.\n\nMy old lame tactic of using reclamators (Leech SS and/or Parasites if available) to build up a massive blob of free ships including types I couldn't build myself isn't possible any more due to the changes to the AI Eye & reclamators which is a good thing. AI Eyes in 4.0 used to be a walkover using that tactic as you'd reclaim units so fast you'd be able to just head straight to the AI Eye & kill it using the ships it spawned itself. I haven't got Parasites to play with yet but Leech SS seem to do enough damage to AI units that they are reclaimed with full health however I guess this is balanced in that they only fire one shot at a time.\n\nMRS appears to be quite 'niche' now. May need it's knowledge unlock amount lowered from 4K as I see no reason why I would unlock it when I can unlock mark II & mark III engineers for the same amount of knowledge which are vastly more useful in v5.0 in my opinion.\n\nCore Shield Generators are a great addition from what I can see. I haven't played long enough to get to an AI homeworld but I like how they force your hand with taking certain systems. I didn't particularly like the old mechanic of forcing you to kill all the guard posts in a AI core system before you could take out the AI core as it locked you in to a certain way to tackling the AI homeworlds.\n\nMy first ARS gave me Space Planes. Not sure if I like them or not yet. Also I've just unlocked mark I Riot SS as one of the AI's has Raptors which I keep having to send my Raid SS after since they like to kite. Hopefully the Riot SS will be able to pick them off or at least slow them down so I can kill them easier.\n\nThe AI Eye would counter-blob you, you'd reclaim the AI blob which would trigger the AI Eye to blob you ad infinitum. It was so lame it made the game a walkover as you could practically generate units anywhere in the galaxy.\n\nYou can still farm somewhat with parasites, but not with \"non-stop continuous spawning\" buildings. Also, thanks to the new parasite mechanics (as of 5.001), farming for high level ships is much, much harder (but still possible)."}

Warships are usually exclusively operated by a Navy, though some organisations and companies have operated their own.\n\nBoth the Covenant and the UNSC operate their own fleets of warships. UNSC ships tend to be smaller than their Covenant counterparts, utilising weaponry significantly less advanced than Covenant technology, though making excellent use of coordination and tactical thinking.

In their M4, the Raijin, the Yaki have once again succeeded in creating a ship that is markedly different from others in its class. The Raijin's most dinstinguishing feature lies in its weapons - it is able to mount the BPBE and BPSG weapons, traits shared only by M3 class ships, and few at that. These weapons, albeit with the Raijin's limited weapons generator, mean the Yaki fighter is deadly against all other M4 vessels, and indeed seems to be one of the few ships conceived with the purpose of killing its counterparts in mind. While alone a Raijin would struggle against M3s due to their superior shielding, when attacking en masse the Raijin can be more than a mere annoyance to larger craft, who find them difficult to destroy due to the Yaki ships' high speed."}

{"text": "AI War Base Game\n\nFrom ArcenWikiWhat exactly are the features in the base game of AI War?\n\nA: This topic is something of a moving target, as new features are added all the time in terms of free DLC, etc. This listing is current as of version 3.120 of the game.\n\nPlease bear in mind that this is also not even going to make an attempt to list all of the interface features, all of the facets of the AI, all of the possible activities, etc -- that would be an absolutely gargantuan task, and the rest of the wiki makes that pretty clear. Instead, the idea of this topic is to provide a reference for things like AI types, map styles, ship types, etc, which are easily to enumerate. It thus provides something of a referent point for comparison to expansion additions, for instance, or just serves as a plain old reference if you want to look up certain types of information.\n\nIn all, there are currently 293 different ships in the base game of AI War, not counting things like modular components or control nodes.\n\nBasic Ship Classes\n\nThese four basic ship classes are available to all players (human and AI alike) in literally every game. Almost all of the bonus ship classes are weak against one or more of these basic ship classes. In total there are 18 ships in the basic ship classes.\n\nFighters (I-IV variants)\n\nInexpensive, with a small attack range.\n\nBombers (I-IV and Core variants)\n\nInflicts high damage on heavy defenses. Best ship class for hitting force fields and the final AI command stations.\n\nFrigates (I-IV and Core variants)\n\nFires powerful, long-range missiles, but has a very slow reload time.\n\nScouts (I-IV variants)\n\nCrucial for scouting enemy planets and gathering intel data. Be sure to bring at least one scout with you on every raid, to make sure you can see the full Planetary Summary.\n\nBonus Ship Classes\n\nThe base game of AI War includes 27 \"bonus\" ship classes beyond the base fighter, bomber, frigate, scout quartet (see above) that is in every game. Here is a list of them, along with what makes each one unique. In total there are 117 ships represented between all the bonus ship classes.\n\nBulletproof Fighters (I-IV variants)\n\nStandard fighters upgraded with armor that repels all shell-based fire.\n\nTachyon MicroFighters (I-IV variants)\n\nTiny fighters best in swarms. Reveals any cloaked enemy ships they come near.\n\nRaiders (I-IV and Core variants)\n\nFast ship able to bypass many standard defenses such as mines and tractor beams.\n\nVery long range electrical attack. Protects nearby allied ships by reducing the power of incoming lasers to 1/4 their normal power.\n\nSpace Planes (I-IV and Core variants)\n\nCloaked fighter excellent for bypassing enemy defenses (such as mines and tractor beams), with special onboard radar-dampening equipment that makes it impossible for ships to hit it if they are beyond a certain range from the plane.\n\nEtherJet Tractors (I-IV variants)\n\nBlazing fast cloaked fighter that can grapple an enemy ship and drag it.\n\nForce Field Bearers (I-IV variants)\n\nDoes relatively low damage, but has high health and provides a mini force field to protect allied ships. Its force field does not reduce the attack power of protected ships.\n\nArmor Ships (I-IV and Core variants)\n\nWeak firepower but heavily armored; excellent against most small craft.\n\nAnti-Armor Ships (I-IV variants)\n\nExcellent for attacking enemy armor and other targets at high range.\n\nMLRS (I-IV variants)\n\nMultiple Launcher Rocket System fires multiple mid-power rockets.\n\nMunitions Boosters (I-IV variants)\n\nStrong fighter in its own right, it also gives an attack bonus to nearby ships on your team.\n\nTeleport Raiders (I-IV variants)\n\nFast raiders able to traverse space in an instant.\n\nTeleport Battle Stations (I-IV variants)\n\nTeleporting battle station fires multiple lightning shots.\n\nStarships\n\nStarships are oversized, expensive, powerful vessels for various specialized purposes. Most of them work better on offense, but some of them -- like the Riot Control Starships or Siege Starships or Leech Starships -- can be just as effective on defense. Almost all starships are built at the starship constructor, except for the few that follow special rules (see below). In all, there are 22 different kinds of starships.\n\nScout Starships\n\nNo combat value, but is cloaked, emits tachyon beams, fires counter-sniper flares, and acts as a scout.\n\nMid-strength starship with high firepower. Boosts the strength of nearby ships.\n\nAlien Starships\n\nZenith Starships\n\nAdvanced alien technology makes this a mobile fortress. Very strong against large groups of ships, and boosts the strength of nearby ships.\n\nSpire Starships\n\nA formidable starship using technology based on alien artifacts discovered years ago. Very strong against large groups of ships, and boosts the strength of nearby ships.\n\nCore Starships (AI Only)\n\nThe toughest starship in the game, this relic of the Zenith is a secret controlled only by the AIs. These core starships roam around the core and home planets of the AIs, but tend not to be seen anywhere else.\n\nSiege Starships (I-III variants)\n\nThis is not so much a ship as a gun with engines on it. It is expensive, slow, thinly armored, has a low rate-of-fire, and can't even fire upon most small mobile targets. But its artillery shells can do grievous harm to starships, fortresses, guard posts, guardians, and turrets.\n\nRaid Starships (I-III variants)\n\nSmall, lightning-fast starship with powerful lasers. Excellent for long-range raiding. Can pass/shoot through force fields, and is exceptional at destroying ships with a high armor rating.\n\nLeech Starships (I-III variants)\n\nReclaims enemy ships it kills (reclaimed ships have health = half damage inflicted by reclamator). Very low main attack, but strikes huge numbers of ships at once (marking them for reclamation if any ship kills them).\n\nRiot Starships (I-III variants)\n\nSpecializes in disabling and destroying large numbers of weaker disturbances to the peace. Has three advanced light hardpoints, two medium hardpoints, and two heavy hardpoints.\n\nBomber Starships (I-IV variants)\n\nFast, armored starship that inflicts very high damage on any one target. Great against anything with high health. This is an experimental class of starship that is normally only used by the Mad Bomber AI type. There are also Fabricators around the galaxy that allow the human players to build Mark I Bomber Starships.\n\nDirectly-Constructed Ships\n\nThese different categories of ships represent the different tabs in the command station or mobile builder menus. Rather than being built through a looping queue (as with the military ships and starships noted so far), these ships are directly placed into space and are constructed in-situ. The grand total of these kinds of ships is 83.\n\nEconomic Ships\n\nEconomic ships are, simply used for maintaining and extending your economy, or for doing engineer-type repair/cleanup/rebuilding duties. There are 14 economic ships in all.\n\nEnergy Reactors (I-III variants)\n\nGenerates a moderate amount of energy at a moderate cost-to-benefit ratio. Efficiency goes down by 20/40/80% (by mark level) for each new reactor of this type built on the same planet.\n\nHarvesters (Metal and Crystal variants)\n\nMines crystal or metal found amidst rock deposits or debris fields. Crystal and metal are needed for constructing units.\n\nManufactories (Metal and Crystal variants)\n\nExpensive method for generating crystal or metal by converting one into the other. Useful when access to deposits is limited. Will automatically activate when your supply of one resource runs low, or when storage of one resource is full but the other is not.\n\nScience Labs (I-III variants)\n\nResearch and unlock new technologies. Also gathers up to 3000 knowledge per planet. Mark I and II are mobile but cannot gather from hostile planets. Mark III is immobile but can gather from hostile planets while in supply, which enrages the AI at that planet.\n\nEngineers (I-III variants)\n\nRepairs damaged ships or can accelerate construction done by other ships. Unless issued a specific command by its controller, it will automatically repair nearby allies.\n\nRemains Rebuilders\n\nCleans up exploded ship remains and builds replacement ships in their place. Each ship it rebuilds costs half the normal metal/crystal/time, and it prevents players from having to manually rebuild them. Unless issued a specific command by its controller, it will automatically rebuild nearby remains.\n\nCleanup Drones\n\nRemoves exploded enemy ship remains, to prevent them from being rebuilt by enemy Remains Rebuilders. Also able to dismantle enemy mines on allied planets.\n\nCommand Stations\n\nThere are 18 different kinds of command stations in all.\n\nHome Command Station (Humans)\n\nThe first team to destroy all their opponents' home planet command stations is the winner. If one player controls multiple home planet command stations, destroying one will destroy them all. However, while one player controls multiple home planet command stations, the ship caps of the player will be increased.\n\nEconomic Orbital Command Stations (I-III variants)\n\nEconomic Command Stations have very little defensive quality, and absolutely no ability to attack enemy ships, but they provide the largest income in metal, crystal, and energyLogistical Orbital Command Stations (I-III variants)\n\nLogistical Command Stations provide very little in the way of economic gain, and can't shoot at enemy ships, but they vastly increase the speed of all allied ships and halve the speed of all enemy ships in the current system. They also have middling armor. The highest mark version also stops enemy units from teleporting while they areMilitary Orbital Command Stations (I-III variants)\n\nMilitary Command Stations provide very little in the way of economic gain, but have much more health and the ability to shoot at enemy ships, along with some specialized immunities like the immunity to blade attacks. They also emit tachyon beams (the highest mark version providing planetary tachyon coverage) and an attack boost to all alliesOrbital Command Station - Warp Jammer\n\nCosts significant ongoing resources, but prevents any warps from being initiated against its host planet.\n\nHome Command Station - Core (Humans) (I-III variants)\n\nThis is the core from a destroyed command station. When a player's home planet command station is destroyed, and that player still has surviving allies, this core warps to the allied home planet.\n\nAI Orbital Command Stations (I-III variants)\n\nNerve center of every AI's planetary base. Destroy this to greatly hamper the AI's ability to reinforce itself (although certain other structures, like Special Forces Guard Posts, also need to be destroyed to completely prevent the AI from reinforcing a planet). +15 AI Progress if killed.\n\nCore Command Station (AIs)\n\nAI Home Command Stations cannot be damaged until all of the AI Core Guard Posts on the AI home planet and all of the AI Core Shield Generators in the galaxy have been destroyed. The first team to destroy all their opponents' home planet command stations is the winner. +100 AI Progress if killed.\n\nConstructors\n\nThere are 6 different kinds of constructors that can be directly built, but there are many other types of constructors that are actually under the Capturables section (Advanced Factories, and many types of Fabricators).\n\nSpace Docks\n\nCreates the fighters, bombers, frigates, and other ships that will comprise most of your fleet.\n\nMercenary Space Docks\n\nCreates mercenary ships. Mercenary ships are vastly more expensive than their non-mercenary counterparts, but they have a much larger ship cap.\n\nStarship Constructors\n\nGenerates starships over a long period of time.\n\nMissile Silos\n\nGenerates powerful (and expensive) warheads over a long period of time. Nukes in particular are very dangerous to use, and should only be attempted by advanced players. Detonating any warhead causes the AI Progress to increase by some amount (the amount varies by the warhead).\n\nMobile Builders\n\nAllows you to build economic and defensive ships at planets your team doesn't control. Crucial for establishing beachheads in enemy or neutral territory. Note that ships which require supply will not function outside of supply.\n\nColony Ships\n\nSend to an uninhabited planet to build a new Command Station and capture the planet. Wanting to upgrade an existing command station on a planet? Don't scrap it! Just build the new one and it will replace it without impacting harvesters, reactors, and ownership of the planet.\n\nDefensive Ships\n\nDefensive ships serve a wide variety of purposes, and some of these are even more useful on offense rather than defense - but they all tend to have a support role of some variety, and more often than not are best either used away from the action on enemy planets, or else in the thick of the action on your own planets. There are 21 ships in all in this category.\n\nRally Posts\n\nAllied ships that are sent to this planet will gather at this rally post, which can be moved around at will. If there are multiple allied rally posts on a single planet, entering ships will pick one of them at random.\n\nAdvanced Warp Sensors\n\nProvides better warning of incoming enemy warps to a planet. Wormholes through which a warp will arrive will flash on the minimap, and will turn orange in the main view.\n\nTachyon Drones\n\nWeak, mobile ship reacts with nearby enemy cloaked ships, making them trackable for a short while.\n\nDecloakers\n\nFast mobile ship with moderate attack and the ability to reveal any cloaked enemy ships in a wide arc.\n\nMines\n\nEnemy ships coming too close to these invisible traps will incur heavy damage. The minefield is also damaged, and eventually destroyed, in the process.\n\nMobile Repair Stations\n\nSimultaneously repairs all nearby allied ships. After moving, it must recharge for 60 seconds before it can start doing repairs again: it's best to find a good position for it and leave it there until you're ready to deploy it in a new locale.\n\nTransports\n\nCarries up to 200 units (cannot carry certain very large units). Heavily armored and defensible, this is ideal for slipping past minefields, ion cannons, or high-level enemy planets. If the transport is killed, all of the ships inside are ejected safely just before the explosion. Every wormhole that the transport goes through outside of supply drains its health substantially, but it also regenerates health quickly on a friendly planet. Unloading is instant in friendly territory, but only 10 ships per second in hostile territory. Cannot be scrapped in hostile territory.\n\nFortresses\n\nExtremely large, powerful, and expensive mobile defensive structure. Can store up to 500 units inside itself to protect them during attacks. Also repairs all nearby ships. After moving, it must recharge for 60 seconds before it can start doing repairs again. AI Fortresses are immobile.\n\nForce Field Generators (I-III variants)\n\nCreates a small, mobile force field that provides protection for nearby ships. Ships firing out from under the force field do 75% less damage than normal, so it is best to build defenses around the field.\n\nHarvester Exo-Force Fields\n\nPlace on metal or crystal harvesters to create a tiny shield bubble around them. As long as the exo-shield exists, it will take all damage that would have been dealt to the harvester. Ships that are able to fire through normal force fields can't ignore an exo-shield, as it becomes an extension of the protected ship itself. However, the other effect of having this protection is that the output of the harvester is halved.\n\nTurrets\n\nTurrets are, in general, much more powerful than their mobile counterparts. The downside of turrets is that they are immobile. They are thus very well suited for defense (and sometimes for offense, either in creating a beachhead or otherwise), but typically work best when either augmented with mobile ships or tractor beams / gravitational turrets. There are 33 turrets in all.\n\nBasic Turrets (I-III and Core variants)\n\nInexpensive, basic defense for planetary bases.\n\nFlak Turrets (I-III variants)\n\nFires bursts of hundreds of canisters each in turn containing hundreds of secondary explosives. Blankets an area with light damage that is extremely effective against melee ships but equally ineffective against heavily armored targets and starships.\n\nReacts with nearby enemy cloaked ships, making them trackable for a short while.\n\nHuman-Only Ships\n\nThese ships represent technologies that the human forces have developed after the AIs took over the galaxy -- and so the AI forces do not yet have access to these tools. This can prove very helpful in counterbalancing all of the new tools that the AI has developed (or bought from alien sources) since humanity was pushed to the brink. Of course, humans have the advantage of being able to steal most all of the different types of AI technology in some fashion or another, but the AIs are unable to steal the human technologies. There are 8 different human-only ships, not counting control nodes, which aren't really ships per se.\n\nWarheads\n\nLightning Warheads (I - III variants)\n\nEmits a mid-power explosion of lightning that damages enemy ships in a wide arc on detonation. Can be given a direct target that it will chase and then explode near, or it will explode on death. +1/2/3 AI Progress if killed or scrapped.\n\nArmored Warheads (I - III variants)\n\nArmored version of the standard Lightning Warhead. Almost impossible for enemy ships to destroy, so it is highly likely to reach its target. Emits a powerful explosion of lightning that damages nearby enemy ships on detonation. Can be given a direct target that it will chase and then explode near, or it will explode on death. +10/15/20 AI Progress if killed or scrapped.\n\nEMPs (I - III variants)\n\nDoes a small bit of localized damage and causes a planet-wide electromagnetic pulse when destroyed by enemy forces or by scrapping. Temporarily paralyzes most ships, disables cloaking, and disables force fields and mines on the planet on which it is set off. EMP effects last for 30/70/120 seconds, and affect your ships as well as enemy ships. Does not affect mark V ships or starships. +2/4/6 AI Progress if killed or scrapped.\n\nTachyon Warheads (I - III variants)\n\nDoes a small bit of localized damage and causes a planet-wide tachyon pulse when destroyed by enemy forces or by scrapping. Reveals for 5/8/12 minutes all cloaked ships (enemy and allied alike) on the planet on which it is set off. +1/2/3 AI Progress if killed or scrapped.\n\nNuclear Warheads (I - III variants)\n\nCauses a massive nuclear explosion when destroyed by enemy forces or by scrapping. Destroys all resources and most ships within its area of effect. Does not affect mark V ships or starships. Also causes supply to be permanently lost for all teams within its effective area, meaning you then cannot use science labs, docks, etc. Mark I destroys the planet on which it is detonated. Mark II destroys that planet and any planet connected to it via wormhole. Mark III destroys every planet in the galaxy. +50/500/5000 AI Progress if killed or scrapped.\n\nMercenaries\n\nMercenary Fighters\n\nInexpensive, with a small attack range. Identical to the Fighter Mark IV, except 10x more expensive and with a much larger ship cap.\n\nMercenary Bombers\n\nInflicts high damage on heavy defenses. Best ship class for hitting force fields and the final AI command stations. Identical to the Bomber Mark IV, except 10x more expensive and with a much larger ship cap.\n\nMercenary Frigates\n\nFires powerful, long-range missiles, but has a very slow reload time. Identical to the Missile Frigate Mark IV, except 10x more expensive and with a much larger ship cap.\n\nControl Nodes\n\nThere are currently 23 different types of control nodes, but they are less ships and more behavioral control quasi-interface elements. They are completely invisible and inert as far as the AI is concerned, and only the humans can build them.\n\nCapturables\n\nExcept for the cheats-activated ships, all of these capturables tend to be found scattered around the galaxy, waiting for humans to come make use of them. There is a fair amount to capture in the base game, but one major focus of the first expansion to the game was adding many new capturables. In the base game, there is a total of 15 types of capturables, including the cheats-enabled ones.\n\nGeneral\n\nData Centers\n\nServer farm. Destroy to damage AI Progress by 20.\n\nAdvanced Research Stations\n\nVault of advanced AI technology. Capture to gain a new ship type for your team to build at space docks. Never destroy these, but if it dies sometime after you capture it, you won't lose the technology you gained from it. Can gather knowledge, but not from hostile planets.\n\nAdvanced Factories\n\nCapture to build Mark IV versions of any ship types in which you have already attained Mark III. Never destroy these!\n\nCore(MkV) Fabricators\n\nThere are 9 types of these in the base game, one for each of the Core ship types included in the base game. Capturing these is the only way that human players are ever able to build Core/Mark V ships. Each fabricator only allows you to build a single type of core ship by controlling it.\n\nStarship Fabricators\n\nThere is only one type of these in the base game, allowing you to build Mark IV Bomber Starships.\n\nExperimental Fabricators\n\nThere is only one type of these in the base game, allowing you to build Anti-Starship Arachnids.\n\nCheats-Activated\n\nOmega Drive\n\nThis ship is only available via the \"Activate The Omega\" cheat. It is severely unbalanced and just for fun or testing.\n\nAI-Only Ships\n\nIn the time since the AIs took over the galaxy from the humans, they have been hard at work developing new and stronger technologies as well as buying technologies from aliens the next galaxy over. In many of the ship categories above, from the bonus ship types to the starships to the turrets, there are some ships that are typically only available to the AIs unless the humans capture the technology (and a few of which are technologies that cannot be captured). That pattern holds in this section, but this section lists the more unusual ships -- including special weapons -- that are AI-only (though a number of the weapons in particular can be captured for human use). In all, there are 30 ships in this section, counting the ships that are specific to minor factions (third party AIs).\n\nGuard Posts\n\nMisc AI Ships\n\nAI Force Field Generators (I-III and Core variants)\n\nCreates a force field that provides protection without reducing attack power of ships underneath. Attack with several dozen Mark I Bombers (or better) to destroy.\"\n\nWarp Gates\n\nDestroy these gates to prevent AIs from initiating new warps of raids and reinforcements. Or, is automatically destroyed when the AI's command station is destroyed. The ship production facilities of the AIs are somewhere outside the galaxy -- cut off their ability to warp in raids against adjacent planets by destroying these gates. Note that if all Warp Gates are destroyed, the AI can still bring in ships across normal wormholes, but you won't get a warning.\n\nExo-Galaxy Wormholes\n\nThis one-way wormhole leads to somewhere outside the galaxy. A mysterious force prevents your ships from going through. This wormhole cannot be destroyed, and it will continue letting enemy ships into the galaxy until you finish off both AIs and win the war.\n\nSpecial AI Weapons\n\nAdvanced weapon which insta-kills most ships equal to or lower than its Mark level (and many ships with no Mark level at all). Cannot fire upon ships immune to insta-kill.\n\nAI Troop Accelerators\n\nAdvanced AI technology allows the AI to add reinforcements to this planet at double the normal rate. Destroying this causes the AI Progress to increase by 10.\n\nCounter Spies\n\nAdvanced weapon insta-kills cloaked ships.\n\nSuperFortresses\n\nIncredibly powerful fortress with a massive range. Only bombers and tanks have any chance against it. Immobile. Also repairs all nearby ships.\n\nAvengers\n\nThis ship only comes into play as part of the Avenger AI Plot. A massive, moon-sized space station created by the AI as the final defense against the human onslaught. If the AI Home Command Station to which it is assigned is destroyed, the Avenger will live up to its name.\n\nPlanetary Cloakers\n\nA highly advanced cloaking device. All team ships on the planet which this resides are utterly invisible, even while firing, even if they normally would be visible. They are also immune to tachyon beams and tachyon missiles.\n\nAttrition Emitters\n\nEmits precisely-tuned pulses to drain the health of any enemy ships in the local system.\n\nMinor Faction Ships\n\nRebelling Human Colonies\n\nA formerly captive city filled with living humans. AI progress will skyrocket by 100 if this is destroyed. These civilians have decided to rebel, and have erected a temporary invisibility cloak while they call for aid. When the cloak dissipates, they'll be vulnerable to attacks from the AI, and surely won't last long. When the city is captured by the humans, your entire team can use their facilities to build rebel ships. While you hold the planet on which they are located, their invisibility cloak will remain at full power.\n\nMarauder Buzz Bombs\n\nHostile human vagabonds who live in deep space will occasionally send these automated bombs at human and AI settlements to destroy what they can so that they can escape with the resulting scrap. The buzz bomb fires high-impact grenades that explode on contact with its target, dealing area damage. They won't attack any AI ships that human players must normally manually target.\n\nMarauder Dagger Frigates\n\nHostile human vagabonds who live in deep space will occasionally send these extremely long-range frigates at human and AI settlements to destroy what they can so that they can escape with the resulting scrap. They won't attack any AI ships that human players must normally manually target.\n\nResistance Fighter/Bombers\n\nPockets of human allies who still live in deep space around AI planets will occasionally send these versatile fighter/bomber hybrids to aid you in the fight against the AI at their local planet. They won't attack any AI ships that human players must normally manually target.\n\nResistance Frigates\n\nPockets of human allies who still live in deep space around AI planets will occasionally send these very long-range frigates to aid you in the fight against the AI at their local planet. They won't attack any AI ships that human players must normally manually target.\n\nAI Types\n\nThe following 26 AI types are included in the base game.\n\nEasier\n\nEntrenched Homeworlder\n\nPlanets are heavily defended, and they do moderate attacks on the players.\n\nUnique Units: Captive Human Settlements\n\nFortress Baron\n\nPlanets are mostly moderately defended, but the core planets are incredibly heavily defended, and they do moderate attacks on the players.\n\nUnique Units: SuperFortress\n\nSledge Hammer\n\nWaves slam into one player planet after another, with potentially fatal effect.\n\nTurtle\n\nPlanets are all very-to-incredibly heavily defended, but they do no waves against the players (Cross Planet Attacks and border aggression still happen).\n\nTrain Master\n\nUses many, many astro trains.\n\nExtra Units: Double the normal number of astro trains.\n\nMine Enthusiast\n\nPlanets are all moderately defended, but are heavily booby-trapped with mines.\n\nThe Tank\n\nPlanets are all lightly defended, and they do slightly heavier-than-average attacks on the players.\n\nExtra Units: Has tanks and armor ships from the start, as well as whatever other ships they might unlock.\n\nModerate\n\nVicious Raider\n\nPlanets are all moderately defended, and they do heavy attacks on the players.\n\nExtra Units: Has raider ships from the start, as well as whatever other ships they might unlock.\n\nMad Bomber\n\nNon-core planets are all very lightly defended, but does extremely brutal attacks on the players.\n\nUnique Units: Bomber Starships\n\nFeeding Parasite\n\nUses parasite raids almost exclusively (which can be highly damaging).\n\nExtra Units: Has all parasite ships from the start, as well as whatever other ships they might unlock.\n\nStealth Master\n\nUses stealth raids almost exclusively (which can be highly disconcerting).\n\nExtra Units: Has all ships with cloaking from the start, as well as whatever other ships they might unlock.\n\nCounter Spy\n\nPlanets are heavily defended, and advanced scouting is almost impossible because of the counter spy defenses on each planet, which insta-kill all cloaked ships.\n\nUnique Units: Counter Spy\n\nTeleporter Turtle\n\nPlanets are all very-to-incredibly heavily defended, but they do no waves against the players (Cross Planet Attacks and border aggression still happen). Specializes in teleporting ships, which are particularly powerful in defensive postures.\n\nExtra Units: Has all ships with teleportation from the start, as well as whatever other ships they might unlock.\n\nBackdoor Hacker\n\nPlanets are all moderately defended, and they have a permanent path into each player's home planet (so creating the usual defensive perimeters won't work).\n\nExtra Units: Has a permanent Exo-Galaxy Wormhole on each player's home planet.\n\nAssassin\n\nPlanets are all moderately defended, and they harass the strongest player with prejudice.\n\nBully\n\nPlanets are all moderately defended, and they harass the weakest player with prejudice.\n\nHarder\n\nAttritioner\n\nPlanets are all moderately defended, except that each one has an Attrition Emitter, which drains the health of any human ships in the system. Does heavy attacks on the players.\n\nUnique Units: Attrition Emitter\n\nScorched Earth\n\nHeavily defended planets. Whenever it loses control of a planet, it destroys that planet and all the resources there. Ships will survive.\n\nShadow Master\n\nLike the Stealth Master, except every planet is equipped with a powerful device that keeps all ships permanently cloaked, even when firing, even if they wouldn't normally have cloaking. The only sign of this enemy is the device itself, which can be difficult to reach what with all the invisible enemies firing at you from the nether.\n\nUnique Units: Planetary Cloaker\n\nExtra Units: Has all ships with cloaking from the start, as well as whatever other ships they might unlock.\n\nSpecial Forces Captain\n\nOnly has special forces guard posts -- no regular guard posts. This makes for a tremendous number of ships patrolling around the map at any given time.\n\nTechnologist\n\nTechnologist Homeworlder\n\nLike the Entrenched Homeworlder, except the enemy uses only the highest-technologies right from the start (these are quite a formidable foe).\n\nUnique Units: Captive Human Settlements\n\nTechnologist Raider\n\nLike the Vicious Raider, except the enemy uses only the highest-technologies right from the start (these are quite a formidable foe).\n\nExtra Units: Has raider ships from the start, as well as whatever other ships they might unlock.\n\nTechnologist Sledge\n\nLike the Sledge Hammer, except the enemy uses only the highest-technologies right from the start (these are quite a formidable foe).\n\nTechnologist Turtle\n\nLike the Turtle, except the enemy uses only the highest-technolgies right from the start (these are quite a formidable foe).\n\nTechnologist Parasite\n\nLike the Feeding Parasite, except the enemy uses only the highest-technologies right from the start (these are quite a formidable foe).\n\nExtra Units: Has all parasite ships from the start, as well as whatever other ships they might unlock.\n\nThe Core\n\nPlanets are all lightly defended in terms of the number of ships at each, but all ships of this AI are deadly Mark V/Core ships.\n\nRandoms\n\nNormally when you choose a random AI type you cannot see which type was actually chosen until the game ends. However, there is an AI Modifier in the lobby that allows you to make them visible from the start, but still chosen at random. You can also use the disabledaitypes.txt? file to exclude specific AI types from being chosen (if you've already played them, say, and are trying to work your way at random through the whole list -- or if you simply don't like a specific type of AI).\n\nRandom Easier\n\nChooses one of the easier AI types at random.\n\nRandom Moderate\n\nChooses one of the moderate AI types at random.\n\nRandom Moderate/Easier\n\nChooses one of the easier or moderate AI types at random.\n\nRandom Harder\n\nChooses one of the harder AI types at random (technologist AI types are all considered harder, so this includes them).\n\nRandom Harder Non-Technologist\n\nChooses one of the harder AI types at random, but specifically excluding any of the technologist types.\n\nRandom All\n\nChooses one of AI types at random.\n\nRandom All Non-Technologist\n\nChooses one of AI types at random, but specifically excluding any of the technologist types.\n\nMinor Factions\n\nMinor Factions are a pretty hefty topic, so they are covered in way more depth on the Minor Factions wiki page. Here's a list of the ones added as part of the base game, though:\n\nHuman Resistance Fighters, which occasionally show up to help the player against AI planets.\n\nHuman Marauders, which occasionally show up at player or AI planets during large fights to attack both parties.\n\nHuman Rebelling Colonies, which occasionally call for aid -- rewarding the human players with income and new ships if they answer, or causing an AI Progress increase if the rebel colony perishes.\n\nAI Plots\n\nAI plots can be enabled through the lobby, and provide varied endgame scenarios.\n\nAvenger\n\nAn avenger space station spawns on the death of the core command station of the AI with the avenger plot turned on. The Avenger is incredibly powerful, and will go straight for human home command stations.\n\nMap Styles\n\nThe following map styles are included in the base game:\n\nRealistic\n\nConnections between planets are much more complex, as real wormhole networks would more likely be.\n\nThis mode tends to create more interesting maps, but the visual complexity of them can be intimidating to new players.\n\nRealistic - Hubs\n\nConnections between planets are complex and plentiful.\n\nSimple\n\nConnections between planets are simpler and easier to see.\n\nThis is the recommended mode for new players, but it will result in fewer unique maps.\n\nSimple - Hubs\n\nConnections between planets are simpler and easier to see, but very plentiful.\n\nMusic Tracks\n\nIn all, there is over 50 minutes of music in the base game. The specific tracks are:"}
{"text": "Feb 23, 2012\n\nFirst off I need to apologize for my absence. Between the holidays getting done with and school starting (and getting Modern Warfare 3 for Christmas) I have just been too tired or otherwise engaged to write, which means no blog posts. On the plus side I have gotten in a couple of actual games against an actual opponent (!). Granted, I lost both times but I am getting a better idea of what in my arsenal is effective and what I'm doing wrong, so things are going uphill.\n\nAnyway, I've gone over what the Black Templars' fluff is and how they are portrayed, but a question still remains: \"How do you make a Fluffy Black Templars list?\" Well, we'd have to check the specific unit entries in the codex to see any requirements or limitations on them that aren't applied in the rules, but first let's talk about basic structure.\n\nWe've got two obvious directions at first based on the tactics we are given: Drop Pods and Mechanized. Drop Pods are fairly straightforward, but for Mechanized you could argue between a close combat focus and a more shooty approach. You could also split the Mechanized lists into 'Heavy' and 'Light' depending on whether or not you are using Land Raiders.\n\nOkay, Drop Pod armies (including ones which have more Deepstriking than just the pods) are basically valid fluff-wise with exceptions for specific units which we'll look at later. As for Mechanized, it should basically function as a Space Marine army, but also have a predominant close-range focus. I don't mean you shouldn't take any weapons with a range greater than 12\", I just mean that, in general, your army should excel at Bolter range rather than farther away.\n\nNow then, let's tackle those specific units. Just from memory, I know that some units will be more available in larger forces, which raises an important question: \"Is a list the entire crusade/fighting company, or just one section of a larger battle?\" This is a valid question considering that it determines some crippling inclusions in your list. If you assume that it is the full force, then you need a Marshal, Chaplain, and probably a Techmarine, which aren't very efficient purchases, and taking all three will have lasting consequences for your list. So I'm going to assume that this is not the full army, but just the area that has the greatest importance on the overall outcome or something (think of a justification that you're happy with).\n\nI'll be going over the units as detailed fluff-wise in the codex (not in the order they are given for stats, but before that). Some of these have restrictions but those are almost never specifically stated, so be prepared for a lot of subjectivity to this (as there should be). Also be warned that no vehicles (except Dreadnoughts) are described, and thus I have left out; think of them as supportive elements and less important.\n\nInitiates. They are the backbone, so be sure to take some. :) And yes, most of them should have Bolters, but feel free to take a few armed for close combat. Assault Squads are mentioned here as well, and are basically intended to be your close combat units rather than Crusader Squads. This should be given special attention. In a truly fluffy list you will not have those Powerfist/Meltagun Crusader Squads. The Crusader Squads would be more all-purpose or shooty while the assault contingent is made up mostly by Assault Marines.\n\nNeophytes. You can have a few, but the codex isn't very clear on how much of the force are Neophytes. Only about a dozen per year are enlisted, so keep in mind that they are probably rare.\n\nSword Brethren. Once again, not many clues as to how many compared to Initiates, but assume not a whole lot. Terminators are included here, and remember that they are technically taken for their Powerfists, not their guns.\n\nThe High Marshal. Okay, one special character out of about 5,000 guys who are spread out over the entire Imperium. Just how important is your little 'battle'? Not a single significant threat to the Imperium? Yeah, he's probably not there.\n\nMarshals and Castellans. Not much requirements here aside from a general (and loose) rule of thumb that bigger armies should have Marshals while smaller ones should take Castellans. However, there I the one caveat that Marshals leads Crusades, Castellans lead Fighting Companies, so select accordingly. For example, I have a fighting company (plans on that sometime in the future) and so I should use a Castellan; Marshal Learoth has a Crusade and so can either use a Marshal or a Castellan (since the Castellan could be leading a single fighting company of the Crusade).\n\nThe Emperor's Champion. Yes.\n\nTechmarines. Not much to limit them, but you should probably keep it down to one of them, maybe two in a large force. They're technically supposed to basically be Initiates but with a strong loyalty to the Machine, so there really isn't much of a connection between how many vehicles you have and how many Techmarines you should have.\n\nDreadnoughts. Similar to the High Marshal in that they are really only brought out when they are needed, so this is situational but if you can think of cause to take them feel free because their numbers are already limited to three with no more than a single Venerable.\n\nApothecaries. At your leisure, but neither required nor restricted.\n\nChaplains. Kind of like Commanders, they're available. Nothing mentioned about Reclusiarch vs. Master of Sanctity, so choose at your own discretion (once again, however, size could affect this).\n\nLand Raider Crusader. If you're tackling (or going to tackle) enemy fortifications (or if you're fighting in a city, or something), then these become available. But they have a role that they play and it is not for every battle.\n\nGrimaldus. There's really not much I can say about him. He's almost like any chaplain you might invent, except he probably isn't in your army. I suppose there really isn't anything keeping you from taking him aside from the point limit in the codex though.\n\nSo when we've taken all of this, what would a fluffy list look like? Well, it could probably look a whole lot like pretty much any competitive Black Templars list out there, with PotMS and some Gunlines being potential exceptions because of their focus on longer ranges. But something such as my 'Best of Black Templars' list? Which is mostly intended to get 12-24\" away from the enemy? Yes, that fits all of the parameters rather nicely. Mechanized column, Land Speeders shielding the outskirts, close-range; except for the Dreadnoughts (which can be explained, though every battle could be challenging) and the standard size for the Crusader Squads (which is excusable), it's a fluffy list.\n\nHowever, to be fair a better example of a fluffy list would be Algesan's Deepstrike list. It's got everything and probably uses Terminators in their most accurate role, free use of Powerfists plus providing an important service in firepower.\n\nI hope that this entire series has been both helpful and interesting but until I get (or am given) another idea, this pretty much wraps up my posts about Black Templars Fluff (though you might be able to expect a few to come out a while after the new Codex). I've looked at it, analyzed it, and talked about applying it on the table. Not a whole lot left to do (I suppose I could find something to do with the Crusades, but that feels forced without having an actual idea of what to do). I've got some plans for what's coming up and I pretty much just need to finish a single Vassal game to get the next post almost entirely done."}
{"text": "n girls, i was just wondering what the general opinion about the science power Photonic Fleet is. II find it to be very handy. You make a bunch of fake ships to distract your attackers. From a role-playing perspective you're simply confusing your foes sensors to make it seem like they're being attacked by multiple ships. It's saved my life more then once.\n\nIf I'm to understand correctly, Photonic Fleet is actually a result of combining the holographic emitters that now line almost every corrider of starships now, and the sensor arrays of the ship. In essence, turning the exterior of the ship into one big holo-emitter. It's not that you're confusing enemy ships; they're still taking damage when the photonic ships fire on them. They're very \"real\" holograms, but with the safety's off. And a phaser beam is still nothing but particles of light and heat, so rather easy for even a \"fake\" phaser to be very deadly, lol.\n\nI like Cosmic_One's explanation. I have to admit, I've always found the idea of sentient holograms kinda stupid. (Red Dwarf'sd Rimmer is the only one I can take with a grain of salt) Why bother building ships when you can just send a fleet of holograms?\n\nLike most hologram stuff in ST, it's quite silly when you think about it (phasers I can almost understand, but how do holographic torpedoes work?) but its a useful skill. They do decent enough damage, especially if you're lucky enough to summon multiple escorts.\n\nIHah, that's my problem with this ability as well.\n\nMatter of taste, obviously. Some people really love it, but I rarely use it as it just \"feels wrong\"."}
{"text": "Also, looking at the comparitive prices just made me realize something pretty awesome: the credits you earn will actually mean something beyond just advancing the game. Think about it. Yeah, a standard Raven is kitted out as a better scout, but it also costs 2 million more than a standard Cicada. That same two million could go a long way towards letting that standard Cicada kit out for wider variety of fighting. BasicallyFudge. Just talking about this dumb little Cicada makes me want this go to open beta more than anything else yetOur long term campaigns and story played nearly like the mech commander games. Take missions for pay, repair or abandon equipment when things were bad, hunt down and murder people who were behind on payments.The devs have stated that you wont be able to add JJs to mechs/variants that don't support them (I assume you'll be able to remove them from mechs that do have them, tho I can't imagine why anyone would). And the only Cicada variant that has JJs uses level 2 tech that isn't for sure in the game yetAssuming they'll be anything like CBT, without CASE systems being in game I'd imagine most ammo explosions will be instantly lethal, unless the ammo bin was low on munitions already. The one thing I'd like to see changed from CBT is machine gun ammo explosions, which should not do infinity damage like they tend to doWith regards to ammo explosions, one can only hope that machine gun ammo doesn't act as a perfectly contained nuclear bomb when it goes offWell, you could manipulate the number of heat sinks, the amount and positioning of the armor, and the engine power, which was cool.\n\nNot that any of that mattered, since most servers had heat disabled, everyone maximized armor, and no one touched their engine ratings.\n\nI guess sometimes people would strip all their electronic equipment off to load more weapons on their mechs, but that was really the only meaningful choice to be made somethingBeing able to add jump jets to a Daishi was one of the dumbest things in ME3's customization.\n\nThere is a canonical Daishi/Dire Wolf configuration with jump jets, the S configuration. Like all the S configs, it's designed for close-quarters (primarily urban) combat. It has an LB-20X autocannon, a large pulse laser, five medium pulse lasers, two Streak SRM-4's, two machine guns and two anti-personnel podsThat was my point. Pick-up games and scenarios were far more common, and that's how the vast majority of people played the tabletop game. Thus, games which replicated the scenario style or skirmish style play would be more true to tabletop play in general. You certainly wouldn't go to a con and play an ongoing campaign (except for a couple years, when they attempted a \"Living Battletech\" style of campaign that didn't progress very well). It was difficult to even find C-Bill costs for 'Mech parts until the Compendium rolled around. You had to make that shit up back in the day, certainly in the era of the early MechWarrior games compared to the tabletop rulesThe only tabletop BT game I ever played was a mercenary campaign. It was pretty decent, if a bit slow-moving at times.\n\nAs for the computer games, I've always loved the mercenary-focused installments best. There's just something about the resource management aspect of it that really clicks for me. It imbues the action with another layer of importance and urgency.\n\nOn the subject of resource management and economics, I wonder if they'll do anything with C-bill cost as a balancing mechanism for MWO. I'm sure an Atlas will cost more to buy and repair than a Jenner, but that's not relevant during the match, and anyway I doubt they'll make an Atlas cripplingly expensive to operate. (See World of Tanks for an example of this phenomenon in action; an IS-7 may cost 6 million credits but once you've bought it you can basically fight Tiger IIs with it all day.) I suppose they'll probably just stick with tonnage as the only limit on what you can bring, for better of for worse.\n\nSome day, though, I'd like to see a game of this type give players a reason to care about cost efficiency vs. combat potency. (After all, the Russians won WWII by producing a shitload of T-34s quickly and cheaply, even if they weren't individually as good as the Panther.) It'd be kind of cool if teams had a limited C-bill budget instead of, or even in addition to, a simple tonnage limit.\n\nI'm hoping the combat matchup system works something like WoT, except without being completely screwed up (or at least it was back when I played it). So for something like 4v4, a random team could have, say, a light, a couple medium/heavies, and an assault or 2 medium, 2 heavies against a similar spread, but you wouldn't have stuff like 4 Atlases getting matched up against some Jenners. WoT had some pretty messed up matches, though, because the matchups didn't seem to pay much attention to tanks besides size so you could have horrible matchups despite overall weight being about the sameYeah, I know they've had games with salvage/C-bill systems, but that's all pretty short-term stuff meant for singleplayer. Getting more money was an objective, but wasn't so tough as to make spending the money all that meaningful. If it takes, say, a week's play in the MMO to earn a million C-bills, then buying new mechs and equipment is going to mean a lot more than running a couple of missions to make some quick cash and buy a new mech. Even on the low end of things with an Urbanmech, that's over a week to buy one dinky little mech. You just get attached more to a mech if you have to stick with it for a while. If it sucks, you'll think back that crappy whatever you had; if it's great, you'll have second thoughts about giving it up and trading it in.\n\nMaking people have that sort of long-term attachment makes all the difference in the world between people just playing a mech versus making them feel like they own the mech. And when the idea is to get people to like their mech enough that they'll buy stuff for it in an otherwise-free MMO, attachment is definitely good.\n\nI'm hoping the combat matchup system works something like WoT, except without being completely screwed up (or at least it was back when I played it).\n\nAllow me to reassure you that it is still absolutely jacked.\n\nDoesn't stop the developers from posting a \"What do you think of the matchmaking system? We want honest, thoughtful, polite feedback\" thread on the official forums every single patch, then ignoring it when everybody says \"Kindly fix the fucking matchmaking.\"\n\nIt's armor is about what you'd expect from a 40 tonner, nothing special. It can run 129.6 kph, which is somewhat unusual for its size (most 40s go 97.2 kph).\n\nEDIT: Seems to be the fastest, most lightly-armed mediums in this timeframe that doesn't use high-tech gear. Just a big fuckin engine on legs.\n\nEDIT EDIT: Also note, the weapons are all in it's torso. Those arms are just shields.\n\nThat seems like my kind of scouting mech. But then again, the weapons don't really scream \"put some pressure on to make a getaway.\" Maybe there's tanks and turrets and shit that this mech can swoop in and take out, rather than being mech-to-mech combat based.\n\nThere's also the option of shutting your mech down to take you off the radar, giving you the potential for a surprise attack.\n\nExcept for the part where you're a big-ass mech and anybody with half a brain cell can respond to the radar blip from activating near them long before you could do anything meaningful. At least, every Mechwarrior game I've played has done things that way. Startup ends up taking so long that you end up chewing on lasers before you can fire, thus sort of negating the whole idea of a \"surprise attack\".\n\nNot to mention the problem of trying to hide a mech forty feet tall on maps designed to prevent mechs from being obscured by terrain or objects. Can't blame the engineers too much for that; they were told to build a walking tank, not the galactic champion of giant robot hide-and-seek."}
{"text": "Modules\nModules are enhancements that may be added to ships that are at least size 1. These increase the cost of the craft they are applied to and provide a wide array of bonuses and effects, thgouh colony and space station construction are linked to modules. You may replace and/or add modules like any other system while the craft is at a friendly world or station. A ship may have a total size of modules equal to its own size (so a size 4 ship can carry up to size 4 worth of modules).\n\nThis lab provides the ship with advanced sensors dedicated to navigation, this provides a few bonuses. When the ship spends 0.2 turn scanning a jump gate or wormhole, the chances of a jump miscalculation occurring are greatly reduced. When warping, the ship can retain up to 1/2 (rounded down) of its sensor value to observe its surroundings during warp (allowing the craft to possibly drop out of warp to investigate strange readings). The ship reduces any damage sustained by warping through rifts by 1.\n\nThis module provides storage for resources, wreckage, etc. Cargo modules can carry a total amount of resources/wreckage of a value equal to twice their size. These may also be required to carry artifacts, especially if they are large.\n\nThis allows the construction of a new colony on an open world. To construct the colony you must deploy the module there at the start of a turn. It takes 1 full turn to construct the colony. When a colony finishes, you now control that world. It begins with 1 construction value and 2 energy, and begins receiving infrastructure on the following turn. If you used the size 1 module, the craft carrying the module is consumed in the process. If you used the size 2 module, only the module is consumed to create the colony.\n\nThis module contains additional troops and equipment for defense and boarding operations. The equipped craft increases its boarding strength by an amount equal to the size of this module. Note that this boarding strength is added to the size of the craft to determine the base boarding strength (making the craft more difficult to capture, and better at capturing other craft despite taking loses).\n\nDrones are remote controlled fighters, or mindless swarms. They are smaller than normal size 0 craft, attacking as a group to inflict damage, though such craft are difficult to evade. Treat the drone module as a weapon with strength equal to twice the total module size. This weapon attacks independently of the craft's primary weapons (if any), they cannot attack in pass 1, but may attack in any other pass. The drones have an attack range of 6 units (note that this range is due to the fact the craft can move and strike swiftly), and ignore all DR bonus from the target's engines and also do not suffer the normal loss of damage when splitting it between multiple targets. If you have attacked with them at least once in a wave, they may be targeted as though they were a ship. Damage assigned to them damages their attack strength by an equal amount (note this must be repaired before it is returned to full strength). Your foes must declare the drones as their intended target before the wave begins.\n\nDrones take 1 less damage from all attacks due to their small size and quick movements.\n\nWhen you assign a drone control module, you select a ship weapon type you have ranks in to be the damage type the module uses. You may assign a single weapon trait to the module/size (based on the weapon type you applied), adjusting the cost as normal. Drones equipped with the long-range trait have a range of 8 units.\n\nThis module allows the craft to carry other smaller craft onboard. Note that craft loaded in a hangar cannot have their own hangars loaded. A hangar module can carry a total size of craft equal to its own size -1. Note that each size step down doubles the number of craft can fit in that space (for example; if you have a size 2 hangar bay, you can load a size 1 craft or 2 size 0 craft. Whereas a size 4 hangar bay can carry a size 3, two size 2's, 4 size 1's or up to 8 size 0's, or any similar combination of those sizes). A size 1 hangar module can only carry a single size 0 craft.\n\nThese modules allow the gathering of ore from asteroid fields. They collect ore at a rate equal to the module's size each turn. If applied to a ship, the resources must be stored in a supply module to be returned for resources (either from the mining craft or a cargo ship in its fleet). If applied to a station in an asteroid field, the resources are gathered automatically, as though the station were simply a planet.\n\nThis module provides small weapons that are used to deter and destroy small ships. When the equipped ship is attacked by a size 0 craft or drones, the attacker takes damage from the module equal to the module's size. The module has a range of 6 units, if the attacker is firing from beyond that range, it will not take damage. This counter-attack occurs each time the equipped craft is attacked.\n\nPoint Defense attacks ignore the damage reduction from engines and the damage reduction drones have passively for their size.\n\nWhen you equip this module, choose a ship weapon type you have at level 2, this module's attacks use that same type for its damage. Note that you can only apply one weapon trait to this module, regardless of size.\n\nThese modules allow craft to make in-flight repairs to themselves or other ships/stations/orbital defenses. The production value for the repair rate is equal to twice the size of the module. Note that you must have stored resources or wreckage within the fleet to make the repairs.\n\nThis module provides a lab capable of advanced research and analysis. The ship may spend an extra 0.2 turn scanning worlds or ships to treat its sensors as though they were 2 ranks higher. In addition, the crew reduces the time it takes to translate alien languages by 0.5 turn and may reverse engineer alien technology. Reversed technology is of course only available to the crew until it returns to a friendly world or station, at which point it can unload the information to local scientists.\n\nWhen being built, this module has ship systems assigned to it, other than warp and engines. All costs are treated as if assigning them to a size 1 ship. You must assign at least 1 rank of hull to the module. Traits may also be assigned to the module. When this module is unloaded, it is used to create a space station in that hex that possesses all of the tech/traits used in the module. This takes 1 full turn.\n\nStations are a cross between planets and ships. They begin with 4 base energy, 1 construction value, 6 infrastructure and a starting infrastructure cap of 10 (and a max cap of 15). At the start of the turn, you treat it like a world, building certain structures on it and/or building defenses. Stations are limited to building industry structures. Stations are considered planets for the use of economics and logistics. Once a station has a shipyard it may build more modules for itself. It is treated as a size 4 ship in terms of what it can equip.\n\nStations receive the bonus hull value for being a size 4 craft.\n\nYou may add another station module to an existing station, though expanding a station in this way treats the station as two stations against your control limit (3 for 3, etc). Adding another station module increases the station's maximum infrastructure cap by another 15 and its overall size by another 4 (increasing hull, boarding strength and available space for additional modules).\n\nStations are repaired like ships, but may repair themselves so long as they have either a repair module (with sufficient resources) or a shipyard.\n\nWeapon Battery\n\nSize 1+ Module\nCost Modifier: +1/size based on weapon type\nRequirement: Ship or Defense Weapons (Any type), can only be assigned to craft of size 4+\n\nThis module provides additional fire support, increasing the weapon damage of one of your weapon systems by 1/size.\n\nNote that the following modules may be equipped to defenses of proper size; Reinforced Hull, Reinforced Shields and Weapon Battery.\n\nColonizing New worlds\nYou may begin new colonies using the colony modules (see the 'colony module' listed above for details on colonization). Note that your first colony module is at a reduced cost due to the preparations your race has been making towards settling on new worlds. The number of worlds your race can control is limited by your development aspects (note that your homeworld is never counted against this limit);\n\nWorld Control Limit: 1 + Level of Economics + Level of Industry + Level of Logistics"}
{"text": "The Occupation Planet's Defenses Are Too Weak\n\nNR2001\n\nThe defenses are just too weak. After you get a huge fleet, you can jump in, and go all 'lalala' on the planet.\n\nAlso, the starbase is not upgraded. I was expecting a fully upgraded starbase. If the dev's could find a way to give the starbase upgrades without the occupation people actually playing, that would be great. I know that this may take a while to put in the code, but it is too easy to kill the starbase. If the dev's can't find a way for the starbase to spawn upgraded, then could they possibly make another starbase entity that was as good as an upgraded starbase?\n\nBTW, I think the starbase should have ALL of the upgrades possible, not just 8. I mean, it's the occupation planet we're talking about. It's some ancient planet with relics of power that can assure supremacy. Surely they would want to defend it heavily, right? It's their super special artifact, right?Yes and no, its already hard to measure how much of a fleet you need to actually take the occupational planet. The main problem is that, it is implied that you macro up and army, on maps with very few aggressive paths towards your enemy. And you take the occupational planet and contest it with the enemy. Adding to the defense would make it a pain in the ass to actually take this planet and thats where the problem comes in.Or they could make it so that the natural orky counts as a ship of some sort so that you could make another starbase in the gravity well and have double the protection. That would be easier to program than letting you upgrade the starbase you capture since the game files do not naturally allow you to do thatQuoting Teun-A-Roonius, reply 14 QuVery good idea.

{"text": "Sunday, January 20, 2013\n\nGanking 101: Scouting\n\nYou've probably heard it said among our gank fleet members that the scouts are the most important members of the fleet, aside from the fleet commander (and even then it's arguable). All true. Our scouts play several roles at the same time. They're more like spies, really: Stealthy, sometimes invisible, sometimes in disguise, gathering intelligence, and oh-so-innocent behind their positive sec status.\n\nOur scouts may not carry weapons, but they are deadly. Our enemies learn their names quickly, and they immediately tense upon seeing one enter local. But how does a New Order scout operate? This post will offer some basic lessons.\n\nFirst thing's first. A simple Ship Scanner I allows you to peer into the tank of any potential target. It has no skill prerequisites. If you fit a Passive Targeter I (requires Targeting I to be trained), your prey will not know he's being locked and scanned. Simply activate the Passive Targeter and click on a mining ship. Though the glow of the module activation will not last long, you're in the clear. You can repeatedly scan the ship without its knowledge.\n\nAnd you must scan the miner repeatedly, because each time you do, you get only partial results. You used to get doubled results, but no more. Simply note each tank module and run another scan to see if there are more. You should do at least 5 scans. Each one takes a second. Your fleet commander will determine if the target is too tanked. Tell him about shield and armor modules. You can ignore shield boosters and EM or Explosive hardeners, since they'll have no effect on what we do.\n\nTo find targets, you can go to the nearest ice field, or use your directional scanner to find stuff in the asteroid belts. The simplest way is to scan a cluster of distant asteroid belts and then find out which one the target is in by warping to one and scanning the rest. Don't get too hung up on the targets; focus on the belts. Targets themselves may be stored in a POS where you can't get to them.\n\nIf you're cloaked in a Covert Ops or Stealth Bomber, maneuver your ship to find a clear path between you and the target, so nothing will decloak you when you approach. Anything can decloak you, including asteroids, cans, wrecks, and drones. The decloak range is 2,000m. Setting \"Keep at Range\" at 5,000m will enable your ship to breeze at top speed toward the target...\n\n...and you'll automatically slow down quickly enough to not be decloaked, even by orbiting drones. At 5,000m, you're too far to provide a proper warp-in for the fleet. You'll want to be right next to the target just before the fleet initiates its final warp to you. It takes around 15 seconds to go from 5,000m to being directly atop the target. If the fleet HQ is in the same system, hit \"Approach\" when they undock. If they're in the next system, begin the approach at the FC's signal. If you're an FC, a good signal time is when you start dropping out of warp on the other side of the final gate. By the time you exit warp, jump through the gate, and get ready to do the fleet warp, the scout should be in position.\n\nIMPORTANT\n\nA cloaked ship is not necessary for scouting. Sometimes it doesn't even help that much, because they often get decloaked in the busy ice field, or they drop cloak to run the Ship Scanner. Yet our scouts are notorious, and they get camped by people who want to interfere with the ganks. Scouts should always report to the FC whenever any combat ships are in the belt. A good scout is one who knows how to frustrate the campers. Here's how.\n\nFirst, a scout should hit different systems, rather than the same system over and over. A scout should check asteroid belts, as these generally aren't (or can't be) camped. Leaving campers in a belt all day while you strike elsewhere leaves them feeling useless.\n\nBut if you want to hit a popular ice field despite the campers, there's a useful technique: Bookmarking targets.\n\nAny ship can fly right up to a target and create a bookmark. Enter the target's name as the bookmark and then leave. It's now possible for a fleet to warp to the target without having a scout in person to provide the warp-in. And without a scout, the campers have no one to camp. They'll have no idea where the next attack will come.\n\nAfter collecting a target bookmark or two, the scout returns to the HQ station, copies the target bookmark into the inventory, and trades it to the FC. If the aggression period isn't up, the scout can continue looking for targets.\n\nOnce the FC has the target bookmark in his or her own People & Places, the target(s) may be hit at any time. Using this method, a scout can even set up warp-ins in multiple systems at once, further frustrating campers who don't know which system is next in line for attack.

{"text": "Sunday, January 20, 2013\n\nGanking 101: Scouting\n\nYou've probably heard it said among our gank fleet members that the scouts are the most important members of the fleet, aside from the fleet commander (and even then it's arguable). All true. Our scouts play several roles at the same time. They're more like spies, really: Stealthy, sometimes invisible, sometimes in disguise, gathering intelligence, and oh-so-innocent behind their positive sec status.\n\nOur scouts may not carry weapons, but they are deadly. Our enemies learn their names quickly, and they immediately tense upon seeing one enter local. But how does a New Order scout operate? This post will offer some basic lessons.\n\nFirst thing's first. A simple Ship Scanner I allows you to peer into the tank of any potential target. It has no skill prerequisites. If you fit a Passive Targeter I (requires Targeting I to be trained), your prey will not know he's being locked and scanned. Simply activate the Passive Targeter and click on a mining ship. Though the glow of the module activation will not last long, you're in the clear. You can repeatedly scan the ship without its knowledge.\n\nAnd you must scan the miner repeatedly, because each time you do, you get only partial results. You used to get doubled results, but no more. Simply note each tank module and run another scan to see if there are more. You should do at least 5 scans. Each one takes a second. Your fleet commander will determine if the target is too tanked. Tell him about shield and armor modules. You can ignore shield boosters and EM or Explosive hardeners, since they'll have no effect on what we do.\n\nTo find targets, you can go to the nearest ice field, or use your directional scanner to find stuff in the asteroid belts. The simplest way is to scan a cluster of distant asteroid belts and then find out which one the target is in by warping to one and scanning the rest. Don't get too hung up on the targets; focus on the belts. Targets themselves may be stored in a POS where you can't get to them.\n\nIf you're cloaked in a Covert Ops or Stealth Bomber, maneuver your ship to find a clear path between you and the target, so nothing will decloak you when you approach. Anything can decloak you, including asteroids, cans, wrecks, and drones. The decloak range is 2,000m. Setting \"Keep at Range\" at 5,000m will enable your ship to breeze at top speed toward the target...\n\n...and you'll automatically slow down quickly enough to not be decloaked, even by orbiting drones. At 5,000m, you're too far to provide a proper warp-in for the fleet. You'll want to be right next to the target just before the fleet initiates its final warp to you. It takes around 15 seconds to go from 5,000m to being directly atop the target. If the fleet HQ is in the same system, hit \"Approach\" when they undock. If they're in the next system, begin the approach at the FC's signal. If you're an FC, a good signal time is when you start dropping out of warp on the other side of the final gate. By the time you exit warp, jump through the gate, and get ready to do the fleet warp, the scout should be in position.\n\nIMPORTANT\n\nA cloaked ship is not necessary for scouting. Sometimes it doesn't even help that much, because they often get decloaked in the busy ice field, or they drop cloak to run the Ship Scanner. Yet our scouts are notorious, and they get camped by people who want to interfere with the ganks. Scouts should always report to the FC whenever any combat ships are in the belt. A good scout is one who knows how to frustrate the campers. Here's how.\n\nFirst, a scout should hit different systems, rather than the same system over and over. A scout should check asteroid belts, as these generally aren't (or can't be) camped. Leaving campers in a belt all day while you strike elsewhere leaves them feeling useless.\n\nBut if you want to hit a popular ice field despite the campers, there's a useful technique: Bookmarking targets.\n\nAny ship can fly right up to a target and create a bookmark. Enter the target's name as the bookmark and then leave. It's now possible for a fleet to warp to the target without having a scout in person to provide the warp-in. And without a scout, the campers have no one to camp. They'll have no idea where the next attack will come.\n\nAfter collecting a target bookmark or two, the scout returns to the HQ station, copies the target bookmark into the inventory, and trades it to the FC. If the aggression period isn't up, the scout can continue looking for targets.\n\nOnce the FC has the target bookmark in his or her own People & Places, the target(s) may be hit at any time. Using this method, a scout can even set up warp-ins in multiple systems at once, further frustrating campers who don't know which system is next in line for attack. This is also efficient because a scout can look for more targets, rather than sitting next to just one while waiting for it to be attacked.\n\n\"But what if the bookmarked target leaves in the meantime?\" you ask. After giving the FC the bookmarks, the scout returns (preferably cloaked, but not necessarily) to keep watch from a distance. If the miner has not left, the bookmark warp-in is still good. In a busy ice field, a scout can even sit next to a second target on the other end of the belt. If campers follow him, the scout tells the FC to hit the bookmarked target. If the campers don't follow him, the scout tells the FC to warp to him and hit the target he's sitting on. Either way, the campers lose and the gankers win.\n\nIn some cases, I've seen miners return to the same position over and over throughout the day, because they've got their mining position bookmarked.

{"text": "Obviously I get more metal for my energy when I keep the overdrive rate at a constant. Not when energy storage is kept at same levels.\n\nThe idea is to use surplus of energy for overdrive, not all.\n\nAnd you get more metal the more energy is used by overdrive.\n\nCmon... Of course you dont overdrive energy you need, I'm not stupid. But if you overdrive same amount of energy at a constant rate or variably according to storage... Naturally it is better to get the best rate available, if you can plan your economy for that.\n\nQuote:\n\nAnd if Im m stalling it would make sense to not keep unused energy stored for nothing.\n\nIf you stall m you automatically aren't used all your e -> more e available for overdrive. And you probably want to have a reserve for all the things that need e: weapons, d-gun, reclaim etc.[/quote] Maybe I want but at other times i dont. How does the game know what i want...\n\nAfter osme playtesting it kinda seemes like the the amounts of metal mined have been increased somehow. Ive checked the source and the overdrive equation is the same though. Maybe it felt that just because people porced more because they wanted to play with pylons, dunno.\n\nAnyway, I loved this new featue on paper, and at the moment i cant say there are any real issues making it bad, other than forcing people to do a few more clicks. The problem is that CA gameplay doesnt focus on territory control, with most of the economy concentrated in the main base and only defenses and mexes being located outside. After the first few minutes when the borders are decided, the combat revolves mostly about controlling the wreckfields and reclaiming, not controlling the mexes. And the games with few players on large open maps usually dont go beyond basic overdrive level as well, so i cant think of a setup where controlling and maintaining your energy grid and raiding the enemy one would be really important. And since bases are usually concentrated in small spaces, i dont think making factories depend on energy grids would do anything other than force players to do more clicks.\n\nPlus i still dont fully understand how exactly the system works, here's an example, please explain how energy wiill be distributed in the following setup: fusion and 1 mex unconnected to any grids.\n\nThe amount of energy available to a local grid through local energy sources is only used to calculate the maximum amount of energy that can be spent on overdrive for the local metal extractors.\n\nThat is, your 1mex3fus vs 3mex1fus? If the total free energy (due to spending on construction and units) is less than 1/3(fusions) * fusionE * 4(mexes), then the same amount of energy is spent on all of the overdriven mexes. If the total free energy is greater than 1/3 * fusionE * 4, then the 3 mexes located in the 1fus network will hit their cap (1/3 of a fus) and the remaining free E will go to the 4th overdriven mex (the one that has 3 fus on it and thus has an overdrive-cap of 3*FusionE.\n\nAnd of course, the mex outside the grid gets no overdrive, and the fusion outside of the grid can't contribute to the overdrive-cap.\n\nBasically, think of the energy-sources on the network as the energy that is *available* to use for overdrive on the local metal extractors... the energy will still be allocated in the most optimal way, but that availability provides a local upper-limitQuote:\n\nQuote:\n\nIf you stall m you automatically aren't used all your e -> more e available for overdrive. And you probably want to have a reserve for all the things that need e: weapons, d-gun, reclaim etc.\n\nMaybe I want but at other times i dont. How does the game know what i want... mex unconnected to any grids.\n\nFirstly the sum of squared mex output is used to determine the most efficient way to overdrive, I think Evil4Zerggin did the calculus a while ago. Only the overdriven mexes contribute to the sum.\n\nMex squared sum = (10^2 )*4 = 400\n\nexcess energy = 3 fusions - 150 = 150 (Note: I misread and only saw 3 fusions, I cannot be bothered recalculating it all, the only thing the 4th fusion would do is add another 100 to excess energy)\n\neach grid is then looped through. Lets say the 1 mex + 2 fusion is first.\n\nLoop through the mexes in the second grid. ( mexE = excess energy*(metal^2) / Mex squared sum = 150*100/400 = 37.5 energy Overdrive = -1+(1+(37.5*0.2))^0.5 = 1.92 extra metal = 19.1 ) x 3 on the third loop the grid notices that it is trying to spend 112.5 energy (37.5*3) on the mexes in the grid when it only has 100 energy connected. All the previously calculated extra metal does not count towards the overdrive output as the efficiency is wrong (except previously maxed grids as they are unaffected).\n\nI don't think most people can easily grasp the efficiency rates of overdriven mexes. Though the pylon system itself (e available to overdrive any one mex is capped to a max of whatever is connected to it via the grid) is pretty clear.\n\nI really, really agree with Yogs point here. The game is already quite reclaim heavy, and by centralising the economy and re-emphasising mex control, we make it even more reclaim heavy. I dont have so much of a problem with slightly more centralized econ (less landgrab) but on the whole, putting overdrive beyind a pylon means we've lost a lot of metal from non-reclaim sourcesThis is ridiculous. I dont need to have constant e production nor e spending, to keep overdrive rate constant. And it doesnt mean I'd necessarily excess e either.\n\nNo you don't need to. But it's harder and you'll have to stop spending e on other things once e spending increases (and it will) or e production changes. Having a constant overdrive rate is not the optimum.\n\nI still think that even needing E-store is counter-intuitive. You build e-storage to give your E more room to optimize your overdrive, since excessing E still means that E is somewhat wasted (it is spent on overdrive inefficiently). This is non-obvious to the user - most players never build a single E-store.\n\nalways wondering this, overdrive gets less effective at higher rates, correct? so if i have a full e storage, would it blow all the energy instantly, making like +100m for a half second or does it make +50m for 10 seconds, which would mean more m produced in the end? how will this change with the new system? numbers are made up obv.\n\nAlways did. The \"Overdrive\" system involves a logarithmic diminishing-returns function. Now, because it makes diminishing returns (IE overdriving 2E/mex gets you more Metal-per-E than overdriving 4E/mex) it means that you want to avoid spikes in overdrive - keeping overdrive a nice constant low (IE, I have 10 E over 5 seconds... better to spend 2E/second for each of those 5 seconds than to spend no E for 4 seconds and 10E in 1 second) means that the system managing the overdrive must be pretty complex to give the player optimal performance"}
{"text": "omeworld is a space RTS computer game. I bought it but never got around to playing beyond the first level, but it looked as slick as anything, and I still listen to the soundtrack on occasion.\n\nStill haven't played the original Homeworld, but Homeworld 2 was a lot of fun. Only RTS I've ever played where you keep the same set of units between levels, *and* (except in the case of forced jumps) automatically collect all resources on a level before moving on.\n\nIt's awesome sending a core of Ion Beam Frigates against an enemy Carrier, supplemented by bomber squadrons and a wing of fighters to fly cover for the whole operation.\n\nis this a proper map? i mean is it it authorised by the Serenity people.. will it be countered in future FF productions? like comics and such?\n\nDoes that matter? I don't understand the attitude that there's something wrong with a work of fiction if it isn't consistent with another work of fiction. It's all equally made-up anyway. And it's not as if the FF-verse is particularly consistent within itself, especially where cosmology and physics are concerned. The map is an imaginative and beautiful interpretation of something that's totally imaginary to begin with, and it's a whole lot more self-consistent than its source material. Who cares whether it's \"proper\" or not? All that should matter about something fictional is whether it's well-done and enjoyable. It's not like you're studying for a test and have to make sure your texts are accurate.\n\nThe only \"future productions\" likely to exist are RPG updates and further comics. It's been stated that future RPG updates will be consistent with this map. As for the comics, if there are any more, it'll be up to their creators whether they want to acknowledge the maps, but I doubt it will become an issue, because the stories in the comics are likely to focus on characters and action, not cartography. As with everything in fiction, they should be free to contradict the maps if that's what the story requires.\n\n__________________ Christopher L.

{"text": "think null would be more fun if the isk/resource gathering were mostly passive and players just needed to protect the isk generators from other players. Mining for instance, would more interesting if it was done by an anchorable mining structure. Make the mining structure drop a high value mining core, make the mining facilities show up on the map and you have a small gang objective. Instead of people zoning out to the sound of mining lasers, you form a defense fleet. If raiders overwhelm the defenders, it becomes a race to get the mining structures torn down before the attacking fleet gets to them.\n\nThe problem with small gang objectives is that they're ridiculously easy to steamroll with a handful of supers or a large gang.\n\nSo, people can complete them with small gangs or with supers and blobs.\n\nThats no reason to avoid placing them in EVE, just a reason to not have them be the sole challenge and to have them setup in such a way that multiple small gangs are favoured rather than the singular ball of death full of supercaps\n\nThe problem with small gang objectives is that they're ridiculously easy to steamroll with a handful of supers or a large gang.\n\nThe problem with \"small gang objectives\" is that they mean that the large sov holders now have a real incentive to hotdrop/blob/faggotry those small gangs other than just \"bored & lulz\", because every small gang will be a threat. The idea that they'll suddenly stop being hot-dropping faggot blobbers because now they actually have something at stake is almost surreally unrealistic.\n\nI've been supporting things like small (100 m3) anchorable ISK printing machines for ages. Each one has, say, an hour-long cycle, is anchored at a planet and shows up on system overview. If the cycle completes, you get some amount of money (if certain space is meant to be valuable, then base it on truesec) that's equivalent to maybe 30 minutes of ratting. The modules themselves are relatively cheap (~couple of cycles) and only one can be anchored per planet and only one per solar system per person. So a solar system with 10 planets could have 10 modules owned by 10 different players in it.\n\nIf a hostile arrives, they can offline it with a 5 minute timer, which you can cancel at any time if you're within 5km of it. If the thing goes offline, the cycle doesn't complete and you get nothing and the enemy gang can pop the module trivially (like, 50 rounds for a cane). What I'd hope would happen is that people roam around a constellation reactivating their modules periodically. When a hostile gang arrives, they would deactivate all the modules and wait for the defenders' response. A massive fleet wouldn't really be helpful, because it'd still take just as long, and 5 minutes gives enough time for a pre-formed defense gang to scout out the location and make a decision about whether to engage. If no fight is forthcoming, you've denied individual enemy pilots a significant chunk of income.\n\nObviously, there's modifications that could be made - eg. if warping to every planet is tedious for a gang, you could instead centralize them and cap how many pilots can use the ISK Printing Hub simultaneously and charge every player ISK up front to use it. Cancelling still takes 5 minutes, but cancels the cycles of everyone using that hub at the same time. The hub could also give the gang that successfully deactivates it all the players' cycle activation ISK (a fraction of what the cycle would have produced, maybe 5mil per active cycle).\n\nI'm sure there's some way to abuse this, but it seems like it would give more motivation to actually stay in PvP ships and form constellation-wide defense gangs that work together than just POSing up in your carebearing ship, because defending isn't worth the risk of losing your PvE ship.\n\nAlthough the more passive income and isk generators part sounds interestingIf you kill enough of them they stop fighting - Gen. Curtis Lemay\nFear the KKM\n\nYeah, I'm not sure what you do about the various barges. One thought I had for the Rorqual was to give it a pretty obscene bonus to the mining towers, but only while it's on-grid and in siege mode. Maybe strengthen its tank and repping abilities so that it can perform a bit better as a defensive emplacement. Then every now and then the mining towers can poop out a can for the Rorqual to tractor in and compressAnd there is a mission where you had to haul a cargo-hold full of 'planet-side currency' for a ransom or something. That money wasn't even worth using as toiletpaper for us capsuleers.\n\nOne quick way to making Sov more desirable would be to limit placing posses to systems you have sov in (not including lowsec or npc 0.0). Much of sov 0.0 only works if sov is something you want to have, and want to have more of.\n\nThis is a... really bad idea.\n\nStaging POS for an assault?\nStealth POS for whatever nefarious operations you can think of?\n\nStaging POS for an assault?\nStealth POS for whatever nefarious operations you can think of?\n\nBoo.\n\nSov holders already get an email announcing when any other entity anchors a POS in their space, but apparently that's not enough of an advantage, as expecting them to actually read warning mails is pretty unreasonable.\n\nBecause God knows, if there's one thing small gang PvPers ache to do, it's to sit around watching timers. Why that's the kind of gameplay that's made FW the runaway success it is!\n\nActually, having participated in FW, those plex timers can be pretty awesome.\n\nThe proble with FW is not that plexes require time to complete. That's fine. The problem is that to \"win a system\", you have to run 30 randomly-spawned plexes, which is best done in a PvE-fit ship in a way so that the enemy hopefully doesn't even notice.\n\nWhen we had actual fights about plexes (liberation of Siseide and Lantorn winter 2009, say), the timer stuff worked excellently to provide good fights with objectives.\n\nIn the end, it's just the same as shooting structures: There's a time limit until one side wins, and the other side need to stop them before that happens. With structures, the time depends entirely on the attackers dps, while with plexes, the time is fixed regardless of fleet size.\n\nWhile time-based stuff can be done completely wrong as well, don't write it off as generally bad :-)\n\nUnderstandably. Both FW and sov timers get some essential things wrong there (in addition to \"too many timers\").\n\nThe basic mechanic of \"getting a fight\" has roughly the stages challenge, scramble, engagement. Basically, the attackers march in on the battlefield and say \"I challenge you to a fight!\" (attack a structure, sit next to a capture point). The defenders then have \"some time\" to scramble together a defense fleet. Once they have one, there hopefully will be an engagement. If they do not engage, they lose \"something\".\n\nYou can balance the fleet sizes that will engage with the amount that is at stake and the time you give for scrambling.\n\nThe amount that is at stake primarily encourages attacking fleet sizes. E.g. \"this thing will gain us the whole system\" will encourage attackers to bring a huge fleet. Less grand objectives will attract smaller fleets (that's the reason why you rarely see 1k blobs hunt ratters - the potential gain is not exciting enough to attract so many people and make the cat herding worthwhile). On the other hand, it has to hurt the defender a bit, or he will just wait it out (one of the main FW problems).\n\nThe amount of time you give for scrambling is the main factor for the defense fleet. Defenders have the home advantage of (usually) being able to field bigger fleets, but they need time to form the fleet as the attack happened at a time not of their choosing. This is something FW did very right - if I see a minor plex going up in local, I know I have under 10 minutes to get together a frig/destroyer fleet to throw them out. Which gives an incentive to go in there with whatever you got after 5 minutes and hope it's enough. Giving longer will just increase the defender's blob size (a sov timer of 2-3 days is a very long \"scramble time\", hence the huge fleets).\n\nFW gets this wrong because the goals you can achieve are limited to bragging rights, and because the \"marching in and say 'I challenge you to a fight!'\" 90% of the time happens without the defender knowing about it, which removes the whole point of it.\n\nStructure shooting gets this wrong because it gets the scramble time wrong. Smaller fleets need longer to accomplish the goal, meaning the defender has more time to scramble a big fleet - a small fleet attacking should give less time to scramble, not more. It also encourages huge fleets because they get the objective done faster.\n\nSo if you want small-scale fights, you need to first identify something that's not earth-shattering to the defender, but still annoying; then pick a time you want to allow the defenders to react on; and then go with that. Ideas I've heard in the past are things such as \"stealing the contents of the current moon miner silo\", \"downgrading the industry index to reduce ratting efficiency\", even station services if they'd not require so much damage to take down, etc.\n\nJust as a silly example, with numbers requiring more thought and adjustment: Moon miners and silos become structures independent of POSes, but also invincible. When you \"hack\" one with a codebreaker, a timer of 20 minutes starts, after which you can open the silo and take the contents with you. A roaming fleet comes to a system and starts doing this. Now the defenders have 20 minutes to set up a fleet - no 60 minutes of \"x up x up\" in the Supercoalition Intel Channel, they need a fleet, fast. They might even be able to get a smaller fleet in first to distract the attackers so the bigger fleet can slowly form in the background, or whatever other tactics they can come up with.\n\nI think this would provide a lot more incentive to start small-scale fights.\n\nFake edit: *looks up* holy wall of text, that turned out longer than I thought it would ...\n\nTimers work pretty well in Battlefield style games where you sit near a flag for a bit and it switches sides. I like the idea of initiating a \"switch side\" timer where you need to be there at the start to push butan, and you need to come back to receive bacon, but you don't have to be there in the middle. The attackers can tag a few and then go do something else (roam, piss on miners, log off and masturbate) while the timer runs for, say, half an hour. That gives the defenders time to form up a few gangs to protect the flags, and the attackers can pick one, hit it, kill the defenders or die trying, and then receive bacon (or not if they're dead).\n\nLetting them tag multiple timers at once and not stick around helps with the issue of defenders just jumping all over the attacker with a horde (gotta spread out or teh bacons will be takens from one of the undefended sites), and also doesn't involve sitting around twiddling your dick and waiting for a long ass timer. Those are both good for gameplay.\n\nOnce a gang receives bacons from a flag, the flag goes into a 24hr cooldown, but flags that don't dump bacon can be hit again. Flags would be tied to stuff in the system -- maybe the indices, maybe giving a slight bonus to ratting income or some shit. Something with an effect that people care about, but nothing hugely important so that it's not mad lame. Only a couple per system, only in systems held by an 0.0 entity. Bacon could be anything -- some random loot, maybe some isk, even just LP with the pirate faction that hangs out in the area. Doesn't really matter so long as there's not a huge amount of it, and it's not totally fucking irritating to move. Figure the bacon isn't sufficient to reward more than 20 or so people -- a fleet doing it would get like 1isk each, but a small gang would do ok.\n\nSo, enough to encourage pvp by money grubbers in fast ships, but not enough to be worth doing with a blob.\n\nAnother rando idea. Maybe CCP could add in the ability to open an LP store (with the same kind of gear for every alliance) in player owned 0.0 stations. Doing specific stuff would earn you LP with the holding alliance. Takes up an office slot, costs money on the regular, in return your players can buy loot. Players can't hand out the LP, but players who do good things for the alliance (defending the bacon pumping flags, certain pve activities, working to raise the index) would get you some LP.\n\nNeat way for CCP to use the inner jew-whore of all Eve players to reward team effort in alliances. Doubt it would work well, it's just a mind shit. Problem with Eve is that anything an enemy would do that you could reward a player for undoing, the player could exploit by doing it and then fixing it. So if you reward them for killing reds or repairing a pos, players will set up sock puppet corps to kill for farming the LP or shoot their own pos to rep it. It is our way.\n\nThird idea is allowing corps/alliances to set a cash bounty (paid from corp/alliance wallet subsection set up for it) on reds/wts. Since it's player money it'd be policed better, and it'd offer an interesting tool for some corps. Doubt many would use it, but I can see where it'd be fun on occasion.\n\nNeat way for CCP to use the inner jew-whore of all Eve players to reward team effort in alliancesthere is the shares system, but that's kinda a joke. i tried to use it to collect money from alts, then give shares to my main to 'easily' move isk around between all my accounts, but long story short that doesn't work.\n\nSov needs pay days that don't filter through someYeah, but WoW has clearly marked foes. Eve doesn'tThat's why bacon dispensing pvp flags seemed like a good idea. They'd be harder to game, they'd involve something the enemy wants to defend, and they don't require hours of waiting or mindlessly shooting an inert structure. Just push butan, get fight, receive bacon.\n\nThat and the mining pos thing I was blabbing about before (basically a pos that sits on an asteroid belt but is small and kind of lame) would add more targets for people in small groups to shoot at and start fightsBut what you gain from killing a ship would naturally be less than it cost to make the ship.\n\nIf you kill enough of them they stop fighting - Gen. Curtis Lemay\nFear the KKM\n\nYou'd get a faked KM that looks legit, insurance on the T1, maybe corp reimburse and definitely whatever the kill bacon is.\n\nThat's why it seems pretty problematic to tie rewards directly to ships -- other than rewards created by the dead player him or her self, like gear or ransom or something -- as opposed to activities that result in pvp.\n\nSo transfer works, but creation of new loot don't because it can be gamed.\n\n\"Reality is that which, when you stop believing in it, doesn't go away.\"\n\nJoin Date\n\n2007 Jan\n\nPosts\n\n108\n\nR/P\n\n0.10185185185185\n\nRep Power\n\n7\n\nCCP will NEVER allow passive income on a wide scale for the Eve Community. I'm honestly surprised they did PI. CCP wants people in game and capable of being ganked. Anything you suggest that would detract from such goal is pointless waste of typing. They want people in their game not logging in once a week to push a button. I suspect they're itching for a reason to nerf tech and make Incursions the primary means of Alliance level income because it's an active form of wealth acquisition.\n\nHonestly, what would be nice is some way that you could put your shit out there to be ganked and earn passive income while you're in a defense fleet instead of mindlessly clicking on red crosses for hours.\n\nHonestly, what would be nice is some way that you could put your shit out there to be ganked and earn passive income while you're in a defense fleet instead of mindlessly clicking on red crosses for hoursIncursion 1.6 Client Update #1\nClient Update #1 for Incursion 1.6 To be deployed on May 31, 2011\nThis client update fixes a number of issues introduced with EVE Online: Incursion 1.6.

{"text": "I've read over the bit on the Webway in The Soul Reaver and then, loving what I saw there, I even picked up the Dark Eldar Codex. However, the bits on the Webway left me wondering about a few things.2) Are there natural points of access to the Webway, or are they all constructs?\n\n3) Is it possible to mount a Webway portal in a starship? Would this be a reasonable xenos component?\n\n4) Is it reasonable to have something like a Wraithgate (a man-portable Webway portal that can be used to move individuals and even small vehicles), and what would be the Availability?\n\n5) Can the Webway be accessed from the Warp? Would a Gellar Field interfere with using a Wraithgate (assuming that the Wraithgate was aboard the ship with the field up)?The Webway is typically depicted as having an atmosphere - Eldar forces of all kinds often deploy from the Webway on foot directly onto a planetary surface.\n\nHappyDaze said:\n\n2) Are there natural points of access to the Webway, or are they all constructs?\n\nThe Webway itself is an artificial creation, an evolution of the Warp Gate Network of the Old Ones. The points of access are thus all artificial, though that doesn't necessarily require an obvious physical gateway.\n\nHowever, webway tunnels can become damaged by psychic pressure, and part of the network was ruined during the Fall of the Eldar, resulting in sections exposed to the Warp, which are typically sealed off as soon as it is detected, by the Harlequins who guard the Webway.\n\nHappyDaze said:\n\n3) Is it possible to mount a Webway portal in a starship? Would this be a reasonable xenos component?\n\nAs your next question notes, Webway gates come in a variety of sizes. I imagine that many Eldar vessels employ webway gates as a means of deploying troops to and from a planetary surface, evacuating in case of emergency, and other situations. All Eldar Craftworlds contain a multitude of webway gates, ranging from massive ones able to transport starships, to those large enough only to convey individual travellers on foot.\n\nHappyDaze said:\n\n4) Is it reasonable to have something like a Wraithgate (a man-portable Webway portal that can be used to move individuals and even small vehicles), and what would be the Availability?\n\nI'd say Unique at best, as such items would be extremely difficult to find in the best of situations. I know of only one vehicle within the background that contains a Webway Gate - the Eldar Storm Serpent, a Super-Heavy Gravtank. I'd avoid trying to install them on any other vehicles.\n\nHappyDaze said: webway is a form of permanent gellar field within the warp. I doubt if a normal gellar field would effect it at all. Imperial gellar fields are like a tent compared to the reinforced bunker of a webway Cornwallis said:\n\nI've always been interested in the webway as well but my information is limited to\u2026 this thread and \"its a network of fast travel faster than warp jumps\u2026\n\ncan someone give me a quick summary of what they are, look like etcetera? sounds like inverted tunnel reality as of this thread, but again I'm very ill informed.\n\nI try to think of it as a form of controlled wormhole, but with multiple entrances and exits, sprawling throughout the immaterium, generally not caring at all which way that reality chooses to twist. The Webway allows you to travel through the condensed space of the immaterium without risk, but with the caveat that the locations are fixed to gateways.\n\n\"It's never too late to panic.\" ~ Popular Valhallan folk saying\n\nSince so many seem to have trouble understanding Technology, Machine SpiritsMechanicus: Link.There is a point in \"Lure of the Expanse\" where the players can navigate their ship through a webway portal. Directly speaking this does not adversely affect themIt doesn't obey the natural laws of reality, because it isn't part of reality.\n\nA Gellar Field is a simple concept in its own right - a pocket of reality to ward a vessel from the corrosive un-substance of the Warp. The Webway is more than less than that - it is safe, in its own right, from the toxic influence of the raw Immaterium, yet it is also beyond the physical reality that most beings call home, and contains its own dangers and hazards to the unwary because of its extradimensional nature. The Eldar have long known many of the mysteries of the Webway, enough to be wary of its perils and watchful for them enough to navigate around them, but few know the Webway as the Harlequins of the Laughing God do, and they are loathe to speak even a fraction of its secrets.\n\nIn short\u2026 it's an extradimensional labyrinth realm, eternally shifting. The petty nuisances of the material universe need not apply.\n\nFgdsfg said:\n\nThe Webway isn't purely a travel medium, though - the Eldar have had settlements within the Webway for tens of thousands of years at least, most of which have long since been fused with the Dark City of Commorragh and now sit beneath the light of stolen suns. Further, the smaller passages and gateways are actually far more common than the ones large enough to accomodate starships. Enough of the Webway is habitable to unprotected life that creatures actually inhabit it.\n\nThe heart of the Webway concept is closer to myth than science fiction. It is a place, but not one within physical reality. It is the paths that Eldritch beings use to step between the stars, their passage unseen and unnoticed by man. It is a gloaming place, bathed in perpetual half-light, home to tricksters, sages and bloodthirsty monsters alike. It is one of the wonders of the galaxy, the result of science so advanced that lesser creatures call it magic, and sorcery so complex that it may as well be the work of gods, so incomprehensible is its scale and the splendour of its construction.\n\nOn a related note, I like to keep more than a little mystery with the Eldar - they're ancient, cruel and inscrutable beings of alien intellect and an inhuman capacity for extremes of emotion, whose science seems as witchcraft to the men of the Imperium, and whose magic is subtle and potent in equal measure. As Phil Kelly and Jes Goodwin mentioned in their designer notes for the Dark Eldar revamp, the Dark Eldar are the nasty, nightmarish side of fairy stories\u2026 the impossible, spectral beings who appear in the night and spirit away friends and family members, who thirst for terror and sup upon agony. I like the concept, and I really feel that the Eldar as a whole benefit from being a little more \"capricious fae beings\" and a little less \"pointy-eared aliens\". They move in silence and secrecy between worlds along glittering paths that only they can walk, arrive unheralded and depart as suddenly, weave spells of misdirection and misfortune and their motives are seldom known to any but themselvesThey move in silence and secrecy between worlds along glittering paths that only they can walk, arrive unheralded and depart as suddenly, weave spells of misdirection and misfortune and their motives are seldom known to any but themselves.\n\nIME, that kind of thing tends to fall apart when they are placed into the role of PCs.\n\nOn an unrelated note: Yes, there must be some kind of atmosphere in the webway. The Dark Eldar Codex mentions several nasty beasties entering the webway through a splintered portal and spreading to other worlds.\n\nIME, that kind of thing tends to fall apart when they are placed into the role of PCs.\n\nIsn't that what PC's are best at though?\n\nThe players come up with a 'plan' and hilarity ensuesGreat concepts to know. I hadn't the foggiest idea on what the Webway was. Don't know to much about the Eldar myself, other than they are old, created the all seeing eye by accident, and don't appear to like procreating allot"}

Also, I should point out that scans of an image that you claim shows something that supports your argument, isn't an extraordinary request for evidence.

Yet he cannot detect Dark Templar, thus there's no reason to believe that the opposition can either. Is this clear enough for you?\n\nSee above. Stop mithering please and get on with it. Multi-spectral capability obviously indicates seeing in more than one spectrum. i.e. More than visible light. That you can post \"it can be summed up as sensory equipment, because thats all it means\" is simply wilful ignorance. It isn't uncivil of me to point this out I feel.\n\nYour reluctance to substantiate your claims with regards the capabilities of DT cloaks is obviously an obstacle here. You \"just pointing out what doesn't work\" still comes with a burden of proof.\n\nI've bolded the bits you keep posting about, without actually substantiating. Is that clear enough for you?\n\nI'd also point out that when I expanded my information about their Auspex capabilities, I gave examples, radiation, gases, biological life signs. I appreciate you need to try and needle me about little bits like that as part of your style, but I'd ask you drop the attitude, and be objective about this. but your insistance on claiming its \"useless\" isn't really justified. I'll happily continue argue about it with you if you like, but I'll continue to add information as I post that could be relevant.\n\nRadiation is obviously not visible light, you don't need a special tool to detect that in the context of a battlefield scanner. The reference to things invisible to the human eye gives us basically the electromagnetic spectrum, how much of it is unclear. \" TerminatorInvisible gases probably reflects this description of Power armour auto-senses.\n\nAngel of Darkness\nBoreas paused for a second and looked at the villagers who were gathering close by, the auto-senses of his skull helm casting a red tinge on the proceedings. Olfactory filters allowed him to identify the contents of the atmosphere - mostly oxygen and nitrogen, but with heavy traces of sulphur, carbon from the fires, the sweat of the villagers;\n\nSigns of biological life is seperate from these, It could incorporate all of the above, thermal imaging for heat signatures, respiratory byproducts etc that fit the profile of living organisms the auspex \"knows\".Hilariously, biological electromagnetic fields are associated with the \"biorhythm\" madness you linked in an attempt to be silly, so thanks for the link! But obviously detecting electromagnetic fields isn't silly in itself.I'd normally go with a bit of give and take in a versus debate, but you won't budge on anything, and you've admitted before you are willing to misrepresent things because you think \"the opposition\" is doing so.\n\nDoesn't leave me much option to take stuff on faith man.?\n\nJust to be clear on the matter, I asked a specific question, can they attack whilst cloaked anywhere else other than the gameLiberty's Crusade\nIt was blood poetry, war ballet. She had reached the center of the command center now, armed with\nher knife and a slugthrower. She would wink into existence, slit a throat, then wink out again. Marines\nwould rush to that location, and she would appear a few feet away, firing a burst point-blank into the\nhelmet of her target. Then gone, then back again, this time with a spinning kick that roke the neck of a\nbellowing officer. WhilstGiven their mobility advantage, they could probably exploit that pretty well I suppose. The context of the debate isn't enough to discern that methinks.Firstly, you claimed Marines had an entire range of sensory capabilities, includingThird time I asked for multiple things and you've dodged or refused mate.\n\nAnyway, I take it you are claiming that \"motion tracker\" in this context means some sort of vibration sensor? So something that detects the vibrations of footsteps would detect Dark Templar, or simply the noise they make potentiallyOne that apparently would detect Dark Templar. Enhanced aural abilities might hear them as well, although at this point, it looks like a collective approach of multiple sensor feeds might the thing.\n\n'Report,' Nisri said as Hussari saluted him. 'Did you see what crashed?'\n'No sir,' Hussari responded, 'only what you saw, and it didn't crash. I swear it was decelerating before it vanished.'\n'Auspex,' Turk called out, 'anything yet?'\n'Negative,' the operator called out. 'We picked up a slight impact tremor, but nothing even close to a meteor or orbit strike. 'Whatever it was, it made a controlled landing.'\n'It was guided down, sir,' Turk told Nisri. 'Anything on vox?'\n'Negative,' a vox operator responded. 'More background static than normal. Whatever fell or landed disturbed the sand and generated an electrical field like the ones we've experienced. If there's a vox signal anywhere in there, they can't hear or receive.'\n'No contact,' Nisri instructed. 'There's no reason to alert them to our presence just yet.'\n\nIn other words -- no. They can't detect cloaked units in-universe? Pretty heavy evidence against them being able to do it in this scenario.\n\nThis rather reminds me of the time you decided EMP couldn't work against Protoss, because not all EMP is made equal etc. I sense you don't want the same sort of logic to apply here though.Its difficult for me to compare and contrast, because of your point blank refusal to provide basic information to back up your claims, followed by continuous dodgingI probably didn't, I think at this point, wikipedia is a lot better sourced than you are! I took a look at biological signs of life further up.\n\nl33telboiI'm really not playing the game of restating my position every other post because you are trying to turn this into another drawn out grindfest. My posts are clear, get on with it, and provide evidence for your claims.\n\nTry quoting properly. There's an alarm function on this forum but it doesn't work unless you're quoting someone correctly. And I'm not so much restating my position as I am pointing out that you carry the burden of proof if you want to say they can see through Dark Templar cloaks. Similarly the evidence for my position has been provided.\n\nMulti-spectral capability obviously indicates seeing in more than one spectrum. i.e. More than visible light. That you can post \"it can be summed up as sensory equipment, because thats all it means\" is simply wilful ignorance.\n\nNo. It's the unfortunate truth. Multi-spectral and energy sensors means exactly nothing without further clarification. They mean even less considering everything from marines upwards have multi-spectral and energy sensors. The simple IR vision marines have counts as multi-spectral sensors, not to mention sensor towers and what they have.\n\nIf you want to say these sensors can see through Dark Templar cloaks just because they're multi-spectral then marines would also be able to see through cloaks. But they can't.\n\nYour reluctance to substantiate your claims with regards the capabilities of DT cloaks is obviously an obstacle here. You \"just pointing out what doesn't work\" still comes with a burden of proof.\n\nNo it doesn't, because then you'd be asking me to prove a negative. If you want to claim they can see through the cloaks then find something to substantiate that. \"Because they have sensors\" is not good enough given that everything presented so far can be replicated with bog-standard marines.\n\n[uote]I'd also point out that when I expanded my information about their Auspex capabilities, I gave examples, radiation, gases, biological life signs.[/quote]\n\nAnd which of these do you think would work and why? Radiation? We already know that they're not visible on thermal vision, and don't show up on radar, so unless there's greater reasoning behind this then it doesn't work. Gases? What gases? You need to clarify. If you think the protoss emit some form of gas that the opposition can detect then state what that gas might be and why they would be detected. Biological lifesigns? Again, what does that mean, what specifically are the sensors looking for?\n\n\"\n\nWell I don't think Dark Templar are radioactive to any significant degree, and we've already been over electromagnetic radiation.\n\nTerminatorSigns of biological life is seperate from these, It could incorporate all of the above, thermal imaging for heat signatures, respiratory byproducts etc that fit the profile of living organisms the auspex \"knows\".\n\nLet me just stop you there. Unless you can specifically prove that the capabilities of one system is also present on another, you need not bother. Just because Termiantor auto-senses are the equivalent to auspex stuff, doesn't mean they replicate every feat or work exactly the same. You've mentioned space marine sensors and even IG sensors to support your position... but they are not what the Dark Templar are fighting in this case.\n\nOh, and you realize of course that you're holding a double standard here, don't you? If you can take a Terminator's sensors and say they exist on the auspex stuff, then I can take ghost cloaking devices and attribute their function to that of dark templar, because they too are each others equivalents.\n\nAlso, ultraviolet and X-ray are a form of electromagnetic radation, which you already mentioned.It detects various radiation emissions, yes, you've said this a few billion times by now.Uh-huh. So it's the same story as last time. The pictures are too bad quality for you? Even though I admittedly have a crappy camera on my phone, I have to say that the pictures posted in this case are good enough to demonstrate dark templar cloaked and attackingGhosts remain cloaked when attacking, unless they specifically chose to reappear. If you ever played Starcraft 2 you probably even saw Nova stabbing Tosh to death... while cloaked. Truly there is no unit in Starcraft that has been show to have to drop the cloak when attacking.\n\nFor good measure, from Spectres: \"Still cloaked, Nova raced forward, took quick aim at the zergling on Godard's back, and fired, using her psionic abilities to teek the round slightly to the right as the marine stumbled again. The alien's head exploded and the creature dropped, twitching, to the ground. Not breaking stride, she leapt over a zergling carcass and put ten rounds below the bony carapace of a roach, avoiding its steaming blood as it jerked and writhed in the dust. Before if could regenerate, she met its alien, glassy stare and sent a teek blast directly into its skull, killing it instantly.\"\n\nNot so much thin as it is obvious grasping at straws. If they can \"see\" air currents, then no doubt that would be said. Similarly I have a hard time figuring out why these can't see invisible critters in 40K if indeed they can see displaced air currents. Far as I know cloaking doesn't make you intangible in 40K.\n\nWhilstDark templar don't have a distortion on them, far as I know. Unless they're using the weird chamelon thing described in Queen of Blades.\n\nFirstly, you claimed Marines had an entire range of sensory capabilities, includingYou've been in a billion debates regarding Starcraft before, and it's been mentioned and quoted just as many times: \"The display on the inside of his visor began to flash insistently. The motion sensors had picked up activity in the blackness of the spore tunnel that stretched before him, but Ardo's mind seemed frozen, unable to grasp its importance.\"\n\nThird time I asked for multiple things and you've dodged or refused mate.\n\nI haven't refused providing anything. Quotes from novels I can do easy peasy, ask and you shall receive.\n\nAnyway, I take it you are claiming that \"motion tracker\" in this context means some sort of vibration sensor? So something that detects the vibrations of footsteps would detect Dark Templar, or simply the noise they make potentially.\n\nI don't know what they do. It's not clarified anywhere. They're motion detectors, but that means quite a few things. They detect hovering units, so you vibrations? Maybe, maybe notThis sounds an awful lot like the novel where IG fight tyranids on some desert world, where they, among other things, get killed by invisible tyranids they can't see. And naturally these are IG, not Eldar.\n\nThis rather reminds me of the time you decided EMP couldn't work against Protoss, because not all EMP is made equal etc. I sense you don't want the same sort of logic to apply here though.\n\nReally? Is that why every post of mine so far has started with that exact same logic, \"senors\" and \"sensors\" doesn't need to be the same just because they're both called sensors? And you once again hold the contrary opinion, stating that auspex must be the same even though found on vastly different systems and other races?\nLet me make this easy: Instead of throwing out a billion different suggestions that have already been mentioned and some of which you don't even know how work, how about you try and provide a single system and argue why it would be able to find Dark Templar? You've probably mentioned electromagnetic sensors a dozen times over in this thread, but repeating the same argument in different parts of the post does not mean you've provided two separate arguments.\n\nI think Terrorsight was mentioned to be a psyker thing in Decent of Angels. Though, that could be another `sight` that is mentioned then. I don't have the book on me, but it when the initiate fights his first monster before Dark Angels show up."}

Only that the producer of said Halos were. And Delta Halo still exists as far as we know. Not to mention any other Forerunner Flood-keeping/ studying facilities[quote=joniman1236|message:31339700] I heard that the ship you see is the last of the Forrerunners or the LAst of the Prophets tracking down the Master cheif because hebasically ruined there triupmh to win the war!\n\nI heard that the ship you see is the last of the Forrerunners or the LAst of the Prophets tracking down the Master cheif because hebasically ruined there triupmh to win the war!\n\nWhoever told you that is most likely high. That is a Shield World, and obviously Forerunner tech, not a Covenant ship. It's blue, not purple-pinkish. And after at least three years (Halo Origins date) the covenant Loyalists would have been push extremely far back into Covenant space, due to the Human-Separatist fleets obliterating them at every turn.\n\nIt appears there's been some rumors about Cortana playing a much bigger role in Halo 4:\n\nquote 8bitfix.com\n\nThroughout the Halo series we've seen everyone's favorite artificial intelligence (AI), Cortana supporting the story along with Master Chief. She's also provided players with tactical options, making her a great companion while in combat.\n\nCortana was created to adapt, a feature not shared by other AI, though the ability to learn, think, and reason comes with a cost. An AI gifted with these features typically has a lifespan of about seven years, and as Cortana has explained, can eventually \"think herself to death\". Can the emotional depth of such a non-human character indicate a new step in Cortana's presentation? After all, we could see a strong bond between Cortana and Master Chief especially towards the conclusion of Halo 3.\n\n\"I can tell you Cortana's going to be a focal point of Halo 4, for sure.\" Said Frank O'Connor, 343's franchise development director. I think a lot of people are speculating on Cortana's age and the effects of age on an AI, there's this thing called Rampancy which is really just any AI thinking itself to death and Cortana's been around for a while and most AIs have a lifespan of seven years. Cortana's a little bit different in that she's been exposed to a lot more technology and information than other AIs via the Forerunner lore and mythos. But her state of mind, her relationship with the Chief, they're all going to be core elements of the story and the 'human drama' as it were in Halo,\" O'Connor added.\n\nCould we possibly assume that Cortana can take a \"physical\" form for the events of Halo 4? The fact that these types of AI live for a short time indicates more dramatic interaction between the lead characters. Who knows how much time has passed since Chief has been floating around in space? Halo 4 will be the start of a new trilogy, this time under the direction of 343 Industries. An ancient threat comes to wage terror on the universe and Master Chief and Cortana return to confront it.\n\nSo yeah, I'll be posting more of these when I find them, these little tid-bits.\n\nWell from what we could see it's a forrunner planet, seen in the teaser and the H3 ledgendary ending so there will be robots on it, and from halo ledgends there were glimpses shown of cortana going rampant. So in her rampancy and her inclusion of forerunner tech in her, could she take control of the (Shield world(?)) and its machines? could cortana be the main antagonist?+1\n\nChances are humans find you at some point since the warthog is confirmed to be in, so will there be (I was gonna say johnson but then I remembered :'( ) arbiters or some of the names ODST's? how about a Halsey appearence?

{"text": "174\n\nEdit:New factionalized version [link] -------------- Dark force Devourer,destroyer class war ship, its about the same size as a standard Light force destroyer. And yes there are going to be 4 in all , hunger ,devourer, pestilence and black hole classes.\n\nI tried my best to bring out the main parts of my idea, the smooth polished rock like front end the asteroid like back end and the tentacles.\n\nThis ship is broken up in 3 parts , the main part is the smooth front end. Its covered in a smooth dark skin that enables it to not only spread dark skin when it rams into something but absorbs massive amounts of energy. The interior of this section is like a living organism and is grown not built.\n\nFighters launch from dark skin covered hanger bays.\n\nThe smother area can also easy fire dark skin spikes which pierce through most metals like a hot knife through butter they also spread dark skin corrupting anything it touches.\n\nThe asteroid part is filled with tunnels leading to bio machines that build and launch dark skin spires. They act like large missiles that can fire dark skin spikes as well as spread large amounts of dark skin on impact.\n\nThe asteroid part is part of an asteroid that was infested with Xai'irthi (insect race of ambiguously insane male warriors, think DBZ but more powerful at times) then its taken and infused with dark skin and used as a launch base for dark spires, warriors and even space ship fighters.\n\nThe tentacles are grown from dark skin and connect the first and second parts of the ship together.They act as engines moving the ship. They also are used in combat constricting the flow of energy through mass absorption and crushing whatever is left.\n\nLight Force ships can not be crushed, however once a section has been covered in dark skin it may be weakened enough for dark skin to seep in through the seams. When a section has tentacles attached too it it can not generate enough energy and unless they are removed the ship will be quickly covered in dark skin then devoured from the inside out.\n\nNearly anything can be transported through the dark skin when enough seeps into a light force vessel troops and Xai'irthi can go in and take out any resistance.\n\nDark skin can be held back with energy force fields but you need enough power to block it off, dark skin alone is not enough to take down a fully equipment light force vessel, Devourers must attach themselves to a covered light force ship in order to finish it off.\n\nEdit Forgot to mention just how LF defeats a DF vessel, they basically gang up on it and burn off the dark skin using their main cannons. Dark skin can spread through absorbing energy but at certain points it grows weak enough to where a bit more energy will burn it away. Once a ship is strip of its outer layer of dark skin its only a matter of time before its filled with so much energy that its structure collapses.\n\nIt takes 50-60% of universe destroying power to deal with a normal dark force devour/destroyer, twice as much for the next class 10 times as much for the last class and half as much for the lowest class.\n\nThere is not a lot I can do with it with my skills, its more a placeholder or my attempt to draw it out, I hope to have commissions done based off my doodles. But other than that could you elaborate more? Do you mean emblems, racing/detailing strips and what not?\n\nGood thing you asked as I am making up things as I go it helps to have someone ask questions. I want to say there are no factions in current Light forces but even if they are, none use emblems persay (energy signatures sure but no obvious visual markers as LF is on the bland tried and true ultra modernized look,hell the cities are gray and unremarkable but for the entertainment/market districts.) One of the reasons for this is during the first war of creation you had more factions and less general unification, during the current 2nd more bland and darker era of the war of creation Light forces is less rag tag and much more organized and standardized to stifling proportions.\n\nNow dark forces is a bit different their Generals(who make up a counsel/congress of darkness of which lead dark forces by general non compete pledges that they get out of by showing how weak the defeated are lovely back stabbing bunch they are, I think light forces is ran by a counsel of adjudicators/judges but I'll have to check my notes....or just add to them..LOL ) As I was saying generals are more outspoken and indevendaul. So there should be clear marks of identification, I am thinking unqie ram horns/skulls popping up in the designs maybe on the front and sides of the base ship design. *steals some ideas from rage's bandit factions...lulz* I'll see if I can factionalize the current drawing some as a 2nd revision"}

What you would end up with is people randomly flying around locations hoping to find someone. Or even worse camping outside of Qo'Nos and Sol.\n\nOpen PvP needs to be in area restricted locations so that it doesn't hinder those gamers who do not want to participate in it. We have the so called neutral sector now which would prove to be great although for it to work openly they would need the current sector space to be completely different. Something more akin to EVE for example where you are stuck in a vast expanse of emptyness and you pass the various planets and whatnot.\n\nEven then it would probably be too large an area for how many people are actively playing and willing to join in. The more confined the space for 'open' PvP the more intense action you are going to get. It also increases the odds of being able to just jump into that location knowing there will be PvP instead of a wild goose hunt.\n\nalso the transfer sytstem would only be allowed 1 time per character slot available to you or something so that eventually it would become one of two servers. and stand on its own.\n\nno difficulty slider as enemy engagments should just be what they are and the pvp would add the flavor..\n\nlastly, factions are only worth a damn if you can invade and cause mayhem against your enemy faction..\nwhy even introduce that word faction to something that is clearly designed as something completely difrent than that... klingongs are almost a \"hey youve played through as a fed now try a klingon with their diffrent BO set-ups and nostop grinding\"\n\nbut ya to sum it all up open pvp in a small instanced area is not OPEN... its just people asking for 100vs 100 fleet vs fleet... which would be great but lets be hontest thats a bit of a leap if you think about it...\n\na open pvp shard is essential to any faaction based mmo.\n\nand yes i would love to invade qu nos and destroy the countless little lowlifes untill they switched toons and called on back-up from fleet members and its a epic battle like people want... oh and a good fleet action reward for blowing up the planet (or starbase one) would be great. something like random loot drop per team within range of the area or something. have this also unlock ONE \"special\" mission available to only the faction that has destroyed the opposing factions base... (if both sides destroy the other teams base a 2 part \"special\" mission could be unlocked were the winning faction of the first \"special\" mission gets to go for the 2nd \"special\" mission...\n\nideas are easy to come by but the thing that counts is how its implemented... i would be happy with open world pvp in instanced zones and for there to be far less instanced zones (as in mayb only 50 starbase ones.....)"}
{"text": "Superweapons off-switch\n\nThey need to go.\n\nBFroberg\n\nRight, so it may just be me - but I feel like the AI is drastically over-exploiting the super-weapon abilities. I'm very good at keeping the AI out of my space, which usually results in only my border-planets being probed, as such these planets are subject of relentless super-weapon strikes, and I have to keep rebuilding them as a result. More often than not, I can select it for rebuild and it'll be destroyed again a few seconds later.\n\nWith large games where you need to focus your efforts on one AI at a time, it can become incredibly frustrating.\n\nSince the super-weapons are ludicrously powerful to begin with, and the audio that triggers whenever one is used is annoying too - I would greatly appreciate the ability to disable the superweapon structures altogether.\n\nYour not alone, and I agree. Ive had to change my tactics because of these weapons. And yes, the announcement that ones being fired drives one crazy. I may have to mod this one out myself and remove the sound file associated with it.\n\nbtw, there is a discussion about this one in another thread. so its not unknown to the devs.\n\njust played thru Rebellion for my first time and I put the AI on Easy since its been awhile and i just wanted to get a feel for it. lol next thing i know; Im on tier 3 of researching and the Researching AI (pretty sure) is pounding me with Novaliths.\n\nPersonally, I would liek to see an option to turn off or make superweapons have diplomatic effect like using nukes in CIV, where the user of superweapons take a major diplomatic penalty for using them.\n\nI think the problem with Rebellion is that the AI's ability to build and use a fleet has been greatly reduced for whatever reason (I.e. it doesn't know how to use the new features yet). As a result it doesn't do much but build up its own planets, meaning it gets novaliths far faster than normal. It simply doesn't know any other effective way to attack. I'm sure it will be fixed later once all the features are in and they start returning the AI to competence.\n\nI was up two-three levels of research, had colonized Gateway (had to flee from my starting planet due to AI pressure..) and had begun to colonize the resource system to finance my empire.\n\nI was struggling just maintaining sufficient defence on the Gateway system - and before I even had enough labs to even think of starting research proper - the AI was sending Novialith shots from all its planets.\n\nMaybe I could've done differently, but the AI still seems Novialith heavy. I'm hoping its a bug like the others here say.\n\nAlso, if you're playing multi-star systems you're bound to have to focus on one enemy at a time when you're playing at Cruel or higher, lest they just walk over your fleet. I.e. it's likely that the other AI will be allowed to grow. If they have an entire star system of Novialiths, well, how can you even (with late game slow-down) manage to get at them before they've extinguished life entirely on all other planets. Barring starbases on all your planets, of course.\n\nYup, playing against 6 AI's all I hear is \"Superweapon activated on ?\" and while I'm mopping up 1 star system, the 4 other AI take 4-5 of my planets at a time. Not to mention the time when my own allied AI nukes planets with novalith a SECOND before I'm about to capture them.\n\nTwo Nova shots is enough to kill an asteroid with a shield, Preator, they can barely survive one shot with a shield and upgraded infrastructure.\n\nThe better counter is to use starbases with auxiliary government to prevent loss of the planet, though that doesn't stop the giant hits to your income from your population dying. The fact is that the level of Nova spam the Loyalist AI is doing right now is ridiculous, and is causing them not to invest in more sensible things, like fleets and defenses.\n\nAlso agreed. I just find them annoying now. One Novalith is one thing, but once a few of them are up it's just dumb. I had an enemy AI come at me with a few, so I just built one on every planet I could and let them spam him to death.\n\nAm I seriously the only one who has found a VERY effective counter to the nova-spam?\n\nA shield generator on each of your planets pretty much makes the novalith useless (unless they fire 10 at one asteroid, which they won't)\n\nThen, how would you counter it if you are Vasari or Advent? Both races dont have planetary shields and axillary government.\n\nAlso, countering a Nova spam isnt that fun to begin with. That, i think is the main problem. I think a limit for the number of super weapons buildable if the damage isnt reduced. Or reduce the damage if things were kept the way it is now.\n\nI do enjoy playing as Rebel in aggressively killing off their Novaliths. However the constant bombardment at my planets isnt fun at all, if it manage to kill of my planets each time it fires. I think i slight damage nerf has to be applied.\n\nI think it's a pretty complicated situation though as if you overnerf novalith, you'll get a problem of making Loyalist too weak. If it's left the way it is now, it will be incredibly annoying if you add Advent and Vasari in."}

The energy weapons always hit, and when they blast a shield section, the torp can hit home properly. That's why I suspect you'll get more benefit from 4 disruptor coils (even more so with the javelin getting an additional bonus).\n\nEngines, yeah. I'm inclined to say \"go for the efficient engines you get as a reward in one of the first missions\". They are nice and free. The most noticeable upgrades would be the pricy ones from the rep system. I'd say they're the least important part of your ship though, surprisingly. Shields are a matter of personal taste too, really. I use covariant and resilient shields, equally.\n\nDeflectors do come in a lot of flavors.

There's also a glitch with the \"Blossom\" weapon when one of the sprouter seedling deals explode too early for no reason. Anyone else encountering these problems?\n\nall of your things was not glitches, the blossom is the first shot you shot will explode, you idiot, idioticy number 1 ecountered.\nand the fireworks and double palm disapear if one of the shots hit a wall before it expldoes, kChamp wanted it to be like this, so all taht you posted was just waste, idiocity.\n\nTacocubes is wrong, but coherent. FlashTom is correct, but damn near incoherent due to all the solecism.\n\nYou need to consider several factors when PvP'ing: Hull Research, Hull verses hull, Commander, Weapon research, and gem casting / bionic chips. Maxing out your weapon of choice and your shield tech will increase attack and allow to attack multiple targets per strike. Your hull may cause you to take an automatic 5% increased damage taken; for example, a frigate verses a cruiser\u2014automatically the cruiser adds 5% damage against a frig, and also the frig takes 5% increased damage against cruiser. Not to mention if your commander is a C rank in your hull which takes 10% more damage.\n\nWhich brings me to the next factor, commanders. You do not really want to use less than a B rank in your weapon and hull. S rank is the best, but be happy with an A if you are free-to-play. Before you level your commanders, make sure to hover your mouse over their attributes to learn the growth rate of each stat. When dealing with named commanders, certain attributes will increase their chance to proc their skill. Simply use a reset card to reset the growth rate. Keep in mind if your commander is above level 1 it will reset back to level 1. Ideally you want over 4.0 growth rate on your proc skill. (As far as I know, it only goes as high as 5.0)\n\nObviously you need to increase your hull and weapon research to give yourself a more powerful ship design. Do not mix your fleets with different weapons unless you know how to layer them properly. I'm not going to explain the importance of casting your gems and chips because it should be obvious. That and I'm tired of typing, quite frankly.\n\nInstead of putting this stuff in the game, how about fixing what is broken and actually improving the experience in total, not putting a single commander for paying people and claim it to be a big release? Prioritize guys\u2026\n\nPretty much what James said. Officially they aren't allowed. In reality IGG won't do anything since the majority of alt players pay cash. Do they massively imbalance the game? Absolutely. Would it be fairer if they were genuinely disallowed/shutdown? Yes. Is it going to happen? No. Alts have become so ingrained into the ethos of the game that quality players who otherwise stick to the rules and are respected by the community simply don't see them as 'cheating'. It's that kind of 'everyone does it so it's okay' attitude that most people have to downloading music illegally etc.\n\nGiven that, your options are \u2013 join them and make one yourself to try and keep up; just keep playing and accept some people will have massively more resources than you purely for this reason; find them and farm them (with probable retaliation from their main account); keep giving IGG a hard time on the very small off-chance they do something about it.\n\nactualy its bad if somone gets evriting w/alts instead of buying resources and stuf from IGG for real cash.\n\nYes but going after alts is a time/money investment for IGG\u2026 with marginal utility of\u2026?\n\nI crud up this game's forums precisely because this is the worst of a series of farm-to-farm wait-to-play games that have been on Kong. Caesary was indeed much better directed towards at least a game-like purpose in playing it, but like you say, just because it was a ripoff of Senatry, I think it was. I forget. It was actually a less polished game that Caesary then improved on, but problem was, the guy behind Caesary was a former employee of the original game and just ripped it off piecemeal.\n\nLord of Ages is a little more decent but the problem there too is that it's easy to forget what you're farming anything for (more farming).\n\nAs for what Fortunate may have wanted me to say: this game is run by Google Translate and people who don't understand gameplay design and instead just wanted to draw spaceships and charge people money for as corny items as they can get away with, like \"Legendary Robert\" or \"Galactic Gumballs.\" As a result this game is populated by gamers with extremely low standards who are quite entertaining to watch.\n\nnot really not really not really born do you know what the point was i dont see currency games get it change to smaller amounts often on kongregate also people wont like having to spend more\n_________________________________________________________________________________________\ni hate the world but the world loves me\n\nYup. Point still missed\u2026\n\nHint: They will cost more in a market sense because the value of MP by any market definition has to be the value set by the greatest value pack, which will not be the smaller amounts. So, they are almost surely going to \"end up costing you more anyway,\" especially since paying players very rarely end up not making more than one purchase. To think that Fortunate was talking about the actual price in this context is missing the point in pretty much the most inane way possible.\n\nCongrats on needing it spelled out.

{"text": "I think that's actually the biggest weakness of X3 games, that fighter ships are both expensive and a huge chore to equip once purchased. If you could just have an own shipyard which would spit M5s, M4s and M3s (or whatever they are called in Rebirth) like it was a cheap Indian car factory, we could have swarms of them and while it'd still cost us money, sending 50 fighters against 50 suddenly wouldn't mean having to spend the entire following day replenishing the fleet.\n\nSo please make fighters relatively cheap and easy to replace with own production and non-problematic repairs.\n\neveryone who has problems outfitting fighters should really read this I can outfit 100 fighters faster than two destroyers with it\n\nbut on topic - its not clear whether we have fighters at all, a somewhat similar conversation was in a recent carrier thread, where myself and a someone else pointed out that it is not clear whether we will have fighters or no at all\n\nit could turn out that there is just a variety of drones (assault, torpedo etc) that come with all the needed guns/shields/etc from the start and do not need to be outfitted at all\n\nsame goes for costs I doubt that they are too expensive. Note \"too\", they probably wont be cheap if they are strong, if they are weak than still as you will need hundreds to win relative price wont be cheap, because if it was than there would be no need in destroyers, right?I'd rather put those trained pilots into a more heavily armored and armed ship, like a frigate or destroyerNot really and not easily.\n\nWith proper security measures, it becomes next to impossible (especially if you change encryption often..by the time the enemy manages to crak one, you're already using another)\n\nAnd if you are using a closed system then it literally IS impossible to hack itYou counter a tech, the enemy counters your counter, you counter his counter-counter etc... that's how military devices have been developed since before history and if you make all your fighters drones the enemy will find a way to counter them.\n\nWell, we saw in those screen shots that there are different tiers of fighter drones like in the other X games, so I can't imagine it's much of a stretch to envision cheaper versions of each drone that could be more disposable.\n\nAlso, I figure that capital ships like carriers will have special types of drones that are too large to be used with the PoA and are essentially fighters that you buy preassembled.\n\nWhat would be really cool is if they let us design specific types of carrier based fighter drones or change their loadouts for specific missions etc. I just can't imagine there only being one size of drone and launching them all from the PoA. The PoA is only an M6 size or thereabouts so it doesn't make sense to have it carrying \"big\" drones. Of course, that's just my own two cents"}
{"text": "No, it really wouldn't. It isn't like artificial gravity isn't a completely different common inclusion into sci-fi. And such a defense would suffer major advantages and drawbacksA gravity based defense has a number of advantages and disadvantages that are pretty unique. First of all, the energy draw is enormous. Very disproportionate with offensive systems. Unless you have a stupid amount of tech that translates to Honorverse space magic, it isn't cost effective to use it against anything your other countermeasures can deal with. But you can't chip them to death like you see with most shielding systems various properties use. You either have enough power to get through, or you wait for them them to run out of juice.\n\nIf your ship is made out of normal matter, then unless it is the size of the Death Star, you can't stop a 2 terrawatt Xray laser with a 20 meter diameter mirror at 1 light second. It will cut through your ship like it is made out of paper. Your best defense is extreme range, speed, and acceleration. Stay in a position where light speed lag makes targeting impossible and use high speed missiles to engage the enemy at range. If you have to get within a light second to finish the enemy off, do it only after you run out of missiles.\n\nAs for gravity deflection, all the other guy has to do is aim at an angle that will cause the deflected beam to hit your ship. The only true defense is not getting hit in the first place.\n\nGravity deflection really is just shields by another name since that's precisely how Brakiri Gravitic Shielding works in Babylon 5. Hell, Trek shields are graviton-based.\n\nMy best suggestion is to simply accept that without magic energy shields space-going warships will have to rely on speed and ECM for survival and not try to tank hits from various weapons at all. Make your warships obscenely fast, hilariously over-gunned, ridiculously sensor-studded, and hideously intelligent. Space-going bolos without the armor.Gravity deflection really is just shields by another name since that's precisely how Brakiri Gravitic Shielding works in Babylon 5.

With a 10,000km baseline, it's easy to detect incoming threats and put out enough light to be a reliable point-defense. Probably more effective than deca-km size asteroids traditional energy shields. (along with using some other tech like cloaking, high mobility, thermal superconductors, etc to try and deal with energy weapons traditional energy shields.

Main advantage in-universe is that gravitics are a hyperspace effect that propagates at FTL and can reach the target far faster than any other method available, although it has the downside of being easily disruptable. (gravitics being an in-universe misnomer/layman's term for configurable volumetric force fields, since whenever people hear that they think of generic energy shields rather than an area where everything inside a certain volume has a force exerted on it in a specific direction, and 'gravitics' gives a good intuitive feel for what their effects are despite having nothing at all to do with actual gravity. It fits the technology better than tractor beam or repulsor in my opinion at least. )You could get power from it that way, but really not that much. It would be simpler to use the NaK to heat water and have the steam spin turbines if you are going to try to get power this way (which is one of the current uses for for the stuff) and you'd probably get more power back. The main purpose of it though should be as a coolant that distributes heat over a large area of the ship that can be readily dissapated... any power you get out of it is a side benefit."}

Or, see if you can get a Titan on loan from one of your buddies, and scout that thing right in the middle of his army. You might be a little gimmick heavy if you do that, though. Just the Baneblade, showing up to hammer at a flank, would be a good hammer and anvil with the rest of your forces. That, plus Deathstrikes, would at least give you a nice large killcount.\n\nYeah, that's what I was afraid of, and why I mentioned drop pods in the second post. Reserves-based armies are a pain in the rump. The best thing I can think of for them is either plenty of plasma-Russes or a couple tooled-up Vultures. Actually, would a squad or two of Valkeries do the job? Or would the SMs just be able to field too many marines for the lascannons to gun them down? I'm not too familiar with that, I usually don't go up against SMs with loads of drop pods.\n\nArtilery's no good if the enemy can just drop-deploy right on top of you. But, if you're fighting an army that isn't drop-oriented, then you can moonscape 'em pretty good with a Deathstrike or two.\n\nIt's only going to have a shoe-box sized hole if he's not running them in Drop Pods, which is the only way to actually run a Battle Company in Apoc. There's too much ordnance, too much 'D' weaponry being thrown around to make it worthwhile to put them in Rhinos. Drop Pods let you get closer, double-tap the footsloggers, and provide 106 Marines as a distraction while the heavy-hitters on your team get set to rock and roll.\n\nFoul traitors! How dare you turn the Emperor's most blessed gifts against... psshahahahaha, oh man. Yeah, I kinda twigged to that when you asked about the SM Battle Company. Just make sure that Deathstrikes are codex-legal for L&D armies. Also, they're freakin' expensive. 1 Deathstrike is $60, I'm pretty sure, and if you really wanna mop the floor, you're gonna want 2 or 3 of 'em.\n\nOr, one Deathstrike and a couple of Basalisks. Manticores are iffy, they eat blobs but SM's are hardier stuff. I'd recommend you have a ton of blob guard out front to soak bullets while the artillery gets cocked and ready in the back row.\n\nAlso, watch out for deep strikes. If he's smart, he'll try to land a drop pod right on top of your artillery park, or sneak some Termies in. Bring along an Officer of the Fleet, and you can make him re-roll which side of the board he brings his guys in from. Not sure what to do about drop pods, though. Bottom line, if you're going heavy artillery, make it a surprise. Pay that extra 20 or so points for camo netting, unless you have Fantastic Obscuring Cover. Otherwise he's going to longrange you with a Conversion Beam or something. (Also, if you really wanna troll, bring along a Master of Ordinance. One more mini-basalisk will only help, and it's Apocalypse so you won't notice the points. Hopefully.)\n\nOne awesome thing about Apocalypse games is that the models are usually crammed in on top of each other on a small board. If you know he's only got about 5ft by 3ft or less to deploy in, then bring a squad or two of Leeman Russ Executioners, your usual dudes, and 2 Deathstrikes. If Tzeench is with you, you'll roll well and wipe out 2 big ole pieplates worth of his dudes, then follow it up infantry backed with armor.\n\nA question. I've seen Heldrakes used to great effect on SMs at my FLGS. Have you tried them?\n\nDude, it's an 8in-12in pieplate of death that ignores cover saves by default. It's AP 1. It's gonna cremate all those Termies and footslogging Space Marines, and it deals its full strength of 10 to anything inside that huge pieplate. Unless you really screw up on the scatter roll, you're gonna wipe out their command squad and evaporate most of their heavies. It's mainly a psychological tool, like Sly Marbo. The enemy has to space out his guys massively to avoid offering up a juicy target for your Chimera-portable ICBM, which means they can't offer as much covering fire for one another as they should.\n\nIf the dice are with you and you can chuck it on turn 2, then it's like an I-WIN button. That Battle Company is gonna have a shoebox-shaped hole in the middle of it. If not, and you can't haul it out till turn 6, then you can still atomize whatever's been annoying you. In my experience, a couple of Basilisks are better, just chuck ammo downrange and moonscape 'em. Still, Deathstrike is a great way of scaring the tar out of the opposition.\n\nPewter is a bit much to ask of Hasbro, but praise the Emperor and pass the Promethium, for the Death Korps of Krieg are lookin' good. I'm talking about Forgeworld resin, not the poor models who look like they lost their Gellar Field on their trip through the warp. If Forge World made a Pinkie Pie model, I would frickin' have her crewing the Basilisk.\n\nStrike that. She's a Deathstrike kinda girl. T-Minus five minutes to PARTY HARD! And counting."}

Training and good equipment will make any man worth so much more. The more your troops survive the more experience they carry on with them, and can impart to others. So in essence I've always felt armies like Cadians or whatever were... short sighted, and lacking personality. Not to say I don't like the list, dont get me wrong.\n\nThat were Elysian come in. High tech elite soldiers with air power. I can no longer wait for FW to do their thing, because they are company first and not hobbyist second, they are out to make money. Plus whatever they put out new, still dont think they'd match my idea of what elysian are like. Like jet packs, why aren't their jetpacks in their friggin army list? (I would go as far as to say why are there even jet packs general rule, when only tau have the rules, but whatever). Jetpacks just seem like a no brainer to me for elysians. plus, why would they have commissars?! they are elite after all, and shooting your own elite soldiers that you've spent a lot of money to train it just... stupid! counterproductive!\n\nEven more so, none of the current list shout 'elite' to me. Especially the Taros Campaign. Looked more like cut and paste job to me. The D99 regiment get closer but the point cost is RIDICULOUS for these guys, hence no one uses them (often, cant say always).\n\nSo I want to make my own. I need your help though, I only got fluff from the imperial army books. is there more out there? don't care if its fan fluff either i can throw that in as well.\n\nHere's the general idea of what I am going do for the army list, which i want to flesh out. Help me refine it, maybe suggest units I should add, what I should take away, or what should be replace with a more rational unit."}
{"text": "Armor Booster\n\nFrom ArcenWiki\n\nStrong fighter in its own right, it also gives a 2x armor rating bonus to nearby ships on your team. The Armor Boost Calculation gives exact numbers but in-game the ships being boosted will have thin yellow lines connecting the Armor Booster and the ship being boosted.\n\nHow to use in your fleet\n\nArmor boosters are effective survival multipliers, and give players a larger advantage in long-running battles versus the AI. The actual armor mechanic in 5.02x is a flat reduction in damage, so armor-boosters shine most against enemies with weak individual attacks (admittedly not that many). Note that the maximum reduction in damage is 80%, so the player cannot create invincible armies. Note that each booster can only support a certain number of ships in its range.\n\nBeing slow, the best use a lazy player will get is to utilise group-move until actual engagement happens, or pair armour boosters with vessels of similar speed. Defensive equivalent to Munitions Boosters.\n\nHow to counter when in the AI fleet\n\nIn the current version 5.026, armor has only a small affect on general gameplay. Armor boosters will enhance the survival of all enemy ships by a small percentage, but is itself very weak in damage. They only become significant problems when combined with Armor Ships, Space Tanks, and other such crafts explicitly emphasising armor protection (1500+) - in these cases it is prudent to down them first.\n\nThis forum thread is a 5.02x discussion on armor mechanics and useful for further perusal."}
{"text": "I've programatically changed Tbullets according to the speed of the particular bullet. Essentially, I've set a maximum OOS damage of 17% of the IS damage, while also maintaining a minimum OOS damage of 10% of the IS damage.\n\nFrom there I map the available weapons to that range, according to their bullet speed. Outlying bullets (anything faster than an XRM PAC bullet -> 1400 m/s, or slower than an XRM PSP bullet -> 480 m/s) were ignored for this mapping and instead directly assigned to the maximum and minimum values (i.e. PACs, IREs, etc do 17% of their IS damage OOS, while PSP, Mining Drills, etc do 10% of their IS damage OOS). For the remaining bullets there is a linear map of speed to OOS damage percentage (for every 1 m/s faster the bullet moves, the OOS damage is increased by a certain percentage, starting at 10% and maxing at 17%).\n\nThis should be applied as a false patch _AFTER_ XRM. Let me be clear, just as with my assymetric warfare XRM plugin (  ), I don't really intend to support this--keeping up with Paul is simply not sustainable given my RL obligations. this is merely for my own uses and I've made it public in case Paul finds it useful or so that others can build on it if they so chose.\n\nI've run a few tests, though testing has been by no means exhaustive. To me, OOS combat feels about right now, but I'm sure there are some cases that still need work. I've also only done my tests actually observing fights in the map--timings change when not actually looking and so these values may not yet be optimal. Still, I'm pretty happy with it, so far...3 Scimitars still lose to a pirate Katana, but it's actually a very close, and protracted battle where shield recharge counts, but doesnt dominate and the Katana ends at 75% hull, instead of never dropping below 95% shields. A 4th scimi and the Katana loses.\n\nThe resultant weapon OOS/IS ratios are as such:\n\nThe first item is the Bullet_ID\nSecond item is the Bullet speed (in engine units)\nthird item is the OOS/IS damage ratio (IRE, PAC, etc vary a little from 17% due to rounding)I found that the really slow projectiles needed a much larger change in percentage than the faster projectiles. Looking at your list, your PPC and PSP are very similar. That will make Terran capitals much more powerful. There needs to be a bigger percentage difference between those two. Currently in the XRM i have PPC at 10% and PSP at 7.5%. Ive currently got the PPC at 20% and PSP at 15% although i think these values are a little too high.\n\nPPC is honestly not much faster than the PSP--it's only only 20 m/s, or 4%, faster than the PSP.\n\nCompare an FPD to an EMPC, where the difference is closer to a 42% (630 vs 900) speed difference, or an EMPC vs a HEPT with a 22% bullet speed difference (900 vs1100) but the OOS/IS damage ratios in XRM for these weapons are constant at 10%. Why is a 4% difference enough to call PSPs unbalanced, but a 42% difference overlooked?\n\nIf PPC/PSP are unbalanced, I would suggest that it's not in their hit percentages. The real issue is that the Terran ships are simply better than their Argon counterparts, though they're much more restrictive in loadouts and generally more expensive, and so _should_ win. The proper balance point for a generalist vs a by-design-top-tier is numbers, not artificial gimping.\n\nIf you're worried about the Argon losing, Increase the size of their defensive jobsTC Plots, for now anyway, isn't going to work with XRM, unless you want to open the cat/dat up and pull out the conversations.xml (at least) and see what it does that way. I have been through it today, and it doesn't look (at first blush) like it would be too much fun to try and make it workSo I just ran that test using my TBullets above.\n\nI spawned both ships with the cheat menu, owned by me initially, 30km from each other. I hand outfitted them both with max tunings, shields, and the most powerful weapon available in each bank and set their turrets to attack enemies. I then changed ownership of the titan to Race 1 (which is hostile to me and non one else thanks to phanon corp) and ordered the Osaka to attack it. As soon as either one fired the first shot (the Titan, incidentally) I started a stopwatch:\n\nSo, you're right, there are issues in OOS, but I think you've mis-identified them. It's not that the Osaka is doing too much damage (it actually takes longer to kill the Titan OOS than it does IS), rather it's that the Titan is doing too little. This seems to be some evidence that the base OOS damage values are still too low and shield recharge is dominating--keeping the Titan from breaking the Osaka's shields.\n\nNow, of course this could be used to support your position that the PSP should do relatively less damage to the PPC (since thats just the inverse of what I'm suggesting, which is having the PPC do more damage), which I'm fine with. However, it also demonstrates that both should have their damage increased even further from even the boost I gave them above.\n\nWith the evidence at hand, in the form of Alkeena's tests, and Paul's statements of current damage model...\n\nI'm inclined to agree with Alkeena, at least in part.\n\nObserving the exchange, I would suggest increasing the overall damage values, while retaining the mild \"nerf\", as it were, to PSPs to compensate for the manner in which OOS is calculated. It seems to be very realistic, that with the OOS damage values set too low, it is itself influencing the outcome unduly as a result of shield regeneration.\n\nAs for the \"length\" of OOS battles, aside from affecting the ability of the player to arrive and attempt to influence the outcome, I do not see the point of dragging out OOS battles. If the player is concerned about participating in a particular potential battle, then he should be there... If he's not... Then... It's just the simple logistics that he's too far away to get there in time. I don't see what relevance the \"length\" of the battle persay has on the accuracy of the results. If it's a 30 sec battle IS, it ideally should only last 30 sec OOS, as long as the end result is relatively accurate.\n\nRealistically, a perfect solution to this issue will never be found, due to the manner in which OOS is calculated and the variable nature of ship load outs. If ships were hard set with certain weapons, a viable formula could be reasonably achieved. As it is, no matter what settings you choose, there will always be combinations/flukes that \"win\" when they shouldn't. You can only ever hope for the philosophy driving most of X decisions, namely, \"it's good enough... most the time\"\n\n-edit\n\nOn an unrelated note:\n\nI noticed that the Morrigu, which is now a light carrier design capable of docking 15 ships:\n\n#1 Indicates in the description it only carries one fighter\n#2 Does not appear to spawn with any fighters.\n\nIn general the OOS damage values need to be increased. My own testing of 50% was only as long as I was able, and that was only a few hours. I'll probably reduce that number later, but so far, battles seem a bit more 'realistic' for when I'm IS and actually watching"}

It gives you damage resistance, which means you take less damage. Coupled with 100 weapon power, this means you can usually kill your enemies before they can deal any significant damage back to you. At Levels 1-20, most ships can only have one Emergency Power to Shields. That means that you will be protected for about 30 seconds, and unprotected for 30 seconds (assuming you managed to max the skill). At Levels 11+ with a Cruiser or Level 21+ with any other ship, you can have Emergency Power twice. This will give you round-the-time protection. While you don't have two, just remember to have he skill ready before you enter the next combat.\n\nDo you have consoles equipped? Are you using your Bridge officer abilities during fights? These tow things I wasn't aware of when i first started and I was dying far to often. Also remember to use your arrow keys during space combat they control your shields. I run my weapons on full with shields next. and I run at 35% throttle when fighting for maneuverability. You may already know this. But It was like discovering plutonium for the first time for me."}
{"text": "'s a shame that the video is better then alot of the content in the game right now. I hope that there's some Polish to the Game before F2P that adds more \"Remastering\" to Eposide missions to improve them.\n\n\"The developers found that players didn't really like paying for content\"\n\nI think you'll generally find players have no problem paying for good content. It's bad/lacking/no content they begrudge shelling out for.\n\n\"it's possible for players to hit the level cap and get the best gear inside of a single day\"\n\nThat's a bit of an exaggeration, isn't it? Surely. I'm two years in (off and on) and happily plodding along at Lt. Cmdr.\n\nIts not an exaggeration LOL. If you look at players who got so bored but loved star trek so much they stayed around for a long time and kept buying character slots there are a lot of accounts out there that have 10-50 VA/LG's. Is only difference between the factions is that the federation side's content is more from the end of commander to VA. Where as the KDF sides is more of from Lt to Captain. It's all about how you grind each faction out you can casually play a few hours a day and be a VA or LG within a week thats what they are talking about and when you hit that rank you pretty much have enough data samples to craft out the best gear in the game do 3 STF's and you got nothing to do on that character after that.\n\nEdit: [snip] I was corrected by another forum member and found I was incorrect in what Dstahl had previously said.\n\n2) \"The developers found that players didn't really like paying for content, so for Star Trek Online Cryptic is taking a very different approach.\"\n\nWith respect, this is an unfortuante conclusion to come to considering many developers successfuly sell DLC in addition to their games. The simple fact is, if it is worth the buy, they will buy the content. If it is not, they will not.\n\nI propose that we bury the term \"Content\" here once and for all and replace it with a new term that might be more clear: STORYLINE MISSIONS\nPlayers want missions. If it is worth it, they will buy even more missions, if not, they will not."}

You'll love care and bears, you'll adapt to society better. Work brings mind in order. People may only volunteer to enter corfac to repay debts to society. Otherwise they never get sec status back.\n\nThat is essentially the same as running missions or killing NPC pirates to lift sec status. The issue is that clever players have figured out how to raise their sec status quicker than CCP originally intended for it to rise.\n\nIMO, outlaws (-5 sec & lower) should be freely pod-killable with no repercussions from Concord. While this won't \"fix the problem\", the constant stream of high-ISK-value clone losses and/or SP losses might discourage the behavior... assuming one of us \"carebears\" has the balls to lock & shoot a pod.\n\nI thought anyone -5 and below was pod-killable without concord intervention, or has this changed?\n\nPosted - 2011.12.17 01:44:00 -\n[45] - Quote\nMy idea is that suicide ganks on NPC corp characters should grant a significantly lower sec status hit than suicide ganks on player corp members. Mining while in an NPC corp makes you immune to wardecs, the 11% tax doesn't apply to you - NPC corps should not be \"shelters.\"\n\nI honestly don't understand why this is such a debate... It's not as if there are massive gank squadrons flying around ganking every hulk or freighter on undock. We are all playing the same game right?! Every ship I undock I know is at risk of being lost.\n\nGood point. But it does bring up the question is it normal gameplay or just CCP sanctioned griefing?\n\nThe fact that it is CCP santioned means it is not griefing, and thus it is normal gameplay.\n\nGenerals4 wrote:After reading the thread on why people suicide gank, the obvious answer...\"because they can\"...doesnt really address the question.\n\nApparently there are advantages and disadvantages involved in doing so.\n\nThe question here is, currently with present day EVE mechanics, do the advantages outweigh the disadvantages? And if so how can it be better balanced so as to discourage it.\n\nYour thoughts/ideas?\n\nSo, just in case you were really looking for an answer, here goes:\n\nThere are a few key groups of players that suicide gank and they are focused around various ideologies; here's a quick breakdown of what I think those are, and an in depth review of the most important ones:\n\n[in no particular order of importance]\n\n1. Players who do it for profit. Pirates essentially. 2. Players who do it for \"the lulz\". Because they can. 3. Players who are attempting to control resources with no other tool to do so. (killing NPC Corp miners in high sec ice belts for example) 4. Players who are trying to disrupt RMT and botting operations.\n\nHmm, that was a lot shorter than I thought.\n\nLet's address the most trivial reasons first (in order of magnitude/importance, least to greatest): Players who do it for fun- enough said. Some players just like to annoy other players \"because they can\". Players who attempt to disrupt RMT operations. Do they really think they're changing anything on a larger scale? I doubt it. Players who are attempting to control resources with no other recourse- this is the first \"real\" reason here, but it's still less important overall than the best/final reason: PLAYER PROFIT.\n\nSome more detail on why players suicide gank for profit:\n\nBasically, it's CCP's fault that suicide ganking is as prevalent as it is. CCP has gone to *great* lengths to deter suicide ganking, with little real effect, and indeed it has only continued to grow in popularity. The reason why is simple: CCP is doing a terrible job of making \"carebear\" wealth accessible to PVP centric players.\n\nPlayers, and specifically pirates, always go where the money is. \"Back in the day\", there was little suicide ganking (I can remember chasing Iteron Vs fitted with Local Expanders worth over a hundred million ISK in expanders alone lol!). The reason being is because the vast majority of the wealth was in 0.0 and before Warp To Zero (WTZ) was implemented, there was plenty of opportunity to attack ships while traveling. Oh, did I mention stupidity like Jump Bridges and Jump Freighters didn't exist either? If you wanted to haul massive amounts of resources anywhere you had to engage in huge freighter ops that took a lot of coordination and involved a lot of risk. Good times. Then CCP introduced WTZ and further streamlined (read: removed all need for) logistics.\n\nAll that the above changes managed to do was reduce the window of opportunity for players (and pirates in particular) to access other player's wealth via PVP. Currently, the only reasonably reliable way to do so now is through suicide ganking in high sec space. The killers will go where the money is. Since CCP insists on allowing all the hyper rich carebears to live out their entire existence in high sec, the hunters have to adapt. And adapt they have.\n\nCCP has *REPEATEDLY* nerfed the process by doing everything from decreasing Concord response times to adding in stupid pop-up windows to annoy and deter would-be high sec pirates. Clearly it hasn't worked.\n\nWant to actually decrease suicide ganking? Push the same ultra-concentrated wealth into an area where it's more readily accessible by PVP players and you'll see a rapid decrease in the number of suicide ganks. Otherwise, it will only continue to escalate.I'm a pirate in a pirate's body-Death is nothing, but to live defeated and inglorious is to die dailyVery well explained. Pitty that not a single bear will read it with an open mind because bad people are bad and how dare they play one of the pillar roles in this game.\n\nTo me high sec suiciding for profit is the truest form of piracy there is. Plundering the shipping lanes and all that.\n\nAnd suiciding random people is just damn fun when you can't be arsed playing long or can't make time. Or simply can't be arsed with the tedium in every other awsum, honorable form of PvP.\n\nAll that just doesn't fit into the little closed minds that just want to do their grind and expect everyone to act like little npcs and any act of interference with their game is griefing.\n\nOnto the other OP point, cons of suicide ganking...listening to dumb people explaining why it \"should be removed\" and even dumber people that go out of their way to call high sec pirates cowards. It can't be that they just do the job they want and don't give a crap about what YOUR ideals are.\n\n... a severe secloss after shooting a ship that got CONCORDed, because the bounty pod isn't free to shoot.\n\nIn my thread, where i asked to make pods with GCC legal targets, CCP SoundWave approved of that and wrote he will bring this into the game. It's not much of a change, but it helps people like me big time and it makes sense, too.\n\nSadly, there's no \"when\" to that, so i have to keep seccing up every time i shoot a pod with a high bounty that's not flashy ...Inappropriate signature removed.

It's merely a use of mechanics to make it harder to be griefed. Just like using aggression mechanics in a dodgy way is a mean to make griefing easier. What bugs me is that using mechanics in dodgy ways to increase griefing is right while the opposite is somehow a \"Gamebreaking exploit\". And sure if CCP classifies it as an exploit than it is , but seeing as how the dec shield lost that status it isn't anymore and the whining is just as justified as the whining about any pro-griefing use of certain mechanics. It doesn't mean the mechanics cannot be changed in a way or an other but all the whining sometimes comes off as pathetic in my opinion.-Death is nothing, but to live defeated and inglorious is to die daily"}

{"text": "I've got some rep with mercs guild and now they are offering me a 'destroy capital' missions.\n\nI've tried to complete this kind mission on fully fitted Nexus (most expensive equipment and upgrades) for many times using different missiles/torpedo variations and I don't get how to kill that ship. Friendly assistants get owned too fast, then capital owes me.\n\nIt depend what kind of Capital ship it is. Pegasi are probably the easiest of the Capital Ships, because it doesn't bristle with guns, But since it has the highest level of engine upgrades of any ship, its shields recharge very quickly.\n\nIf it's a Nexus, don't try to get very close to them. outfit your side turrets with the longest range weapon possible, So you can circle around them and bombard them from afar, because they're too slow to get anywhere near you. Once one side is down on shields, divert all shield power to the front and afterburn your way towards it and dive bomb it with torpedoes. Rinse, repeat until nothing is left.\n\nDon't really bother with the fighter escort. Usually the friendlies will go for them first. also, get a wingman before your encounter, and try to get an expensive one so that they have good gear. Then you get one more meatshield assistant that you can also order around so that it doesn't try to take on the Capital Ship by itself. _________________ I eat syrofoam cups.\n\nI just learned something.... if you fight a Pegasus, and you are flying a Pegasus, and you have an AI controlled rear turret with a fully boosted Tachyon Cannon, you can hit afterburner and maintain a distance that allows your turret to hit him but leaves you out of his range. Then just run like crazy in a straight line, and eventually he will blow.\n\nI did take down a Retro Nexus using the technique I posted above, except I did it in a Pegasus instead of a Nexus, using the rear turret instead of the side turret. It took over an hour of intense micromanagement, with many, many coffee breaks, just to get it's shields down. I then dive bombed it with dual torpedoes.\n\nI attempted to try to take a Pegasus down in a Ulysses. I was going pretty well before it turned it's front towards me. You can guess what happened next.\n\nAnd I swore I changed my shield levels to the front. If not, we should be able to.\n\nI don't believe it, but I managed to down a capital ship for the first time with my humble Galaxy. Was armed with neutron guns in the fore and aft, had an Orion-piloting wingman and four mercs with me. For some reason I just kept at it, firing at it even though I'd reloaded a bunch of times already and was pretty sure I'd lose.\n\nI kept pummeling it with EMP torpedoes and neutron blasts as a few of the mercs exploded around me and... suddenly I knocked out its power supply and was aboard. A few dead pirates later and I could safely blow the ship up! Granted it was just a Pegasus, but I have to say that was pretty rewarding to finally take one down!\n\nAlso, I didn't know their cargo holds were so big; I got quite a haul afterward.\n\nDon't mean to brag or anything, but here's a 2 min. movie of me taking out a Pegasus, without the help of any hunters, and with out any damage to my ship. This is definitely the most cowardly way to do it, but it works about 40-50 % of the time. It's the \"Flyboy maneuver\"\n\nThere's an idea. You get a limb blown off, you get a robotic replacement for cheap, but it's not as good as a vat grown body part clone...\n\nAfter 600 years of development cybernetic limbs should be at least as good as natural... but cheaper artificial replacement shouldn't be fixed in Autodoc. It'll require some \"workshop\", CyberHospital or at least nanobots (like for ship's guns; with \"patched\" status - less efficiency). _________________ Genuine Lifelike IndividualJournalists are looking for sensations usual. Some \"scientists\" in XIX century thought that amount of horses in cities should be limited in future otherwise we'll be walking in horse s**t because \"cleaning services\" can't work fast enough... _________________ Genuine Lifelike Individual\n\nAgain, science fiction is a relative thing... I'm not sure I get your continued assurance that things follow through. Why is everyone speaking cigar-chomping English? Why does everyone wear slightly changed airforce garb? Why is everything named after 20th century stuff, and people are still referencing World War II like it was yesterday?\n\nIt's because we're not in the future, and we don't know how things will go.\n\nSo, this is a gameplay idea, not a magical prediction sphere. This is a game with Plutonium in asteroids, for heaven's sake.\n\nThe robo limb is the cheap replacement, left over from when they used them. Now they use vat-grown stuff, but because people can't afford it, they're often given the cheap, old replacements instead until they can afford it. See? Not so hard to come up with a reason, but the reasons don't matter. It's a gameplay idea."}
{"text": "dear people who are awesome enough to code automatic influence/sov maps:\n\ncould you set one up so that instead of counting outposts/stations/sov, it primarly counts mineral moons? the weighing would be dynamic to reflect the jita profit possible from that moon, with some afterthoughts to outposts/sov.\n\ni realize that this will have very little resemblance to what appears on the \"Sovereignty\" line next to the system name in EVE proper, and will not be 100% accurate since there are other methods of massive isk income, but i think it would be a more accurate representation of who really runs bartertown.\n\nIt's only accurate based on the source of the moon scans, but it is pretty damn close when compared to my scan results for a few regions. It is not complete, but you can tell that from the data coverage column.\n\nI have to say I like this idea, but it's simply not practical from a development standpoint.\n\nThe fact that CCP provides no API for applications to find out: 1) Which moons have which minerals in them. 2) Average market prices on things (eve-central kind of does this, but CCP really needs to release their own API for it; eve-central kind of sucks tbqfh). 3) Who has a tower anchored on each moon (and whether or not they actually have a moon miner anchored & onlined).\n\nNot to mention the fact that the amount of profit from moons can vary quite a bit depending on what the person mining it does with it -- sell it straight, simple react it and then sell it, do a full-on complex reaction and then sell it, or go all the way to T2 components or even T2 modules/ships...\n\nHonestly the only way this would be even partly \"possible\" is if all the major alliances reported what moons they owned and their locations, along with how much profit they made off the moons -- and that isn't going to happen, because high end moons are totally-super-sekrit.\n\nI'd be happy for a map that shows the sov of systems, and links them, but does NOT give extra range due to Outposts and such. Some alliance's in 0.0 you can't even SEE their space on the maps, due to them having only one outpost where an adjoining alliance may have 10, and the \"influence\" from the 10 overides the one.\n\nBasically a sov map that shows the actual borders between sov holding entities.\n\nOriginally by:Holy LowlanderI doubt this map is complete tbh ( that is only highend wise)\n\nCache , Cobalt Edge , Curse , Great Wildlands , Outer Passage , Periggen Falls, The spire not having any highend moons at all can't be correct , can it ?\n\nAnd are branch , tenal and tribute really *that* low on highendmoons ?\n\nThe dotlan is hardly reliable when it comes to high-end counts, it's all information compiled from outside sources. I think a good amount of that info comes from leaked info here and there. Places that change hands more often tend to have the more reliable info, as more people know where the high-ends are. Branch, Tenal and Tribute haven't really changed hands that often. I think the closest any of them have come to being in any real danger was the MAX campaign, and I believe that only just barely scratched into Tribute before it fizzled. Places like Deklein, Cloud Ring, and most of the central southern regions have changed hands a good number of times, so that info is better known.\n\ni missed \"Joshua Foiritain\" style map :( it was eye candy.. okay sometimes its favors bob etc but still it was good i'm not saying current ones bad or something but that map ( That Map ) was realy making things easy to see. and there was marks on it for titan lose etc who attacking who, who with who, who agaisnt who,Originally by:Tanx0rEdited by: Tanx0r on 30/08/2009 00:10:48 The EVE API holds dynamic sov info per solarsystem and per constellation only.Edit: typo\n\nto my understanding, you can't. it'd either require a rewrite of the API export to show moon sov (fat chance), or work like the list of all known titans (nightmarish, but possible)\n\nAt least as far as the current influence map is concerned, this is entirely doable. The meat of the code is drawing, it's very easy to rewrite the \"who has sov here\" bits to count moons instead. It's a weekend project, at the longest.\n\nAs others have pointed out, the problems are related to getting the information, not displaying it. I have no way to query who actually owns any given moon - the best I can do is look at sovereignty. I have a similar problem with stations, so I just default to basing it off of who has sov there since it's rare that the sov holder isn't the station holder. For moons, this probably isn't reliable enough.\n\nI also don't have a list of moons. Without a good list (and Dotlan probably isn't good enough) the map probably wouldn't be accurate enough to matter.\n\nThis thread is older than 90 days and has been locked due to inactivity."}
{"text": "Line one is pillage and rapine, line two is quiet life of farming, line three is daring trader to distant empires, line four is stalwart colonist exploring new lands, and line five is for the expedition to go invent Russia.\n\nYeah. Something like this happened - A guy found that he could take a near valueless item that no one ever bought, buy 1 for a billion isk, and suddenly the market price is 1b because no one else has bought one for three months.\n\nThen you insure the ship, get it blown up, and collect 50% of the ships value in ISK.\n\nSo Rifter + \"1b\" junk item that you have a ton of + a buddy with a couple of rail guns = mass money laundering. In this case CCP took all their ill earned isk and congratulated them on being clever, but did not ban them.\n\nWe need to cure aging. Not for the sake of immortality or the good of humanity, but because when we're all seventy and stuck in nursing homes on the moon we're going to want to have LAN parties but we won't be able to stay awake for them.\n\nIt's not so much that we're disorganized as that our style of organization is very different from conventional outfits. When we're being casual gameplay is \"Try to stay in the same hex as the platoon waypoint.\" When things get a bit more srs bznz it's up to whoever is leading ops how they want to order things. That could be forty people playing follow the waypoint or four squads operating semi-independently to achieve an overall goal. While some people who lead ops more often than others there is no set \"leader\" - It's very much a do-ocracy. Anyone is welcome to lead squads, create events, or herd cats and the style and degree of tacticool changes depending on who is cat-herder in chief at the moment.\n\nIt was that bad. Right now it's really, really good, on par with the ScatMAX but with different applications.\n\nBasically - the VS max used to be worthless. The weapons lacked the accuracy to hit anything consistently at even moderate ranges and the damage output was fairly low. Now the weapons are much more accurate, allowing you to lay out accurate fire to at least 20m. The NC MAX can dish out tremendous amounts of alpha strike on anyone foolish enough to get close and that makes them excellent in very tight areas. The VS max has more sustained fire ability, and while you're not going to saw an entire infantry squad down like you can with a ScatMAX you can dominate infantry in close to midrange. VS MAXes are notably much better on the move.\n\nNC Maxes - Death to anything at 3m-15m, including other MAXes, but limited on the move or in the open\n\nVA Maxes - Can take down infantry very effectively at 10-25m and do well in areas where those ranges are common, but limited in extreme close quarters and long range fighting.\n\nClang, Neil Gaiman has funded a few projects, and there are innumerable smaller efforts that never come anywhere close to the massive media blitz that some things get. Didn't Giant in the Playground kickstart the printing of one of their books or something?\n\nI know, right? I've seen my brother turn a game around because he managed to sneak a couple of rangers into a good spot and seize an enemy mortar. It's really not one of those games where the first ten seconds define the whole match.\n\nThat is my brother and his friend. They're beasts, and the community is small enough that people would just drop the game rather than play against them. They weren't cheating - they just used a good understanding of infantry tactics and great teamwork.\n\nFrom what I can remember of his ramblings Vivec seemed to be unfixed in time. He might be dead in the 4th era, but simultaneously quite alive and active in the 2nd, in the sense that he perceives his entire existence as one moment without privileging any particular point in time as the \"Present\". A distinction between \"Life\" and \"Death\" wouldn't mean the same thing to someone who wasn't moving inevitably from one to the other. It'd be a bit more like a circle - There would be a moment before which you could not perceive, and a moment after which you could not perceive, but you wouldn't \"end\" because you're still alive at every other point in your perceptual timeline.\n\nOr.... I could be completely off base. Honestly Vivec's divinity is one of those things that I'm still not really clear on.\n\nI still have trouble accepting that there even are fixed life spans in Nirn. There is so much weirdness in this setting. Time can and does go bonkers on a regular basis, every kind of imaginable magic exists, most diseases and illnesses can be cured instantly by those sufficiently knowledgeable. Hell - IRL death is mostly the result of coming down with a bunch of illnesses at once because your body is too old to deal with them. If you can just throw a Cure Disease on yourself every morning you're not going to succumb to pneumonia any time soon. A sufficiently powerful wizard could create a constant effect restore health and stamina 1pt ring, enchant something else with +str, +fatigue, and +dexterity as a sort of power-assist mobility rig, and be up and going at 120 easily even if they have exactly the same physiology as a real human.\n\nJust having fatigue potions, which presumably reverse the effects of, say, sustained exercise, would be a huge boon to an elderly person - Doing anything is exhausting when you're older. If you could just mix some onions and a grape together, down it, and feel totally refreshed, even more so than when you dragged your tired old bones out of bed in the morning, you'd be able to stay very active and offset many of the diseases and maladies that stem largely from inactivity in old age.\n\nEven peasants can presumably make simple alchemical potions, and people of means would be able to access quite powerful ones on at least an occasional basis.\n\nThat does get into a question - Mechanically you can reverse any kind of physical damage with magic. So with magic could you, say, regenerate lungs damaged by tuberculosis by applying a cure disease effect and a restore endurance spell? Would a combination restore strength, restore dex, and restore endurance repair that was broken, set badly, and healed?\n\nThere seems to be... wildly varied sources on just how much magic is available to common people. In game almost everyone has at least a few spells and martially oriented people - soldiers, bandits, guards - seem to have some degree of magic at least half the time. Some sources depict magic as less common, other sources depict various sorcery as being used by the majority of soldiers in an army on an individual level. Presumably every farmer in the land would want to know a few spells if it could ease the birth of a calf or heal a blighted crop.\n\nEitherway - Even assuming the \"life span\" of a human is the same in Tamriel as on Earth, the availability of magics to counteract disease and many of the debilitating effects of age could allow people to live much, much longer than they do on earth before you even get into extending life-span directly."}
