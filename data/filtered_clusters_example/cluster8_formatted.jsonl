{"text": "Question: Science\n\nWhen pollutants (from cars, factories, etc...) are released into the atmosphere part of their chemical components include nitrogen oxides, hydrocarbons, and sulfur (to name a few). These components react with each other and in the presence of the sun a potent mix of ozone and other chemicals are created. This is caused photochemical smog. Acid raid occurs when rain mixes with these photochemicals and are transported to earth via the rain. When combined with rain the oxides often form nitric or sulfuric acide which is highly toxic and completely corrosive.\n\nJust write it out without crsoneing anything.

It affects the body's ability to absorb oxygen and deliver it to the organs and tissues. Health effects include fatigue, headaches and slowed reflexes. High exposures can cause unconsciousness and death. The brain and heart are the organs most sensitive to carbon monoxide exposure. Other symptoms of overexposure may include: dizziness, weakness, nausea, confusion, chest pain, and abnormal heart rhythms. Exposure to CO is particularly dangerous for those with heart and respiratory conditions, pregnant women, fetuses, and anemic individuals."}

You're going to have to multiply it by a period of time and divide it by some mass to achieve the correct dimensions. Fortunately, we can make a few measurements and come up with these quantities.\n\nI'll start with the mass, since it's the hardest to compute. In 1 hr, you produce 1200 mg of Ozone. In order to find ppm, I need to know the mass of the air into which these 1200 mg of Ozone will be spread. This is where the measurements come in. Let's say the room is 4x5x2.5=50 m3. The mass of the air in the room will be it's Volume x Density = 50 m3 X 1.25 g/l x 1000 l/m3 x 1000 mg/g = 62,500,000 mg.\n\nIf you divide the mass of the ozone by the mass of the air, you'll get the mass fraction of ozone. Multiply that number by 1 million, and you've got ppm/hr: 1200/62,500,000*1,000,000=19.2 ppm/hr.\n\nNow all you've got to do is multiply that number by the time you run the machine and you've got ppm.

Why is the ozone layer important to our\nhealth? What is the danger of less ozone in the upper atmosphere? All questions\nanswered below!\n\ne.g. dichlorodifluoromethane\nhas the formula CCl2F2 (shown in right\ndiagram).\n\nThey are very useful low boiling\norganic liquids or gases, until recently, extensively used in refrigerators and\naerosol sprays e.g. repellents.\n\nThey are\nrelatively\nunreactive, non-toxic and have low flammability, so in many ways they\nare 'ideal' for the job they do.\n\nHowever it is their\nchemical stability in the environment that eventually causes the ozone\nproblem but first we need to look at how ozone is formed and\ndestroyed in a 'natural cycle'. This presumably has been in\nbalance for millions of years and explains the uv ozone protection in\nthe upper atmosphere.\n\nOzone is formed in the\nstratosphere by free radical reactions.\n\n'ordinary' stable\noxygen\nO2 (dioxygen) is split (dissociates) into two\nby high energy ultraviolet radiation (uv photon energy\n'wave packets) into two oxygen atoms (which are themselves\nradicals) and then a 'free' oxygen atom combines with an oxygen\nmolecule to form ozone (trioxygen).\n\nO2 +\nuv ==>\n2O. then O.\n+ O2==> O3\n\nThe ozone is a highly\nreactive and unstable molecule and decomposes into dioxygen when hit\nby other uv light photons.

(note\nthe C-Cl bond is weaker than the C-F bond and breaks more easily)\n\nThe\nformation\nof chlorine atom radicals is the root of the problem because\nthey readily react with ozone and change it back to much more stable\nordinary oxygen.\n\nThe two\nreactions above involving chlorine atoms are known as a catalytic\ncycle because the chlorine atoms from CFC's etc. act as a\ncatalyst in the destruction of ozone.\n\nTherefore\nmany\ncountries are banning the use of CFCs, but not all despite\nthe fact that scientists predict it will take many years for the\ndepleted ozone layer to return to its 'original' O3\nconcentration and alternatives to CFC's are already being marketed.\n\nBUT at least the\nozone layer is recovering thanks to some world-wide co-operation\nand the work of chemists in developing less environmentally\nharmful alternatives.\n\nAlternatives to\nCFCs\n\nThe idea is to use\nreplacement compounds that are less harmful to the ozone layer.\n\nThe molecules listed\nbelow contain C-H bonds and are broken down in the lower\ntroposphere before they reach the ozone layer in the\nstratosphere.\n\nHydrochlorofluorohydrocarbons (HCFCs)\n\ne.g. CH3CFCl2\n1,1-dichloro-1-fluoroethane\n\nHydrofluorocarbons (HFCs)\n\ne.g. CH2FCF3\n1,1,1,4-tetrafluoroethane\n\nAlkanes\n\ne.g. butane\nCH3CH2CH2CH3\n\nbut they are\nflammable!\n\nHowever, all of\nthese molecules are greenhouse gases and will contribute to\nglobal warming!"}

{"text": "arbon monoxide (CO) is a toxic gas that is invisible, odorless, colorless, non-irritating, and tasteless. CO is a by-product of in-\n\ncomplete combustion of carbon-containing materials. With CO being as old as fire itself, one can only imagine the number of cases of CO poisoning that would have been seen in the emergency de- partment at \"Homo Erectus Community Hospital\" had it existed 700 to 800 thousand years ago when the cave dwelling Peking Man began using fire for cooking and cave warming! Ironically, CO is manufactured in the body as a result of the\n\nbreakdown of hemoglobin. Consequently, normal people may have a COHb concentration of 0.5% in their blood. Smokers often have COHb levels of 10% or higher.\n\nHistorical Background Not until coal was used as a domestic fuel did CO poisoning\n\nbecome a recognized medical problem. Homes and industry re- lied on gas from coal and oil for heating and lighting. Edgar Allen Poe (1809-1849) unwittingly wrote about his symptoms of CO poisoning from gas lighting in many of his short stories. In his fit- tingly titled story, \"Loss of Breath,\" Poe wrote, \"The sensations of my illness were much like those of a man upon the gallows: I heard my heart beating with violence - the veins in my hands and wrists were swelling to nearly bursting \u2013 my temple throbbed tem- pestuously - and I felt my eyes were starting from my sockets... Confusion crowded upon confusion like a wave upon a wave.\" Poe related numerous other symptoms in his writings. After Poe's death on October 7, 1849, the Baltimore health commissioner listed the cause of death as \"congestion of the brain.\" In 1857, in France, a French physiologist named Claude\n\nBernard carried out an animal experiment and noticed how the animal's venous blood was as cherry red as blood in arterial cir- culation. Still puzzled as to what CO did to kill the animal, Bernard took a sample of arterial blood from a healthy animal, placed this blood beneath a layer of liquid mercury in a test tube containing CO gas. Maintaining an air-tight seal, Bernard shook the tube to achieve contact between the blood and the CO. He then analyzed the gas in the test tube and found it was oxygen- enriched. Bernard concluded that the CO displaced the O2 in the blood and that the CO \"remained fixed in the blood corpuscles,\" causing the demise of the animal.\n\nEpidemiology CO is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality by poi-\n\nsoning in the United States. Because many cases of CO poisoning\n\ngo undetected and unreported, the actual incidence of this poi- soning is unknown. Estimates are that approximately one-third of all cases are undiagnosed because CO poisoning mimics a variety of systemic diseases. Common sources of CO are wood and gas burning fire-\n\nand CO bind reversibly with hemoglobin. These two gases compete for binding with the four hemes in the hemoglobin molecule. However, the magnitude of hemoglobin's affinity for CO is 210 to 240 times greater than for O2. Additionally, the binding of CO to hemoglobin to form carboxyhemoglobin (HbCO) causes conformational changes to hemoglobin's tetrameric structure, thereby increasing the affinity of the re- maining heme groups for O2. In other words, when a CO mol- ecule binds with one of the four hemes on a hemoglobin molecule, the other three hemes cling to O2 more avidly. The result is a leftward shift of the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve, and a compromised tissue O2 delivery. The greater affin- ity of hemoglobin for CO accounts for the fact that only a small amount of inspired CO causes a large COHb level in the blood. For example, inhalation of 0.1% CO produces a COHb level of 10%. Myoglobin is another heme-containing molecule that\n\nbinds avidly with CO. Skeletal and cardiac muscle are ad- versely affected by this binding. Carboxymyoglobin poses a se- rious threat to a CO victim because the myocardium can be severely deprived of oxygenation. The associated cardiac is- chemia can cause lethal dysrythmias. The binding of CO to car- diac myoglobin also has a depressant effect on the heart, producing hypotension. Both of these effects exacerbate the de- creased tissue O2 delivery. Interestingly, CO dissociates from myoglobin much more slowly than CO does from hemoglobin. Consequently, as CO leaves myoglobin, CO re-enters the blood where the COHb level rises again. Outside the vasculature CO binds with cytochrome A3, an enzyme involved in the electron transport chain within the process of oxidative phosphorylation. Oxidative phosphorylation involves the production of ATP from ADP and phosphate by harnessing the energy released as elec- trons are transferred during a series of oxi-"}

{"text": "As this report focuses on improved cookstove adoption, we will operationalize this term for the reader. Adoption in the broadest sense is not an \"either/or\" event. There is a continuum of cookstove practices that relate to consumer actions to reduce IAP. The first step is the acquisition of an improved cookstove. An improved cookstove is a stove that is more fuel efficient and releases fewer emissions than the one previously used. Usually, improved cookstoves are compared to a traditional \"three-stone\" fire, but they also can be compared to something more efficient than that but less efficient than the current improved cookstove. An improved cookstove may use the same kinds of fuel previously used (like wood) or something cleaner, like liquid petroleum gas (LPG). Making a change from one kind of fuel to another is adoption of cleaner fuel. In addition, there are cleaner kitchen practices promoted to reduce indoor air pollution that may be equally beneficial as improved cookstoves.\n\nChimneys can be built and windows can be put in kitchen walls, for example. Some improved cookstoves require changes in cooking behavior to realize their benefits, such as cooking two pots of food simultaneously instead of sequentially. A final issue with cooking practices is the use of multiple fuels/stoves at one time also known as \"stacking\" of fuels/stoves. In many households, traditional stoves are used at the same time as improved cookstoves, or the different stoves may be used for different foods. It is not merely the household acquisition of an improved cookstove, but its correct and sustained use to the relative exclusion of less efficient stoves that is critical to improving health, though any movement toward behaviors that reduce emissions are valued."}

Sometimes, this ozone is called \"good ozone\" because it forms a layer that protects life on earth from the sun's harmful rays. Ground-level ozone can be harmful for your health and the environment.\n\nGround-level ozone forms when pollutants from cars and trucks, power plants, factories and other sources come in contact with each other in heat and sunlight. Factors such as weather conditions and intensity of sunlight also play a part in how ozone is formed. Ground-level ozone is one of the biggest parts of smog, and it is usually worse in the summer months.\n\nMany urban areas tend to have higher levels of ground-level ozone but rural areas have ground-level ozone, too. Wind carries ozone and the pollutants that form it hundreds of miles from their original sources, and rural areas have sources of ozone that contribute to this problem.\n\nAbout Particulate Matter\n\nParticle pollution, or particulate matter, consists of particles that are in the air, including dust, dirt, soot and smoke, and little drops of liquid. Some particles, such as soot or smoke, are large or dark enough to be seen. Other particles are so small that you cannot see them.\n\nParticle pollution can come from primary or secondary sources. A primary source, such as wood stoves or forest fires, lets off particle pollution directly. A secondary source lets off gases that react and form particles. Examples of secondary sources are coal fires and power plants. Particle pollution also comes from motor vehicles, factories, and construction sites. These can be primary or secondary sources. Particle pollution can be a problem at different times of the year, depending on where you live.\n\nParticle pollution includes:\n\ncoarse particles that are between 2.5 and 10 micrometers\n\nfine particles that are between 0.1 micrometers and 2.5 micrometers (also known as PM2.5)\n\nultrafine particles that are smaller than 0.1 micrometers.\n\nParticles bigger than 10 micrometers can irritate your eyes, nose and throat but do not usually reach your lungs. Ten micrometers is about seven times thinner than one human hair.\n\nFine and ultrafine particles are the size of most concern because they are most likely to cause health problems. Their small size allows them to get into the deep part of your lungs and even into your blood."}

{"text": "Air Sampling Mold Tests\n\nAir Sampling\n\nThere are two different ways mold inspectors sample airborne particulates for mold testing. Both are called impact sampling, because in this type of testing, spores collide with a medium and stick to it.\n\nCulturable Air Sampling\n\nIn culturable air sampling, mold spores are sucked by a vacuum pump into the impactor and trapped directly on the nutrient surface in a petri dish. The covered dish is then placed in an incubator at the lab and allowed to sit for a week to ten days. Only the viable mold spores germinate within and grow, often into identifiable colonies.\n\nOne drawback to culturable sampling is that even though there may be many spores of one particular type in an air sample, if they are dead they will not produce any colonies at all, yet the dead spores can still be allergenic. Also, even though they can cause allergy symptoms, most hyphae do not grow into colonies on a petri dish.\n\nAnother problem with culturable sampling is that aerosolized spores often are often part of large clusters. But when a cluster lands in a petri dish, no matter how many spores it contains, the resulting growth will appear to be only a single colony. As a result the sample may underestimate the actual concentration of spores and the exposure to allergens.\n\nCulturable sampling also will not tell you whether the spores contain mycotoxins, because in the petri dish, the fungus may not produce toxins. If you suspect that you have been exposed to mold toxins and you really want to know, hire a professional to collect a bulk sample and send it to a lab for mycotoxin analysis, because petri-dish culturing of mold spore samples alone will not suffice.\n\nMany of the do-it-yourself mold testing kits use nutrient petri dishes. This is called settle-plate testing. A petri dish is left open in a room for an hour or so and is then sent off to a lab for analysis. Unfortunately, there are a number of uncertainties with this method. For example, it's difficult to connect the growth that may occur in the petri dish with the sources of the spores, either indoors or outdoors. Also, the settle-plate test is biased toward larger spores, because they settle out of the air faster than smaller spores do. Yet it is the smaller spores that may be more problematic for sensitized individuals. And unlike impact samplers, which use pumps that can be calibrated for airflow, settle-plate testing cannot provide any information regarding the concentration of spores, so this type of sampling is useless in determining exposure levels.\n\nSpore-trap Sampling\n\nIn spore-trap sampling, air is drawn through a device by a pump and suspended particulates, including both viable and dead spores, as well as hyphae, are trapped on a sticky surface such as tape. The samples can then be stained and examined under a microscope. Spore-trap sampling is usually adequate to determine if there is a mold problem in a building, though any air sampling done indoors, whatever the type, should also include one or two samples of outdoor air for comparison \u2014 as controls, unless it is winter and the ground is frozen in which case there are few spores outdoors."}

{"text": "The health effects of particulate matter in the air can be quite serious.\n\nTHANKS to the volcanic ash cloud that hangs over Europe, my wife cannot come back from her work visit to Europe. We know what volcanic ash can do to the engines of aeroplanes. But do these particles have any impact on our health when we breathe them in?\n\nLet's talk about particles or particulate matter in general, seeing as we have no active volcanoes in Malaysia. (Though we may be affected if a volcano in Indonesia erupts.)\n\nParticulates or fine particles are tiny subsets of solid or liquid materials which are suspended in either a gas (like air) or liquid (like water). When you have particulates suspended in gas, we call it aerosol.\n\nParticulates can either remain solid when suspended, or dissolve in the liquid it is suspended in. Example, salt dissolves in water. But ash will remain as solid in the same water.\n\nParticulates in the air are responsible for causing diseases in the hearts and lungs.\n\nDo these particulates always come from natural disasters like volcanoes?\n\nNo. Particulates can come from natural sources or man-made sources.\n\nNatural sources include volcanoes, forest fires (like with the haze), dust storms, and sand storms. Some even come from vegetation, such as when the wind blows fine pollen from the grass. Some even come from the sea.\n\nBut humans are also responsible for a lot of the particulates in the atmosphere. Burning, for example, spews a lot of particulates into the air. Industrial plants that let out a lot of effusions from their smoke stacks and diesel engines from trucks and cars also contribute.\n\nIt is estimated that 10% of particulate matter in the world's air come from human activities.\n\nWhat types of particulates are there floating in the air? How big are they? Can we see them? Do they block out light?\n\nParticulates are usually classified by size. A particulate can be as large as 10 micrometers or as tiny as below 100 nanometers. The latter are called ultrafine particles.\n\nWe can definitely see them if they blanket out the sky, e.g. the haze, volcanic ash clouds.\n\nThe effects on the climate are very bad. Particulates can affect climate directly by absorbing solar and infrared radiation from the atmosphere. When they absorb too much, a critical point is reached when they start to change from cooling down our atmosphere to heating it.\n\nIndirectly, they cause more condensation of water and increase cloud size.\n\nThe eruption of a Russian volcano, for example, in the early 17th century, caused the Russian famine of 1601 to 1603, leading to two million deaths from starvation.\n\nWhat types of diseases can particulates cause?\n\nThe size of the particulate determines where in our respiratory tract the particle will finally rest, and what type of disease it can cause.\n\nThe larger the particle, the less effect it has on health. Larger particles are filtered by our nose hairs, then by the cilia in our tracheas, But the smaller ones \u2013 less than 10 micrometers \u2013 can penetrate to our bronchi and our alveoli (air sacs) in our lungs.\n\nAnd the really small ones \u2013 less than 2.5 micrometers \u2013 can penetrate into the barrier between the alveoli sacs and blood. These tiny particles can also lead to plaque deposits in our arteries themselves. This process is called artherosclerosis, where our arteries harden with deposits to become inflexible and inelastic, leading to heart attacks and strokes.\n\nIn fact, researchers have found that even short-term exposure to these tiny ultrafine particles can cause significant artherosclerosis.\n\nNow it has been found that really tiny particles of less than 100 nanometers can cross through our cell membranes and be transported into our organs, such as the brain. There are theories that this is one of the causes of Alzheimer's disease.\n\nIt is recorded that particulate pollution is the cause of up to 52,000 deaths per year in the US.\n\nI have heard a lot of bad things about diesel engines. Do they produce particulates?\n\nYes, and unfortunately, the particulate size produced here (called Diesel Particulate Matter) is the in the range of 100 nanometers, one of the smallest, leading to diseases mentioned above.\n\nThe main contaminant here is sulphur dioxide.\n\nNot only that, these particles carry carcinogens, or materials that cause cancer, such as benzopyrene, arsenic, and formaldehyde.\n\nNote that even the shape of the particle can be dangerous. Asbestos particulates are shaped like feathers, and are more dangerous than rounded particulates. They lodge in our lungs and can give rise to asbestosis and the dangerous complication of mesothelioma, a pleural lining cancer.\n\nNote that the diesel exhaust fumes itself can cause irritation to our eyes, nose, throat and lungs, leading to increased asthma attacks.\n\nDr YLM graduated as a medical doctor, and has been writing for many years on various subjects such as medicine, health advice, computers and entertainment.

While nitrogen and oxygen are vertically (at right angles to the Earth's surface) equally distributed, the distribution of ozone varies with height and reaches its maximum amount (concentration) at around 20 km, in the stratosphere. The normal atmosphere reaches up to about 120km above the Earth's surface, and pressure reduces exponentially with height. If one were to take the whole air-mass over a particular area on the Earth's surface and press it so that was all under the same pressure as the air at ground level, then that air would take up a space 8km high. Of these 8km, ozone would make up only 3mm! It is in this way that the amount of ozone in the atmosphere is described. The units are called Dobson units (DU): 300 DU mean 3mm of the air column is made up of ozone. Ozone is a relation of oxygen. It is made of three oxygen atoms (O3)\n,unlike the oxygen we breathe and which plays an important role in the burning process, which is made of two oxygen atoms. Ozone is produced when oxygen (O2) is broken up into its atoms (O) by high-energy solar radiation, of wavelengths below 240 nanometers. (1000000000 nanometer (nm) is the same as one meter.) O3 protects the Earth's surface from harmful sun rays. Ozone absorbs above all radiation from the sun which lies in the UV-B region: (280-315 nm wavelength) and through this absorption is split up again into an oxygen atom and an oxygen molecule.\n\nThe picture shows two ways of looking at the vertical distribution of ozone. The solid line represents the ratio of ozone as a volume. One takes for example one cubic metre of air and compares the number of all the particles within that volume with the number of ozone particles, or molecules. So 1 ppmv (parts per million volume) means 1 ozone molecule in one million air molecules. But, the total number of molecules in that volume reduces with increasing height because of the reduction in air pressure. The volume mixing ratio (VMR) is therefore a relative term, always related to the air. If one wants to talk about the total number of particles at a particular height, one uses the \"particle number density\", or concentration. This tells you how many particles of one sort (like ozone) are in a certain volume, e.g. 1 cubic centimetre. This is shown by the dotted line. The units\nare not shown here though because ozone concentration is only to serve as an illustration. The most ozone (the highest concentration) is found about 20km above the Earth, and between about 15 and 35km lies the ozone layer, with high ozone concentrations. Under and over it are much lower ozone concentrations. The mixing ratio is important to judge where the most ozone is to be found. Because ozone increases compared to air until about 40km height, one can assume that the most ozone is produced at 40km. There, there are 345 DU of ozone. This is a normal value for the ozone layer.\n\nOzone Formation\n\nIllustration: The formation of ozone from oxygen in the stratosphere.\nIllustration Source: IUP Bremen\n\nOxygen atoms are shown in the illustration as blue balls. When atoms are bonded to form moleclues, they are shown overlying one another. Sunlight is symbolised by yellow waves.\n\nOzone is produced in small quantities from oxygen (O2) when the sun shines. The illustration shows in a simplified form what happens in the stratosphere. When very short-wavelength ultra-violet light (< 240 nm) hits an oxygen (O2) molecule, it is split into two single oxygen atoms (O), in a process called photolysis. These very reactive oxygen atoms can react with other oxygen molecules to form ozone (O3). The air is warmed up by this process.\n\nHere, the reaction in the air is presented in a more lively manner. The UV-light is symbolised by violet flashes, which split the oxygen molecule (O2) into two O atoms. The free O atoms each pair themselves up with another oxygen molecule, to form tri-atomic ozone (O3) molecules. These ozone molecules can also be split up again by the ultra-violet light.\n\nDestruction: The destructive reactions of ozone in the stratosphere\nIllustration Source: IUP Bremen\n\nOzone itself can be photolysed with weak ultra-violet light and even with light from the range of wavelengths which can be seen by the human eye. From the splitting of ozone, oxygen molecules (O2) and atoms (O) are produced again. The atomic oxygen can collide with another ozone molecule and split it up, to produce two oxygen molecules.\n\nThe reactions of ozone synthesis and photolysis occur very quickly. This means ozone is produced quickly and then destroyed quickly, and that the sunlight is absorbed quickly, and therefore effectively. During this process, a lot of heat is produced so the stratosphere warms up. Because the air is very thin at high altitudes, it is easier to warm up than air from lower layers. At higher altitudes there is not so much oxygen available for this reaction to take place. As for lower layers, the photolysis of oxygen is dependent on the availability of very short-wave sunlight and in lower layers of the stratosphere there is a shortage of the necessary short wavelength light because much of it is absorbed higher up in the atmosphere. These are the reasons for the existence of the ozone layer and the increase of temperature with height.\n\nAre there other ways to destroy ozone?\n\nThe mechanisms described above are the natural ways of producing and destroying ozone. But, in the stratosphere there are also other gases such as water vapour, nitrogen oxide and chlorine-containing compounds, which can destroy ozone.\n\nAnother mechanism is responsible for the famous Antarctic ozone hole. It involves reactions which occur on stratospheric ice crystals.\n\nIllustration: The ozone hole over the Antarctic in 1979 and 2000.\nIllustration Source: IUP Bremen\n\nA Summary:\n\nOzone is a tri-atomic form of normally two-atomic oxygen. Both the formation and the natural destruction of ozone occur through the splitting (photolysis) of oxygen or ozone molecules by high-energy UV sunlight. Ozone makes up about 3mm (300 Dobson units, or DU) of the total air column. The main part of this is found in the stratosphere between 20 and 35 km (ozone layer)."}

{"text": "Local Emissions\n\nAffecting the Air We Breath\n\nMotor vehicles emit a toxic stew of pollutants, which cause a host of environmental and health problems, ranging from acid rain to asthma. Below is a primer, providing the nuts and bolts on local emissions.\n\nWhat are local emissions?\n\nSulfur Dioxide - Sulfur Dioxide forms when fuels containing sulfur are burned. It can irritate the eyes and the respiratory tract. Prolonged inhalation can cause asthma and other respiratory diseases, including chronic bronchitis. It can cause premature death. Children, the elderly, and the infirm at the most at risk groups.\n\nNitrogen Oxide - Produced during combustion, Nitrogen Oxide, when combined with volatile organic compounds and sunlight, causes smog. It also reacts with other substances in the air to produce acid rain, which damages forests and lakes and corrodes buildings. It effects the human resperitory tract, resulting in asthma, bronchitis, and emphysema. Nitrous oxide is a greenhouse gas and contributes to global warming.\n\nParticulate Matter - Also known as PM, Particulate Matter is a complex combination of extremely small compounds, including dust, acids, and metals. The smaller the particles, the more dangerous they are. It can cause asthma, irregular heart beats, bronchitis, and premature death for people with lung diseases.\n*Source: US EPA.\n\nWhy Are They Called Local Emissions?\n\nUnlike Carbon Dioxide, the leading greenhouse gas that causes climate change, local emissions like the ones listed above primarily impact the immediate environment. People who live and work closest to areas that emit local pollutants - places like freeways, coal burning power plants, etc - are most likely to suffer health impacts.\n\nDr. Yifang Zhu, an Assistant Professor at Texas A&M University, has shown that in Los Angeles concentrations of carbon monoxide and ultra-fine particles dropped by 60-80% within 100 meters of the road (Zhu et al., 2002).\n\nNot So Local Anymore?\n\nMassive brown plumes of smog, resulting from the burning of fossil fuels and biomass, now stretch from the Arabian Peninsula to China, an indication that local pollution has become so concentrated and intense that it is starting to have global implications.\n\nWhile these clouds, which are visible by satellite and from airplanes, also hover over North America and Southern Africa, they are most prominent in Asia.\n\nThe clouds have such a strong environmental impact because they prevent light from passing through, affecting crop yields and forests that depend on photosynthesis.\n\nAt some points, clouds can be as much as a mile thick with yellow haze blotting out the sun."}
{"text": "What is Ozone?\n\nAnswer\n\nOzone also known as Trioxygen, is a molecule which is made up of three oxygen atoms. It is found in the upper layer of the atmosphere and is beneficial in filtering electromagnetic radiation from reaching the surface of the earth.\n\nOzone is both beneficial and harmful to us. Near the ground, ozone forming as a result of chemical reactions involving traffic pollution and sunlight may cause a number of respiratory problems, particularly for young children. However, high up...\nMore \u00bb\n\nOzone is an unstable, poisonous allotrope of oxygen, O3, which is formed naturally in the ozone layer from atmospheric oxygen by electric discharge or exposure to ultraviolet radiation. It is a highly reactive oxidizing agent with many uses including deodorising air, purifying water, and treating industrial wastes.\n\nOzone (O3) is a highly reactive gas composed of three oxygen atoms. Depending on where it is in the atmosphere, ozone affects life on Earth in either good or bad ways.\n\nThe ozone is a naturally occurring molecule that comprises of three atoms of oxygen. It is a very powerful oxidant thus it has a lot of chemical and industrial applications, especially those that relate to oxidation. Ozone is also known as trioxygen.\n\noscamaya\n\nOzone is a gas that is made up of 3 oxygen atoms. This is a highly reactive gas that can be found in our atmosphere. It is important because it reduces the amount of UV rays that reach the Earth's surface, and are potentially harmful to life. You can find more information here:"}
{"text": "Watch: Crash Course in Soot Air Pollution [Video]\n\nSeveral of our previous articles focused on soot pollution and on how these tiny particles released into the atmosphere mostly by coal power plants and the cars we drive ultimately impact on public health.\n\nHere is a video which pretty much summarizes all there is to know about soot, and about its effects on the wellbeing of our respiratory system.\n\nFirst of all, soot particles are smaller than the diameter of a human hair, so people who are breathing them in are virtually unaware of their doing so.\n\nSecondly, it seems that recent heat waves have caused changes in the atmospheric movement of soot particles, therefore making things worse for people already suffering from respiratory conditions.\n\nThe most interesting piece of information is that, ever since the Clean Air Act came into being in the US, average life expectancy for Americans rose by as much as six months, which only goes to show that human-driven pollution not only affects the environment, but also public health."}
{"text": "Runners experience life to its fullest. We feel the heat of the sun and the bite of the wind more intimately than those who shake their heads at us from their car windows. Our hearts, lungs, and muscles strain and improve with our efforts. As we suck up the marrow of life, however, we bring thousands of liters of air into our lungs-air that may be dangerously fouled by pollutants. In fact, urban runners are exposed to much greater quantities of air pollution than sedentary folks due to the large volumes of air we breathe while running.\n\nParticularly in summer, the prudent runner living in or near a city will check local air quality conditions daily. Pollution episodes are often caused by a temperature inversion in which warm polluted air becomes trapped between 2 layers of cooler air. The inversion layer prevents pollutants from dispersing in the upper atmosphere. Summer is also a time for discretion because exercising in the heat increases the detrimental effects of air pollution. Although the mechanism is poorly understood, heat and pollution together cause greater reductions in lung function and running performance than does pollution alone.\n\nThe most common types of air pollutants that affect distance running performance are ozone, carbon monoxide, and sulfur dioxide. The body's response to pollution is related to the concentration of the pollutant, and how much air is inhaled. There is a large degree of individual variability in responsiveness to pollution, and asthmatic runners should seek professional medical advice. Let's take a look at the 3 most common villains in our air.\n\nCarbon Monoxide (CO) is formed from burning oil, gas, coal, and wood, and is the most common air pollutant in our cities. Because its primary source is automobile emissions, carbon monoxide exposure is particularly high near urban highways. Carbon monoxide attaches to hemoglobin in your red blood cells which reduces the amount of oxygen transported to your muscles. Scientific evidence indicates that running in carbon monoxide concentrations > 25 parts per million can reduce your VO2 max and impair your running performance.\n\nSulfur Dioxide (SO2) is produced by power plants, smelters, refineries, and other industries. Running in sulfur dioxide concentrations > 0.5 ppm is likely to cause bronchoconstriction, wheezing, and chest tightness in asthmatics. Although sulfur dioxide concentrations typically found in U.S. cities do not generally cause symptoms in non-asthmatic runners, symptoms may occur during high intensity workouts or races.\n\nLittle is known about the chronic effects of exercise in a polluted environment. Lawrence Folinsbee, Ph.D., who has studied exercise and air pollution for over 15 years, acknowledges that more research is needed to determine the relationship between lung function and habitual exposure to air pollution in athletes. Dr. Folinsbee cautions, however, that runners who regularly train in polluted air may experience long-term changes in lung function.\n\nThe best strategy for dealing with pollution is to avoid it. A Minnesotan wouldn't go for a run in the winter without checking the temperature, and a Floridian wouldn't run at noon in the summer. Similarly, urban runners should make a habit of considering the environmental conditions. Read the paper, listen to the radio, or scan the internet to check the air quality where you live."}

There have been world conferences all about what to do but yet more and more Chinese are buying cars that pollute, and our factories in America still emit tons of pollutants into the air daily.\n\nBut the gas I am talking about is not what the cars or factories emit but what animals, us included, emit. If you can believe it, MedlinePlus says we produce one to four pints of it daily and pass it about 14 times a day.\n\nThankfully most is odorless, but bacteria in the large intestine can cause it to stink like sulfur.\n\nI can remember so fondly my friend's grandma Hetty. She must have been about 75 when I was six. Grandma wore a hearing aid but it was not one of those modern small ear ones.\n\nNo, it was a battery box, much bigger than a pack of cigarettes, which she wore on a cord hanging around her scrawny neck. Attached to it were two lines which went to the plugs she hung over her ears. They had small boxes about the size of a walnut in which the sensors were.\n\nThere were no wires leading to ear plugs so I guess the sensors picked up enough sound and passed it through her head into her ears.\n\nWell obviously they didn't work very well or she'd forget to turn up the volume on the big box so everyone just yelled at her. She was a tiny old lady with not much gray hair and knurled hands. But wow, did she have a temper. If things didn't go her way, we'd all watch out. She actually ran my neighbor's household; the mother just quaked whenever she walked into the room.\n\nBehind her back, we children laughed at her, especially when she let out a series of obnoxious gas odors as she walked across the room, oblivious to it all. Her gas permeated the entire room and we children fled outside to gasp a bit of fresh air.\n\nBut now the tide has turned and we children are now adults around grandma's age. I find that occasionally I'll let out a fart without thinking about it happening; it just does. I look around in sheer embarrassment in case someone else heard it or gets a whiff of it. Oh I could die on the spot when it happens.\n\nI know one should drink more water and also eat slowly to prevent swallowing air but those I things I often forget.

{"text": "By all means, yes, air pollution is hurting us, although many people pay no attention to it. More and more people are beginning to help though, and you can, too. Here are some helpful ways you can stop polluting the air:\n\nThe most air pollution is happening in major cities in all parts of the world. Cities aren't the best place to live when it comes to air pollution because of smog. Smog is a type of air pollution which has affected human heath the most of all air pollution in ever recorded history. It is caused by water molecules coming together with smoke particles in the atmosphere to form a dense fog. The smoke particles are often from burning coal. London had a severe fog in 1952 in which 4,000 deaths occurred. This was of the type of smog shown above.\n\nICE SMOG\n\nAnother type of smog is ice smog. Ice smog is when smoke particles and ice crystals combine. Ice smog happens only in high places, like mountains, and at very low temperatures.\n\nACID RAIN\n\nSomething else that happens from air pollution is acid rain. People call it acid rain because there is some acid in it which can destroy buildings, waterways, and many crops. Acid rain is when pollution is carried in the atmosphere for a long period of time.

{"text": "The Earth's protective ozone layer is getting thinner. There's less ozone to absorb harmful radiation from the sun, and more of this radiation is reaching the Earth's surface. This affects our atmosphere \u2013 and our health.\n\nOzone is a form of oxygen. It generally forms when oxygen (O2) from near the Earth's surface drifts high up into the atmosphere. Ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun hits the oxygen molecules.\n\nSome molecules split apart, creating single atoms. These atoms sometimes link up with O2 molecules, forming a new molecule with three oxygen atoms. That's ozone (O3).\n\nOzone can be helpful or harmful, depending on where it's located. If it's high up, it's good ozone. Ozone in the stratosphere protects people, animals, and plants from harmful ultraviolet rays.\n\nIn 1985 scientists found a large ozone hole in the stratosphere over Antarctica. Each year the hole became bigger, letting more ultraviolet light through to the Earth's surface. This situation is called stratospheric ozone depletion (SOD). Without the protection provided by ozone, we face a number of health problems.\n\nThe Other Face of Ozone\n\nOzone high in the stratosphere is good, but ozone near the ground is not. Do you ever hear \"ozone warnings\" on the weather report? Ozone can be very unhealthy.\n\nInhaling ozone can damage the respiratory tract, which enables us to breathe. Ozone also stunts plant growth. That hurts farmers, agriculture, and our economy.\n\nUp in the stratosphere, ozone (O3) acts as a natural sunscreen to protect us against ultraviolet (UV) radiation. That's the stuff that gives us sunburns. Because of the ozone layer, most of the harmful radiation never reaches Earth. But, as more and more of it does, we're at greater risk for skin and eye problems.\n\nPeople living near the Equator should be just as concerned about sun damage as people living where the ozone layer is thinning. The higher the sun is in the sky, the greater the direct sunlight reaching the Earth. Staying out of the sun when it is directly overhead (around noon hours), putting on sunscreen, and wearing a hat will help protect you.\n\nWhat's a \"hot spot\"?\n\nThe thinning of the ozone layer is not evenly spread around Earth. \"Hot spots\" are holes near the North and South Poles. People living in areas near the North and South Poles \u2013 including New Zealand, Australia, and the southern part of South America \u2013 are at extra risk of being harmed by ultraviolet radiation."}
{"text": "Pollution, people started complaining about coal dust and soot in the air over London, England. Since the beginning of the industrial revolution in the late 18 th century, humanity has been modifying the Earth's atmosphere and its chemistry. As industry spread across the globe, so did air pollution. Air pollution has many effects. In addition to being ugly, it can cause illness and even death, as well as damaging buildings, crops, and wildlife. Perhaps the worst air pollution recorded happened when dense smog (the combination of smoke and fog) formed over London on December 4, 1952 and lasted until March of 1953. Within six days over 4,000 people died, and 8,000 more died within six months.\n\nAir pollution is a broad term that is applied to particulate matter and chemical compounds that are released by humans into the atmosphere and modify its composition. It was first perceived as a local problem in urban industrialized areas, so factories and power plants started building taller smoke-stacks. However, taller stacks merely transported the problem elsewhere and soon regional problems such as acid rain were recognized. In Scandanavia, for example, the acidification of lakes was found to be the result of sulfur dioxide emissions from tall stacks located in central European countries such as Germany and even in places as far off as Great Britain. More recently, global problems such as climate change and stratospheric ozone depletion have been widely publicized.\n\nNatural sources that affect atmospheric chemistry include sulfur and nitrogen compounds from volcanoes and biological decay and particulate matter from dust storms and volcanoes. Plants, trees, and even grasses release volatile organic compounds (VOCs), such as methane, into the air. Of more concern, since we have the ability to control them, are anthropogenic, or man-made, air pollutants, such as carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, some fraction of VOCs, and nitrogen oxides. The largest source of anthropogenic pollution is the burning of fossil fuels, including coal, oil, and gas, in our homes, factories, and vehicles.\n\nAir pollutants are classified as either primary or secondary. A primary pollutant is one that is released directly to the air, such as the carbon monoxide from combustion. A secondary pollutant is formed in the atmosphere through chemical reactions of primary pollutants. The formation of tropospheric ozone is an example of secondary air pollution.\n\nYou might also be interested in:\n\nAcid rain is a general term used to describe different kinds of acidic air pollution. Although some acidic air pollutants return directly back to Earth, a lot of it returns in rain, snow, sleet, hail,...more\n\n10% of the ozone in the Earth's atmosphere is found in the troposphere, the first layer of the Earth's atmosphere.

{"text": "Carbon Monoxide\n\nGary Ginsberg (Toxicologist) gives expert video advice on: What is 'carbon monoxide'?; Is carbon monoxide poisonous?; What are the sources of carbon monoxide poisoning in the home? and more...\n\nWhat is 'carbon monoxide'?\n\nCarbon monoxide is again, a colorless, odourless gas and it's highly toxic. Because what it's doing when you absorb it into your body, is it's competing with oxygen for haemoglobin. Haemoglobin runs through our blood and it carries oxygen to the brain, to the muscles, to the nerves. Carbon monoxide has oxygen on it, and sort of, to haemoglobin, looks a little bit like oxygen. The problem is that carbon monoxide has a much higher affinity for haemoglobin than oxygen does, so it displaces oxygen off of haemoglobin, and it robs your tissues of oxygen.\n\nIs carbon monoxide poisonous?\n\nCarbon Monoxide is an insidious killer. It came to light when a famous tennis star Vetas Gerulaitis suddenly died at the heart of his career in a Queens home when he was staying over night with some friends and he didn't wake up the next morning sleeping in the basement because the home didn't have a carbon monoxide detector and it had a furnace malfunction carbon monoxide backed up into the basement and he died in his sleep.\n\nWhat are the sources of carbon monoxide poisoning in the home?\n\nAny combustion appliance in your home can be a source of Carbon Monoxide, from your furnace, to a kerosene heater, to a car running in an attached garage. All these appliances will release some Carbon Monoxide. It's important that they all be vented to the outside."}

{"text": "Program Links\n\nResources\n\nThe Ozone Weekend Effect in California\n\nThis page last reviewed June 19, 2009\n\nThis website provides information\nregarding research on the \"ozone weekend effect\", the phenomenon of\nozone concentrations tending to be higher on weekends than on weekdays\nin many urban areas around the world. This tendency is counter to\nexpectations because the emissions of ozone precursors (NOx\nand ROG) are lower (NOx more so than ROG) on\nweekends than weekdays. This counter-intuitive phenomenon is due to the\nfact that NOx emissions are primarily in the\nform of NO, which reacts to destroy ozone (O3) present in the air\n(i.e., suppresses ambient concentrations) to form nitrogen dioxide (NO2).\nHowever, this NO2, as well as additional NO2\ncreated from the NO emissions by photochemical catalytic reactions\ninvolving ROG (i.e., a single ROG molecule can recycle several times\nand oxidize multiple NO molecules to NO2\nmolecules) can react in sunlight to increase ozone concentrations. The\nphotolysis of NO2 (i.e., sunlight splitting the\nNO2 molecule into NO and O) is the only known\nsignificant pathway for creating the proper oxygen atom for reacting\nwith the abundant oxygen molecules (i.e., O2) in\nthe atmosphere (18%) to form ozone. The ROG emissions effectively\nenhance the conversion of NO to NO2 and\nultimately the formation of O3 concentrations significantly above\nnatural continental background levels (30-40 ppb). Thus, although fresh\nNOx emissions initially reduce ambient O3\nconcentrations, it is the magnitude of NOx\nemissions that control global background and regional maximums in O3\nconcentrations.\n\nA weekend effect workgroup was\nformed in 1999 to investigate the phenomenon and coordinate research\nefforts. Participants in the workgroup included the Coordinating\nResearch Council, the U.S. Department of Energy (NREL), the South Coast\nAir Quality Management District, private companies (e.g., Chevron,\nPacific Gas and Electric), and other interested parties (e.g.,\nacademia). The ARB published a peer-reviewed report and several of the\nparticipants published results in peer-reviewed literature.

{"text": "Ozone is a big buzz word these days. We mostly hear about the ozone layer, and the importance of protecting it. But if you want to understand what ozone's all about, you need to understand that it can be good, and it can be bad.\n\nThe stratosphere is the layer of the atmosphere from 10 to 30 miles above sea level. When there's ozone in this layer, it protects us from solar radiation. How? Simple chemistry.\n\nRegular oxygen molecules, known to science-types as O2, are made up of two oxygen atoms stuck together. Solar energy shoots in from space and splits that molecule into two atoms. When one of those stray atoms attaches to a full-fledged O2 molecule, you've got, well, O3, otherwise known as ozone. All that action blocks solar radiation, and keeps it from reaching us.\n\nImage above: The second largest ozone hole ever observed is seen above Antarctica in this image from September 2003. Credit: NASA\n\nHow can solar radiation be harmful to life on Earth? Part of that radiation is ultra-violet, or UV radiation. It's an intense energy from the Sun that can cause a whole lot of damage. Skin cancer is the most dramatic result of a too much UV radiation, but there's a lot more too. Photosynthesis in plants is also affected, and that causes problems for the whole food chain. See where this is headed? We need to protect our ozone shield, and we can do so by decreasing the pollution that our industrial society puts out in large amounts every day.\n\nLet's come down a little closer to Earth. The troposphere is everything below the stratosphere, from sea level to about 10 miles above. It's where everything lives. Things that happen to the troposphere happen to us; there's nothing indirect about it.\n\nPut a little ozone in the troposphere and you've got some big problems. Remember those dramatic chemical reactions that happened up in the stratosphere? Living things are made of atoms and molecules too, so when we expose them to ozone, we've got some serious chemical reactions on our hands.\n\nImage above: Parts of the Los Angeles area are considered to contain unhealthy amounts of ground level ozone. Red areas on the map indicate more than 100 parts per billion by volume of the molecule. Credit: EPA\n\nIn humans, it means lung damage. Small children and people with asthma are especially at risk. How can you help solve the problem?\n\nCars, trucks and SUVs are the biggest contributor to this ozone buildup. Engine exhaust creates nitrogen dioxide, so the more you drive, the more your vehicle creates. High gas prices aren't the only reason to leave the car in the garage.\n\nThe launch of Aura will culminate a 15-year international effort to establish the world's most comprehensive Earth Observing System, which aims to determine the extent, causes, and regional consequences of global change.\n\nNASA's Aura is going to keep tabs on both types of ozone. It's a spacecraft that will provide us the first comprehensive global view of the Earth's atmosphere, an essential stepping stone to better understanding the Moon, Mars and beyond. The launch of Aura is a challenging endeavor, a mission on the cutting edge of scientific discovery characteristic of the Agency's legacy of ground-breaking exploration.\n\nOne of its most impressive tools is the Ozone Monitoring Instrument, or OMI. The device will measure the amount of energy going into and coming out of the Earth, in a technique known as the \"backscatter\" method. The results of these observations will tell scientists how much ozone is over a particular area, and how much the area is gaining or losing over time.\n\nAura is a complex mission for a complex problem; but simply put, it's critical to understanding and protecting the air we breathe."}
{"text": "When we burn fossil fuels, they give off harmful by-products like carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide,and greenhouse gases that are said to be major contributors to climatechange. The EPA says that current carbon dioxide and nitrous oxidelevels are respectively 35 and 18 percent higher than they were inpre-industrial era. The other byproducts created by fossil fuels, suchas sulfur oxide, nitrogen oxide and hydrocarbons, are attributed to smog and acid rain.\n\nBut I digress; let's talk about why fossil fuels are unhealthy. We all know clean air is essential to leading a healthy life. Fossil fuels contribute to air pollution through the by-products and particulates that are released into the air. This type of airpollution carries the following risks:\n\nNitrogen Oxide \u2013 Major irritant to lungs, sometimes causing bronchitis and pneumonia as well as weakening the respiratory system\n\nSmog caused by Chemical Reaction of Nitrogen Oxide and Sulfur Oxide \u2013 Causes shortness of breath (asthma) and damage to the lungs over the long-term\n\nParticulates \u2013 Particles from soot and dust contribute to respiratory and cardiac ailments which include arrhythmias and heart attacks.\n\nDid you know that 85% percent of all the power produced in thiscountry comes from burning fossil fuels?

{"text": "Radon Entry\n\nRadon gas is being released by each soil granule under the home. This gas becomes part of the air under the home.

{"text": "Member Login\n\nPAHs and other toxic compounds; dioxins and furans\n\nPolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are a large group of chemical compounds consisting of two or more benzene rings joined together. Examples include napthalene (2 rings), phenanthrene/anthracene (3 rings), pyrene (4 rings) and one of the most studied, benzo[a]pyrene, has 5 rings. In ambient air they are found either as gases or associated with particles, produced from the incomplete combustion of carbon based fuels such as coal, oil, wood, gas, and petroleum fuels. Fossil-fueled power stations, industrial processes (e.g. aluminium production), domestic burning of fossil fuels and traffic, particularly in urban areas, are the main sources of PAHs in outdoor air. Cigarette smoke is an important source of PAHs in indoor air. Levels of individual PAHs are monitored in outdoor air, but they are always present with other PAHs as part of a complex mixture. Therefore, people are always exposed to a number of different PAHs, rather than single PAHs on their own.\n\nSome PAHs have been shown to be toxic and/or carcinogenic (cancer-causing)in animals and this information is used to determine the risk to humans. For example, benozo[a]pyrene, benz[a]anthracene, dibenz[ah]anthracene are classified by the IARC (International Agency for Research on Cancer) as 'probably carcinogenic to humans'. As PAHs can be inhaled into the lungs as gases or attached to particles, there is the risk of lung cancer. For example, increased incidence of lung cancer has been observed in men working in gas and coke production and aluminium refining who were exposed to high concentrations of PAH fumes over long periods of time.\n\nLevels of PAHs in outdoor air are much lower than those encountered in occupational settings and there is no convincing evidence, as yet, to suggest that PAHs in outdoor air are a significant cause of lung cancer in the general population. Estimating the health effects due to PAHs in outdoor air is made difficult by cigarette smoking, which is a source of PAHs in itself, and which can obscure contributions from outdoor sources in population studies."}

These arise both from natural processes and human activity. Substances not naturally found in the air or at greater concentrations or in different locations from usual are referred to as pollutants.\n\nPollutants can be classified as either primary or secondary. Primary pollutants are substances directly emitted from a process, such as ash from a volcanic eruption or the carbon monoxide gas from a motor vehicle exhaust.\n\nSecondary pollutants are not emitted directly. Rather, they form in the air when primary pollutants react or interact. An important example of a secondary pollutant is ground level ozone - one of the many secondary pollutants that make up photochemical smog.\n\nNote that some pollutants may be both primary and secondary: that is, they are both emitted directly and formed from other primary pollutants.\n\nNitrogen oxides (NOx) especially nitrogen dioxide are emitted from high temperature combustion.

Pollution is the introduction of contaminants into an environment that causes instability disorder harm or discomfort to the physical systems or living organisms they are in These factors are usually expressed as the weight of pollutant divided by a unit weight, volume, distance, or duration of the activity emitting the pollutant (e. g. , kilograms of particulate emitted per megagram of coal burned). Such factors facilitate estimation of emissions from various sources of air pollution. In most cases, these factors are simply averages of all available data of acceptable quality, and are generally assumed to be representative of long-term averages.\n\nThe United States Environmental Protection Agency has published a compilation of air pollutant emission factors for a multitude of industrial sources.

A pesticide is a substance or mixture of substances used to kill a pest.\n\nCarbon monoxide (CO) poisoning and fatalities are often caused by faulty vents and chimneys, or by the burning of charcoal indoors. Carbon monoxide, with the chemical formula CO is a colorless odorless tasteless yet highly toxic Gas.Charcoal' is the blackish residue consisting of impure Carbon obtained by removing water and other volatile constituents from Animal and Vegetation Chronic carbon monoxide poisoning can result even from poorly adjusted pilot lights. A pilot light is a small Gas Flame, usually Natural gas or Liquefied petroleum gas, which is kept alight in order to serve as an ignition source Traps are built into all domestic plumbing to keep sewer gas, hydrogen sulfide, out of interiors. Plumbing, from the Latin plumbum for Lead, is the skilled trade of working with pipes, tubing and Plumbing fixtures forHydrogen sulfide (or hydrogen sulphide) is the Chemical compound with the formula H 2 S. Clothing emits tetrachloroethylene, or other dry cleaning fluids, for days after dry cleaning. Tetrachloroethylene, also known under its systematic name tetrachloroethene and as perchloroethylene, perchloroethene, perc, and PCEDry cleaning is any cleaning process for Clothing and Textiles using an organic Solvent rather than Water.\n\nThough its use has now been banned in many countries, the extensive use of asbestos in industrial and domestic environments in the past has left a potentially very dangerous material in many localities. Asbestosis is a chronic inflammatory medical condition affecting the tissue of the lungs. Asbestosis is a chronic inflammatory medical condition affecting the Parenchymal tissue of the Lungs It occurs after long-term heavy exposureInflammation ( Latin, inflamatio, to set on fire is the complex biological response of vascular tissues to harmful stimuli such as Pathogenslung is the essential Respiration organ in air-breathing Animals including most Tetrapods a few Fish and a few Snails The most primitive It occurs after long-term, heavy exposure to asbestos from asbestos-containing materials in structures. Sufferers have severe dyspnea (shortness of breath) and are at an increased risk regarding several different types of lung cancer.

As clear explanations are not always stressed in non-technical literature, care should be taken to distinguish between several forms of relevant diseases. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), these may defined as; asbestosis, lung cancer, and mesothelioma (generally a very rare form of cancer, when more widespread it is almost always associated with prolonged exposure to asbestos). Asbestosis is a chronic inflammatory medical condition affecting the Parenchymal tissue of the Lungs It occurs after long-term heavy exposureMesothelioma is a form of Cancer that is almost always caused by previous exposure to Asbestos.\n\nBiological sources of air pollution are also found indoors, as gases and airborne particulates. Pets produce dander, people produce dust from minute skin flakes and decomposed hair, dust mites in bedding, carpeting and furniture produce enzymes and micrometre-sized fecal droppings, inhabitants emit methane, mold forms in walls and generates mycotoxins and spores, air conditioning systems can incubate Legionnaires' disease and mold, and houseplants, soil and surrounding gardens can produce pollen, dust, and mold.

Indoor Air Quality (IAQ deals with the content of interior air that could affect health and comfort of building occupants[3] A study by the University of Birmingham has shown a strong correlation between pneumonia related deaths and air pollution from motor vehicles. The University of Birmingham (informally Birmingham University) is a British red brick University located in the city of Birmingham Pneumonia is an inflammatory illness of the Lung. Frequently it is described as lung Parenchyma / alveolar inflammation and abnormal[11] Worldwide more deaths per year are linked to air pollution than to automobile accidents. Published in 2005 suggests that 310,000 Europeans die from air pollution annually. Direct causes of air pollution related deaths include aggravated asthma, bronchitis, emphysema, lung and heart diseases, and respiratory allergies. Asthma is a chronic Condition involving the Respiratory system in which the airways occasionally constrict become inflamed, and areBronchitis is an Inflammation of the Bronchi. More specifically it may refer to Acute bronchitis, caused by viruses or bacteria and lastingEmphysema is a chronic obstructive Pulmonary disease ( COPD) formerly termed a chronic obstructive Lung disease (COLD Diesel or Diesel fuel (\u02c8di\u02d0z\u0259l in general is any Fuel used in Diesel engines The most common is a specific fractional distillate of petroleumMyocardial infarction ( MI or AMI for acute myocardial infarction) also known as a heart attack, occurs when the blood supplyAsthma is a chronic Condition involving the Respiratory system in which the airways occasionally constrict become inflamed, and are\n\nThe worst short term civilian pollution crisis in India was the 1984 Bhopal Disaster Bhopal disaster was an Industrial disaster that occurred in the city of Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh, India, resulting in the immediate deaths[12] Leaked industrial vapors from the Union Carbide factory, belonging to Union Carbide, Inc. , U. S. A. , killed more than 2,000 people outright and injured anywhere from 150,000 to 600,000 others, some 6,000 of whom would later die from their injuries. The United Kingdom suffered its worst air pollution event when the December 4Great Smog of 1952 formed over London. The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom, the UK or Britain,is a Sovereign state located&quotDecember 4th&quot redirects here For the song by Jay-Z, see December 4th (song.The Great Smog, also referred to as the Big Smoke befell London from December 5th to December 9th 1952.London ( \u02c8l\u028cnd\u0259n is the capital and largest urban area in the United Kingdom. In six days more than 4,000 died, and 8,000 more died within the following months. An accidental leak of anthrax spores from a biological warfare laboratory in the former USSR in 1979 near Sverdlovsk is believed to have been the cause of hundreds of civilian deaths.

The United States of America \u2014commonly referred to as theDonora is a Borough in Washington County, Pennsylvania, USA 20 miles (32 km south of Pittsburgh on the Monongahela river[13]\n\nThe health effects caused by air pollutants may range from subtle biochemical and physiological changes to difficulty in breathing, wheezing, coughing and aggravation of existing respiratory and cardiac conditions. These effects can result in increased medication use, increased doctor or emergency room visits, more hospital admissions and premature death. The\n\nEffects on cystic fibrosis\n\nA study from 1999 to 2000 by the University of Washington showed that patients near and around particulate matter air pollution had an increased risk of pulmonary exacerbations and decrease in lung function. See Washington (disambiguation for other uses The University of Washington, founded in 1861, is a public research University [14] Patients were examined before the study for amounts of specific pollutants like P. aeruginosa or B. cepacia as well as their socioeconomic standing. Participants involved in the study were located in the United States in close proximity to an Environmental Protection Agency . During the time of the study 117 deaths were associated with air pollution. A trend was noticed that patients living closer or in large metropolitan areas to be close to medical help also had higher level of pollutants found in their system because of more emissions in larger cities. With cystic fibrosis patients already being born with decreased lung function everyday pollutants such as smoke emissions from automobiles, tobacco smoke and improper use of indoor heating devices could add to the dissemination of lung function. [15]\n\nEffects on COPD\n\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) include diseases such as chronic bronchitis, emphysema, and some forms of asthma. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD) is a Disease of the lungs in which the Airways become narrowedBronchitis is an Inflammation of the bronchi (medium-size airways in the Lungs Acute bronchitis is usually caused by VirusesEmphysema is a chronic obstructive Pulmonary disease ( COPD) formerly termed a chronic obstructive Lung disease (COLDAsthma is a chronic Condition involving the Respiratory system in which the airways occasionally constrict become inflamed, and are[16] Two researchers Holland and Reid conducted research on 293 male postal workers in London during the time of the 1952 London Fog incident and 477 male postal workers in the rural setting. The amount of the pollutant FEV1 was significantly lower in urban employees however lung function was decreased due to city pollutions such as car fumes and increased amount of cigarette exposure. [17] It is believed that much like cystic fibrosis, by living in a more urban environment serious health hazards become more apparent. Cystic fibrosis (also known as CF, mucoviscoidosis, or mucoviscidosis) is a hereditary disease affecting the exocrine (mucus glands of the lungs Studies have shown that in urban areas patients suffer mucus hypersecretion, lower levels of lung function, and more self diagnosis of chronic bronchitis and emphysema. [18]\n\nLondon Fog of 1952\n\nIn the matter of four days a combination of dense fog and sooty black coal smoke came over the London area. [19] The fog was so dense residents of London could not see in front of them. The extreme reduction in visibility was accompanied by an increase in criminal activity as well as transportation delays and a virtual shut down of the city. During the 4 day period of the fog 12,000 are believed to have been killed. [20]\n\nEffects on children\n\nCities around the world with high exposure to air pollutants has the possibility of children living within them to develop asthma, pneumonia and other lower respiratory infections as well as a low initial birth rate. Asthma is a chronic Condition involving the Respiratory system in which the airways occasionally constrict become inflamed, and arePneumonia is an inflammatory illness of the Lung. Frequently it is described as lung Parenchyma / alveolar inflammation and abnormal Protective measures to ensure the youths health is being taken in countries such as New Delhi where buses now use compressed natural gas to help eliminate the \"pea-soup\" fog.[21] Research by the World Health Organization shows there is the greatest concentration of particulate matter particles in countries with low economic world power and high poverty and population rates. Examples of these countries include Egypt, Sudan, Mongolia, and Indonesia. This article is about the country of Egypt For a topic outline on this subject see List of basic Egypt topics.Sudan (officially the Republic of Sudan) ( \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0648\u062f\u0627\u0646 al-S\u016bd\u0101n is a country in northeastern Africa.Mongolia (m\u0252\u014b\u02c8\u0261o\u028ali\u0259, literally Mongol country/nation,) is a Landlocked Country in East The Republic of Indonesia ( (Republik Indonesia is a Country in Southeast Asia. The Clean Air Act was passed in 1970, however in 2002 at least 146 million Americans were living in areas that did not meet at least one of the \"criteria pollutants\" laid out in the 1997 National Ambient Air Quality Standards. A Clean Air Act describes one of a number of pieces of legislation relating to the reduction of Smog and Air pollution in general[22] Those pollutants included: ozone, particulate matter, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, and lead. Because children are outdoors more and have higher minute ventilation they are more susceptible to the dangers of air pollution.\n\nReduction efforts\n\nThere are various air pollution control technologies and urban planning strategies available to reduce air pollution.\n\nEfforts to reduce pollution from mobile sources includes primary regulation (many developing countries have permissive regulations), expanding regulation to new sources (such as cruise and transport ships, farm equipment, and small gas-powered equipment such as lawn trimmers, chainsaws, and snowmobiles), increased fuel efficiency (such as through the use of hybrid vehicles), conversion to cleaner fuels (such as bioethanol, biodiesel, or conversion to electric vehicles). A cruise ship or cruise liner is a Passenger ship used for pleasure voyages where the voyage itself and the ship's amenities are part of the experienceA chainsaw (or chain saw) is a portable mechanical motorized Saw.A snowmobile (known locally as snowmachine, snowsled or by the Brandname Ski-Doo) is a land vehicle that is commonly propelled byA hybrid vehicle is a vehicle that uses two or more distinct power sources to propel the vehicleEthanol\n\nControl devices\n\nThe following items are commonly used as pollution control devices by industry or transportation devices. They can either destroy contaminants or remove them from an exhaust stream before it is emitted into the atmosphere. Pollution is the introduction of contaminants into an environment that causes instability disorder harm or discomfort to the physical systems or living organisms they are in\n\nLegal regulation\n\nSmog in Cairo\n\nIn general, there are two types of air quality standards.

Dioxin is a heterocyclic, organic, antiaromatic compoundFuran, also known as furane and furfuran, is a heterocyclic Organic compound. The first class of standards (such as the U. S. National Ambient Air Quality Standards) set maximum atmospheric concentrations for specific pollutants. The National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS are standards established by the United States Environmental Protection Agency that apply for outdoor Air Environmental agencies enact regulations which are intended to result in attainment of these target levels. The second class (such as the North American Air Quality Index) take the form of a scale with various thresholds, which is used to communicate to the public the relative risk of outdoor activity. The Air Quality Index ( AQI) is a standardized indicator of the Air Quality in a given location The scale may or may not distinguish between different pollutants.\n\nCanada\n\nIn Canada, air quality is typically evaluated against standards set by the Canadian Council of Minister for the Environment (CCME), an inter-governmental body of federal, provincial and territorial Ministers responsible for the environment. The CCME has set Canada Wide Standards(CWS). [23][24] These are:\n\nCWS for ozone = 65 ppb (8-hour averaging time, by year 2010, achievement is based on the 4th highest measurement annually, averaged over 3 consecutive years.\n\nNote that there is no consequence in Canada to not achieving these standards. In addition, these only apply to jurisdictions with populations greater than 100,000. Further, provinces and territories may set more stringent standards than those set by the CCME.\n\nEuropean Union\n\nNational Emission Ceilings (NEC) for certain atmospheric pollutants are regulated by Directive 2001/81/EC (NECD). [25] As part of the preparatory work associated with the revision of the NECD, the European Commission is assisted by the NECPI working group (National Emission Ceilings \u2013 Policy Instruments). The European Commission (formally the Commission of the European Communities) is the executive branch of the European Union.[26]\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nAir quality targets set by the UK's Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) are mostly aimed at local government representatives responsible for the management of air quality in cities, where air quality management is the most urgent. The Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs ( Defra) is the United Kingdom government department responsible for environmental protection The UK has established an air quality network where levels of the key air pollutants[27] are published by monitoring centers. [28] Air quality in Oxford, Bath and London[29] is particularly poor. Oxford is currently bidding for the 2010 Wikimania Conference Oxford () is a city, and the County town of Oxfordshire,Bath is a city in Somerset in the south west of England It is situated west of London and south-east of Bristol.London ( \u02c8l\u028cnd\u0259n is the capital and largest urban area in the United Kingdom.

The UK National Air Quality Information Archive offers almost real-time monitoring of \"current maximum\" air pollution measurements for many UK towns and cities. [33] This source offers a wide range of constantly updated data, including:\n\nHourly Mean Ozone (\u00b5g/m\u00b3)\n\nHourly Mean Nitrogen dioxide (\u00b5g/m\u00b3)\n\nMaximum 15-Minute Mean Sulphur dioxide (\u00b5g/m\u00b3)\n\n8-Hour Mean Carbon monoxide (mg/m\u00b3)\n\n24-Hour Mean PM10 (\u00b5g/m\u00b3 Grav Equiv)\n\nDEFRA acknowledges that air pollution has a significant effect on health and has produced a simple banding index system[34] is used to create a daily warning system that is issued by the BBC Weather Service to indicate air pollution levels. [35] DEFRA has published guidelines for people suffering from respiratory and heart diseases. [36]\n\nUnited States\n\nLooking down from the Hollywood Hills, with Griffith Observatory on the hill in the foreground, air pollution is visible in downtown Los Angeles on a late afternoon. The Hollywood Hills, an unofficial designation of part of Los Angeles, California, United States, are part of the eastern section of the low transverseGriffith Observatory is located in Los Angeles California, United States.Los Angeles (l\u0251\u02c8s\u00e6nd\u0292\u0259l\u0259s los \u02c8a\u014bxeles in Spanish) is the largest City in the state of California and the American West\n\nIn the 1960s, 70s, and 90s, the United States Congress enacted a series of Clean Air Acts which significantly strengthened regulation of air pollution. The United States Congress is the bicameral Legislature of the federal government of the United States of America, consisting of two housesA Clean Air Act describes one of a number of pieces of legislation relating to the reduction of Smog and Air pollution in general Individual U. S. states, some European nations and eventually the European Union followed these initiatives. The European Union ( EU) is a political and economic union of twenty-seven member states, located primarily in The Clean Air Act sets numerical limits on the concentrations of a basic group of air pollutants and provide reporting and enforcement mechanisms.\n\nIn 1999, the United States EPA replaced the Pollution Standards Index (PSI) with the Air Quality Index (AQI) to incorporate new PM2. The Air Quality Index ( AQI) is a standardized indicator of the Air Quality in a given location 5 and Ozone standards.\n\nThe effects of these laws have been very positive. In the United States between 1970 and 2006, citizens enjoyed the following reductions in annual pollution emissions:[37]\n\ncarbon monoxide emissions fell from 197 million tons to 89 million tons\n\nnitrogen oxide emissions fell from 27 million tons to 19 million tons\n\nsulfur dioxide emissions fell from 31 million tons to 15 million tons\n\nparticulate emissions fell by 80%\n\nlead emissions fell by more than 98%\n\nIn an October 2006 letter to EPA, the agency's independent scientific advisors warned that the ozone smog standard \"needs to be substantially reduced\" and that there is \"no scientific justification\" for retaining the current, weaker standard. The scientists unanimously recommended a smog threshold of 60 to 70 ppb after they conducted an extensive review of the evidence. [38]\n\nThe EPA has proposed, in June 2007, a new threshold of 75 ppb. This falls short of the scientific recommendation, but is an improvement over the current standard.\n\nPolluting industries are lobbying to keep the current (weaker) standards in place. Environmentalists and public health advocates are mobilizing to support compliance with the scientific recommendations.\n\nThe National Ambient Air Quality Standards are pollution thresholds which trigger mandatory remediation plans by state and local governments, subject to enforcement by the EPA. The National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS are standards established by the United States Environmental Protection Agency that apply for outdoor Air\n\nAn outpouring of dust layered with man-made sulfates, smog, industrial fumes, carbon grit, and nitrates is crossing the Pacific Ocean on prevailing winds from booming Asian economies in plumes so vast they alter the climate.

The National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS are standards established by the United States Environmental Protection Agency that apply for outdoor Air Air pollution is a health concern even in developed countries like the U. S.\n\nAtmospheric dispersion\n\nThe basic technology for analyzing air pollution is through the use of a variety of mathematical models for predicting the transport of air pollutants in the lower atmosphere. Atmospheric dispersion modeling is the mathematical simulation of how air pollutants disperse in the ambient atmosphere.Note The term model has a different meaning in Model theory, a branch of Mathematical logic. The principal methodologies are:\n\nPoint source dispersion, used for industrial sources. Air pollution dispersion terminology describes the words and Technical terms that have a special meaning to those who work in the field of Air pollution dispersion modeling\n\nVisualization of a buoyant Gaussian air pollution dispersion plume as used in many atmospheric dispersion models\n\nThe point source problem is the best understood, since it involves simpler mathematics and has been studied for a long period of time, dating back to about the year 1900. Air pollution dispersion terminology describes the words and Technical terms that have a special meaning to those who work in the field of Air pollution dispersion modeling Roadway air dispersion modeling is the study of Air pollutant transport from a roadway or other linear emitterAir pollution dispersion terminology describes the words and Technical terms that have a special meaning to those who work in the field of Air pollution dispersion modelingA wildfire, also known as a wildland fire, forest fire, brush fire, vegetation fire, grass fire, Peat fire,Photochemistry, a sub-discipline of Chemistry, is the study of the interactions between Atoms, small Molecules, and light (or Electromagnetic radiationSmog is a kind of Air pollution; the word &quotsmog&quot is a Portmanteau of Smoke and Fog. It uses a Gaussian dispersion model for buoyant pollution plumes to forecast the air pollution isopleths, with consideration given to wind velocity, stack height, emission rate and stability class (a measure of atmospheric turbulence). Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777 &ndash 1855 is the Eponym of all of the topics listed belowA contour line (also Level set, isopleth, isoline, isogram or isarithm) of a function of twoIn Fluid dynamics, turbulence or turbulent flow is a fluid regime characterized by chaotic Stochastic property changes[42][43] This model has been extensively validated and calibrated with experimental data for all sorts of atmospheric conditions.\n\nThe roadway air dispersion model was developed starting in the late 1950s and early 1960s in response to requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act and the U.S. Department of Transportation (then known as the Federal Highway Administration) to understand impacts of proposed new highways upon air quality, especially in urban areas. Roadway air dispersion modeling is the study of Air pollutant transport from a roadway or other linear emitterThe National Environmental Policy Act ( NEPA) is a United States environmental law that was signed into law on January 1, 1970 by UThe United States Department of Transportation ( DOT) is a federal Cabinet department of the United States government concerned with Transportation Several research groups were active in this model development, among which were: the Environmental Research and Technology (ERT) group in Lexington, Massachusetts, the ESL Inc. Lexington is a town in Middlesex County, Massachusetts, United States. group in Sunnyvale, California and the California Air Resources Board group in Sacramento, California. Sunnyvale ( or) is a city in Santa Clara County, California, United States.The California Air Resources Board, also known as ( CARB) is the &quotclean air agency&quot in the Government of California. The research of the ESL group received a boost with a contract award from the United States Environmental Protection Agency to validate a line source model using sulfur hexafluoride as a tracer gas. Sulfur hexafluoride is an Inorganic compound with the formula. This program was successful in validating the line source model developed by ESL inc.

Currently, scientists are studying the role of changes in composition of greenhouse gases from natural and anthropogenic sources for the effect on climate change.

{"text": "Section 112 of the Clean Air Act identifies 188 compounds emitted from stationary, area, and\nmobile sources as hazardous air pollutants (also known as \"air toxics\"). The EPA has\nclassified many of these substances as \"known,\" \"probable,\" or\n\"possible\" human carcinogens. Air toxics are associated with a wide variety of\nnoncancer adverse health effects that include neurological, cardiovascular, liver, kidney, and\nrespiratory effects as well as effects on the immune and reproductive systems. The seriousness of\nthe harm can range from headaches and nausea to respiratory arrest and death. Severity varies with\nthe amount and length of exposure, the nature of the chemical itself (e.g., how it interacts with\nvarious organs and organ systems), and the unique behaviors and sensitivities of individual people.\nSome chemicals pose particular hazards to people of certain ages or genetic backgrounds.\n\n2. How did EPA characterize risk from the modeled 1999 exposure estimates?\n\nTo evaluate a chemical's potential to cause cancer and other adverse health\neffects, EPA examines which adverse effects a particular substance causes (in a \"hazard\nidentification\"), determines the exposure to the population (in an \"exposure\nassessment\"), and evaluates the specific exposures at which these effects might occur\n(in a \"dose-response assessment\"). The evaluation is based on studies of humans,\nanimals, and microorganisms, usually published in peer-reviewed scientific journals. In this\nnational-scale assessment, EPA combined information from dose-response assessments with modeled\nexposure estimates in a \"risk characterization\" to describe the potential that real-\nworld exposures to air toxics compounds might cause harm. The EPA also examined the uncertainties\nsurrounding the characterization of risk.\n\nAt present, EPA typically assumes a linear relationship between the level of\nexposure and the lifetime probability of cancer from an air toxics compound. It expresses this\ndose-response relationship for cancer in terms of a unit\nrisk estimate. The unit risk estimate (URE) is an upper\nbound estimate of an individual's probability of contracting cancer over a lifetime of exposure\nto a concentration of one microgram of the pollutant per cubic meter of air. Risks from exposures\nto concentrations other than one microgram per cubic meter are usually calculated by multiplying\nthe actual concentration to which someone is exposed by the URE. For example, the EPA may determine\nthe URE of a particular air toxics compound to be one in ten thousand per microgram per cubic meter.\nThis means that a person who inhales air containing an average of one microgram per cubic meter for\n70 years would have (as an upper bound) one chance in ten thousand (or 0.01%) of contracting cancer\nas a result. The EPA has developed UREs for many substances, and continues to re-examine and update\nthem as knowledge improves. More information on UREs can be found in the EPA's\nIntegrated Risk Information System. The UREs used in this\nassessment, along with associated uncertainties and a summary of the EPA's risk assessment\nguidelines for carcinogens, are included in the Health Effects Criteria\ndiscussion.\n\n4. How were the cancer risk estimates affected by EPA's recently revised Guidelines for Carcinogen\nRisk Assessment (EPA/630/P-03/001F) and new Supplemental Guidance for Assessing Susceptibility from\nEarly-Life Exposure to Carcinogens (EPA/630/R-03/003F)?\n\nThe revised Guidelines were released after the risk calculations for the national-scale\nassessment were completed. However, the effective guidance at the time we calculated the risks\n(an earlier draft of the revised Guidelines) was consistent in most ways with the revised document.\nThere was one important exception to this consistency, however. The cancer guidelines now include\nSupplemental Guidance that makes new recommendations with regard to estimating cancer risks to\nchildren. These recommendations have not been implemented for the chemicals included in the\nnational-scale assessment, with the exception of vinyl chloride.\n\nThe Supplemental Guidance recommends that risks to children be adjusted for carcinogenic\nchemicals acting through a mutagenic and linear mode of action (i.e., chemicals that cause cancer\nby damaging genes). Where available data for the chemical are adequate they should be used to\ndevelop age-specific potency values, as EPA has already done for vinyl chloride (and which are\nalready reflected for that chemical in the national-scale assessment). Where available data do\nnot support a chemical-specific evaluation of differences between adults and children, the\nSupplemental Guidance recommends the use of the following default adjustment factors for early-\nlife exposures: increase the carcinogenic potency by 10-fold for children up to 2 years old, and\n3-fold for children from 2 to 15 years old. These adjustments have the aggregate effect of\nincreasing by about 60% the estimated risk for a 70-year (lifetime) constant inhalation exposure.\n\nIt is important to keep in mind that EPA recommends that the default adjustments be made only\nfor carcinogens (1) acting through a mutagenic mode of action, (2) for which a linear dose response\nhas been assigned, and (3) for which data to evaluate adult and juvenile differences are not\navailable. The default adjustments are not recommended for carcinogens whose mode of action is\nunknown. EPA will determine as part of the IRIS assessment process which substances meet these\ncriteria, and future national-scale assessments will reflect adjustments for those substances.\n\nThe process of developing the unit risk estimate (URE) includes several important sources of uncertainty.\n\nFirst, many of the air toxics compounds in this assessment were classified as probable carcinogens, which means that data were not sufficient to prove these substances definitely cause cancer in humans. It is possible that some are not human carcinogens at environmentally relevant doses, and that the true cancer risk associated with these air toxics is zero.\n\nSecond, all UREs used in this assessment were based on linear extrapolation from high to low exposures. To the extent that true dose-response relationships for some air toxics compounds are less than linear, this assumption may result in overestimates of cancer risk.\n\nThird, UREs for most of these substances were developed from animal data using conservative methods to extrapolate between species. Actual human responses may differ from the predicted ones.\n\nFourth, most UREs used in this assessment (benzene is a notable exception to this) were based on statistical procedures that give the upper bound on the URE, which will likely result in an overstatement of risk.\n\nOn balance, we believe that true cancer risk from the assessed air toxics compounds would probably be less than that calculated in this assessment, although the possibility remains that it could be greater.\n\n6. Does EPA distinguish among chemicals based on the type of data that supports\nits carcinogenic potential?\n\nThe EPA uses a system called the weight-of-evidence for carcinogenicity for characterizing the\nextent to which available data support the hypothesis that a compound causes cancer in humans.\nUnder the EPA's 1986 risk assessment guidelines, the weight-of-evidence was described by Groups\n(A through E). Group A contains \"known\" carcinogens, or compounds for which evidence\nis sufficient to demonstrate a causal relationship between exposure and cancer incidence in humans.\nGroup B contains \"probable\" carcinogens, for which evidence of cancer in humans is\nsuggestive (Group B1) or evidence of cancer in animals is conclusive (Group B2). Group C\ncontains \"possible\" carcinogens, for which animal evidence is suggestive but not\nconclusive. Group D contains agents for which no evidence exists (so it cannot be said whether\nthe compound is or is not a carcinogen). Group E contains compounds for which adequate negative\nevidence exists (so it can be said that the compound is not a carcinogen). The approach outlined\nin the EPA's proposed guidelines for carcinogen risk assessment (1999) considers all scientific\ninformation in determining whether and under what conditions an agent may cause cancer in humans,\nand provides a narrative approach to characterizing carcinogenicity (rather than using categories\nor groups).\n\nBecause risk estimates are probabilities, cancer risks associated with different substances can\nbe added together as long as the substances cause cancer by (1) similar mechanisms, or (2)\ncompletely independent mechanisms. Addition of cancer risk estimates is inappropriate only where\nsubstances interact in ways that either enhance or inhibit each other's carcinogenic potency.\nHad it been available, information on non-additive interactions would have been considered (as\nrecommended in the EPA's 1986 Guidelines for the Health Risk Assessment of Chemical Mixtures,\n52 FR 34014-34025). Because no such information was identified, the EPA used the guidelines'\ndefault assumption that cancer risks from different air toxics compounds may be added.\n\nThe EPA typically expresses dose-response relationships for effects other than cancer in terms\nof the inhalation reference concentration (RfC).\nThe RfC is a concentration of the compound in air thought to be without adverse effects even if a\nperson is exposed continuously. In other words, exposures below the RfC will probably not cause\nadverse noncancer health effects.\n\nTo express noncancer hazards the EPA uses the RfC as part of a calculation called the\nhazard quotient (HQ), which is the\nratio between the concentration to which a person is exposed and the RfC. A value of the HQ less\nthan one indicates that the exposure is lower than the RfC and that no adverse health effects would\nbe expected. A value of the HQ greater than one indicates that the exposure is higher than the\nRfC. However, because many RfCs incorporate protective assumptions in the face of uncertainty, an\nHQ greater than one does not necessarily suggest a likelihood of adverse effects. Furthermore,\nthe HQ cannot be translated to a probability that adverse effects will occur and is not likely to\nbe proportional to risk. An HQ greater than one can best be described as indicating that a\npotential exists for adverse health effects.\n\nThe EPA has developed RfCs for many substances, and continues to re-examine and update them as\nknowledge improves. More information on RfCs can be found in the EPA's\nIntegrated Risk Information System. The RfCs (and\nequivalent values) used in this assessment, along with associated uncertainties and a summary of\nthe EPA's risk assessment guidelines for effects other than cancer, are included on the\nHealth Effects Criteria page.\n\n9. Can noncancer hazard estimates for different substances be combined?\n\nBecause different pollutants may cause similar adverse health effects, it is often appropriate\nto combine hazard quotients associated with different substances. The EPA has drafted revisions\nto the national guidelines on mixtures that support combining the effects of different substances\nin specific and limited ways. Ideally, hazard quotients should be combined for pollutants that\ncause adverse effects by the same toxic mechanism. However, because detailed information on toxic\nmechanisms was not available for most of the substances in this assessment, the EPA used a simpler\nand more conservative method also outlined in these draft guidelines. The combined noncancer\nhazards associated with respiratory irritation caused by 41 pollutants and neurological effects\nassociated with 20 pollutants were calculated using the hazard\nindex (HI), defined as the sum of hazard quotients for individual air toxics compounds that\naffect the same organ or organ system. The HI is only an approximation of the\ncombined effect because some of the substances may affect the target organs in different\n(i.e., non-additive) ways. As with the HQ, a value of the HI below 1.0 will likely not result in\nadverse effects over a lifetime of exposure. However, a value of the HI greater than\n1.0 does not necessarily suggest a likelihood of adverse effects. Furthermore, the HI cannot be\ntranslated to a probability that adverse effects will occur and is not likely to be\nproportional to risk. An HI greater than one can be best described as indicating that a potential\nmay exist for adverse effects to respiratory or nervous system."}
