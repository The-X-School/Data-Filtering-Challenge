{"text": "bark\n\nbark, in woody plants, tissues external to the vascular cambium (the growth layer of the vascular cylinder); the term bark is also employed more popularly to refer to all tissues outside the wood. The inner soft bark, or bast, is produced by the vascular cambium; it consists of secondary phloem tissue whose innermost layer conveys food from the leaves to the rest of the plant. The outer bark, which is mostly dead tissue, is the product of the corkcambium (phellogen). Layered outer bark, containing cork and old, dead phloem, is known as rhytidome. The dead cork cells are lined with suberin, a fatty substance that makes them highly impermeable to gases and water. Gas exchange between the inner tissues of bark-covered roots and stems and their surroundings takes place through spongy areas (lenticels) in the cork.\n\nBark is usually thinner than the woody part of the stem or root. Both inner bark (secondary phloem) and wood (secondary xylem) are generated by the vascular cambium layer of cells: bark toward the outside where the oldest layers may slough off, and wood toward the inside where it accumulates as dead tissue"}

Also, callus may be produced\naround the canker that makes it more sunken.\n\nWhat causes\ncankers?\n\nPathogens are\nmostly Ascomycota. Many also have an asexual\nstage in the Deuteromycota.\n\nThere are some diseases usually considered\nwith other groups that also involve cankers:\n\nCanker rots\n\nSome basidiomycetes that decay wood in\nthe stem may also kill patches of sapwood\nand bark. We consider them along with stem-decay fungi.\n\nStem rusts\n\nThese cause cankers, but we consider\nthem separately.\n\nFoliage diseases, shoot and tip\nblights\n\nSome of these kinds of diseases also\ncan involve cankers of twigs, branches, and even main stems.\n\nIt is amazing for how few of them we really\nknow how the pathogen gets in. We think that generally none of them\npenetrate intact bark.\n\nOften, cankers are\ncentered around a wound or branch stub, suggesting that they were the\ninfection court. But seeing a branch at the center does not tell us much.\nDid the pathogen colonize the branch or stub after it was dead, then\nattack the nearby living stem? Or did it infect the branch while it was\nalive (perhaps through some kind of wound?) and then grow down into the\nstem, killing the branch in the process?\n\nSome people have trouble with this. Cankers\nare a good topic for examples. For example, the pathogen\nof coral-spot Nectria canker has both a sexual and asexualfruiting structure that occur separately. The\nsexual structure is in the perithecialascomycetes,\ncharacteristic of the genus Nectria, and the fungus is called Nectria\ncinnabarina.\n\nThe asexual structure is a sporodochium.\nFungi with sporodochia are classified in the Deuteromycota. This\nparticular sporodochium and conidia it produces\nbelong in the genus Tubercularia, and this one is Tubercularia\nvulgaris.\n\nSo the pathogen\nhas two names. They both refer to the same fungus. If we want to refer to\nthe whole fungus (as we usually do), it is usually best to refer to the\nname for the sexual stage, because, as with plants, that is the stage\nusually used to indicate relationships. So we call this pathogen Nectria\ncinnabarina. But you may also hear people refer to the asexual stage\nby name.\n\nFor some fungi, though, we may just see the\nasexual stage. Cytospora canker is an example. We\nalmost always only see pycnidia. So it is natural\nto call it by the stage that we see, Cytospora or Leucocytospora.\n\nFor some fungi, a sexual stage may never\nhave been seen. Pitch canker is an example. All we see are sporodochia,\nso we can use only the name for the asexual stage, which in this case is Fusarium.\n\nIn other cases, there may be both stages,\nbut the sexual stage is so consistently present that we don't need to use\nthe name for the other stage and there may not be one. Hypoxylon canker is\nan example. There are conidia, but you never hear a name for that stage.\nThere are almost always perithecia around to\nidentify."}

{"text": "Can a tree blush green?\n\nMay 11th, 2010\n\nQ: It's happening again. Every spring my wife notices the onset of buds on the trees and tells me they are \"blushing green.\" I tell her that \"blushing\" refers to red, not green. She tells me that if I can find a better way to convey the idea of \"blushing green,\" she will deign to use it. Can you help?\n\nA: We think your wife's description of tender young buds as \"blushing green\" is delightful, and it's not as farfetched as you might think. The original meaning of \"blush,\" in the 14th century, had nothing to do with redness.\n\nThe word \"blush\" first showed up as a verb, according to the Oxford English Dictionary, and initially meant to \"cast a glance\" or \"give a look.\" The OED's earliest written citation is from 1325.\n\nThe noun \"blush\" was first recorded in writing in about 1340, when it meant \"a gleam, a blink.\" By this time, the verb was being used to mean \"shine forth.\"\n\nA slightly later sense of the noun \u2013 \"a glance, glimpse, blink, look\" \u2013 was recorded about 1375 in the expression \"aftur the furste blusch.\" We still use the word this way, in the phrase \"at first blush\" (the equivalent of \"at first glance\").\n\nThe current sense of the verb \"blush,\" meaning \"to become red in the face, (usually) from shame or modesty,\" came along in the mid-15th century, the OED says.\n\nThe first written citation is from about 1450, in the phrase \"blushed red.\" Later, the \"red\" became unnecessary and \"blushing\" by itself meant turning red.\n\nThe use of the noun \"blush\" to mean \"the reddening of the face caused by shame, modesty, or other emotion\" was first recorded in Shakespeare, the OED says."}

The insects that transmit the disease are not active right now in January, but since our weather is as unpredictable as our insects, if you're pruning an oak, the best advice is to always cover any cuts with pruning paint.\n\nOn other trees, you don't need to apply pruning paint. It does inhibit the natural healing process that occurs when you prune in the proper place on the tree. So normally you would not apply pruning paint of any sort."}
{"text": "The trees have been selected in their individual areas because they grew not too far away from other trees, but not too densely with others either. They have been selected because they have the ideal (full foliage) south side, which gets the most exposure to sunlight. Most branches are like a wave, growing down and then upwards to achieve more space. (See Fig. 1) Some lower branches near the base of the tree have split up into two, and sometimes three, different sub-branches, like Y's. This is not done in upper branches, probably because of the weight that is required to support this. Some branches also crossed and overlapped each other, but this did not affect the branch length or angle of the trees. There are more branches in the middle and near the top of the tree, since that is the area with the most sunlight, than at the bottom of the tree. This allows for the optimal efficiency in solar energy collection. It has been noticed in the photographs that some of the lower branches are slightly under 90\u00b0, and the upper branches near the tops of each tree are over 100\u00b0. Branches at the bottom are also usually longer than they are at the top, for stability.\n\nIn some of the older trees that are taller in height with longer branches, the centre of the tree is bare, because those needles have senesced due to old age and excessive shade from other needles on the outside. To make it so that the tree will not have to support useless needles, some of the older trees shed the inner needles so there is less weight to support, and less areas to photosynthesize to, conserving energy. The average length of a branch that is bare without needles was 30.6 inches across 20 trees. (See Fig. 2)\n\nThe trees all have a good exposure to sunlight, and grow in an environment that is grassy and flat. There were often other trees of the same species growing nearby with branch angles that were quite variable, some growing at an upward angle, others drooping in a downward angle. Some areas even contain deciduous trees. The trees chosen, and their neighbours, are all usually around the same height growing in one area, since they all started growing at approximately the same time, based on the number of vertical branch whorls. There is usually a reasonable amount of fertile soil in the areas, with some more moist than others. Nonetheless, there is not a significant difference in moisture to affect the growth of the trees. Another factor that has remained constant is that the trees are all in areas where they would all experience similar amounts of annual sunlight, snowfall and other growth-determining factors. Some areas have little plants growing at the base of the tree, but there is not a dense amount to affect the health of the tree. (See Fig. 3)\n\nWhen it comes to branch angles, most of the range is from 80\u00b0 to 120\u00b0, which is near the angle that is necessary to be perpendicular to the sun (90\u00b0). Most of the modal, median and mean angles range from 90\u00b0 to 100\u00b0, since these are the most common angles. Data obtained from the branch angle measurements is fairly consistent and constant along the main stem of each tree, regardless of the different quadrants and environments in which these trees grow. Most of the branch angles on any one tree are very similar, even though they occur at different tree heights. This indicates that all trees of the Picea glauca family use the same basic rules for growth and solar energy collection.\n\nIt can also be observed that there is somewhat of a consistent ratio for the tree height to average branch length of the entire tree. There are a few exceptions where the tree stops growing in terms of height, but continues to grow longer branches. The ratio, then, only applies when the tree is growing in the optimal manner for collecting sunlight at first. The ratio ranges from 0.25 to 0.71, which is very close when one is examining the very natural growth of trees that could easily be changed by some specific environmental factors. If one were to state a general ratio number, they could use the mean of all the data ratios that have been collected: 0.426118209. This is the standard ratio number that will be used later on in procedures for this project. Tree height was something that has been manipulated and measured, but only for the purpose of determining whether or not the basic ratio changes with height. Since it does not, the height of a tree would seem not to be relevant when its sole purpose is to collect the optimal amount of solar energy.\n\nThis project is the intellectual property of Eden Full. Use of this information for one's own purposes is not permitted."}

{"text": "Beech (collected myself)\n\nThe beech tree is known as the \"mother of the woods,\" queen to the king oak. In fact, they belong to the same family as oaks, Fagaceae.\n\nBeech trees have a mystical legacy. Along with oak, they were included in the sacred grove of Dodona at the temple of Zeus in Greece. Druids practiced their rituals in beech groves when oaks weren't available. Also, forked beech branches are sometimes used as dowsing rods, and beechnuts are used as amulets.\n\nIt's not uncommon to see a beech tree dressed in last year's crisp, dead leaves. For this reason the beech tree is associated with cycles, change, passing generations, rebirth and transformation.\n\nIts leaves drip something that kills weeds and makes the soil rich. This helps other deciduous trees thrive, though its not good for grass or evergreens growing beneath it. That's probably why beech trees have the reputation for selfish ambition, the ambition of a forest queen who \"bears no rival near the throne.\""}

{"text": "Brush Killer\n\nAre there any brush killers that are safe to use around mature trees. We have some large pines with very overgrown undergrowth. I would just go in and start cutting but there is also some poison ivy. I looked at Bonide brush killer and it seems to indicate it would work. I would also like to use it around the perimeter of our yard where the growth has taken over.\n\nRoundup will kill almost everything that it comes in contact with, so if you spray the undergrowth and don't get any on the needles of the pines you will be OK.\n\nDepending how much you need to spray, you can purchase a gallon of the equivalent called \"Pronto big and tough\" 41% solution from tractor supply for about $25. Roundup will cost 5x that. Use it in a 2% solution (2.5 oz to a gallon ) so a gallon goes a long way. It will kill the weeds and anything else green. For grass it takes about 7-9 days for results. Really tough stuff like American Barberry takes about 3 weeks to show the results.\n\nI am in the middle of a mission to spray and kill invasive Barberry in my 30 acre wood lot so am quite familiar with this material.\n\nDo not use anything like 2,4-D as that will get into the soil and possibly harm the pines. -- The difference between genius and stupidity is that genius has its limits.\n\nI'd try 2,4-d first and see if that kills most of the stuff. That won't hurt the grass or trees but should kill most of the other stuff. It won't kill the poison ivy but if you can kill everything else then you can come back later with some Roundup aka glyphosate in a dish and use a paintbrush to apply the glyphosate to the poison ivy to be safe. Any chemicals can get into the soil but 2,4-d and glyphosate are both classified as non-persistent to slightly persistent. 2,4-d is a broad-leaf killer so it's selective while glyphosate will kill anything it touches. Glyphosate shouldn't hurt the tree as long as you don't get any on the leaves but that's a call you'll have to make.\n\nAs you can see I have a pretty extensive collection of weed killer products directly from the farm supply store.\n\nMy next-door neighbor is going south of the border, so we'll probably go splits on the 2.5gal and also get some weed-and-feed that's been banned from our stores by dem damn treahuggers dustwvl I've had good luck with Round Up. For small weeds and grasses a single spray will due, for larger stuff you'll need to do multiple treatments. Round Up works through the plant's leaves, so it's best to spray on the leaves (top and underside) and avoid the soil where practical.\n\nI used it on some very aggressive ivy, it took several days of spraying to start to kill it off, and then I ended up just yanking a lot of it down followed by pulling it's stump out with my SUV at the time (this ivy had grown so large and so enormous that it had a trunk the diameter of a small tree (at least 6\" around).\n\nKeep in mind that if you have poison ivy, the stuff that is 'poison' will remain even after the plant is dead... so exercise caution pulling out the dead stuff.\n\nWhat I recently did in my yard was to say eff it and buy several yards of mulch, I put a 3-4\" barrier of mulch down, first off it's black, so in the sun it gets HOT, second, most weeds will not grow through that much mulch... so if you can rent a brush cutter to get it all down to the 1-2\" level you might consider just covering it w/ mulch.\n\nThanks everyone. I have been out of town and I am just getting back in the swing of things. Thanks for all the help.\n\nJust a note: Roundup is effective. I think its patent on glyphosate expired back in 2000, so there are a few generic products like the one I posted the link for (Compare-N-Save 2.5 gal. Grass And Weed Killer) and Pronto that are based on the same active ingredient, just cost a heck of a lot less.\n\nThey literally were giving it away last year... I got a gallon of round up with a remote pump/sprayer with purchase of something, I think a 40lb bag of grass seed or something...\n\nI read something about adding some dish soap to the mix to help it stick to the plants especially ones with a waxy coating. Any opinions on this?\n\nYou want a nonionic agent. Some dish soaps are OK but Jet Dry actually states it is non-ionic on the label. Typical rate is 0.5% or just over 1/2oz per Gallon. -- The difference between genius and stupidity is that genius has its limits."}
{"text": "How to Prune a Tree - A Graphic Tutorial\n\n2 of 9\n\nCrown thinning is a pruning technique primarily used on hardwood trees. Crown thinning is the selective removal of stems and branches to increase light penetration and air movement throughout the crown of a tree. The intent is to improve a tree's structure and form while making life uncomfortable for tree pests.\n\nStems with narrow, V-shaped angles of attachment (graphic b) often form included bark and should be selected for removal first. Leave branches with strong U-shaped angles of attachment (graphic a). The included bark forms a bark wedge when two stems grow at sharp angles to one another. These ingrown wedges prevent strong attachment of stems often causing a crack at the point below where the branches meet. Removing one or more of the stems will allow the other stem(s) to take over.\n\nBranches growing off these stems should be no more than one half to three-quarters of the diameter of the stem at the point of attachment. Avoid producing \"lion's tails\" or tufts of branches and foliage at the ends of branches by removing all inner lateral branches and foliage. Lion's tails can result in sunscalding, epicormic sprouting and weak branch structure and breakage. Branches that rub or cross another branch should be removed.\n\nTo avoid unnecessary stress and prevent excessive production of epicormic sprouts, no more than one-quarter of the living crown should be removed at a time. If it is necessary to remove more, it should be done over successive years."}

I have three in my back yard, love them!!\n\nYes, dip them in some rooting hormone if possible, but they're not crucial, then stick it into some moist potting mix. Keep the plant in light shade and put a plastic bag over the plant to keep humidity in, but you want to also snip some holes so that some humidity is allowed to escape for heat regulation and to prevent too much water from collecting on the plastic.\n\nThe largest mulberry tree I've ever seen by an order of magnitude is in my parent's backyard.

The white berries are a strain that was originally spread to deter birds from eating them, but the white colored fruit has less flavor than red berries.\n\nMost of the wild type trees are M. alba, introduced from Asia, mixed with native Morus rubra genetics..\n\nAll parts of white mulberry, except for the ripe fruit, contain a milky sap (latex) that is toxic to humans. Although humans may consume ripe mulberry fruit, ingestion of unripe fruit can result in stomach upset, stimulation of the nervous system and hallucinations.\n\nAs everyone else has all ready pointed out, those are Mulberries. They're delicious. They make excellent jam as well. I have a line of red and white mulberries behind my house. My wife harvests them all summer and makes all sorts of goodies with them.

Remove all of these shoots up to the base of the main canopy of the tree to encourage a good shape.\n\nStep 3: Remove dead wood Remove any dead, diseased or damaged wood which is flaking or discoloured. Remove the whole branch if it doesn't have any buds. If it does have buds towards the base of the branch, make a cut just above an outward facing bud. Angle each cut so rain can drain off the stem rather than sitting on top and rotting the plant.\n\nStep 4: Remove crossing branches To encourage your tree to grow in a vase shape, remove any branches that cross over. Vase shaped trees not only look more attractive, they help wind pass through the plant which prevents it catching airborne diseases. Branches that cross may also rub and become infected. Remove these branches at the base, and any other stems that grow inwards rather than outwards.\n\nStep 5: Prune the remaining branches Cut back the rest of the branches by about half their length, to encourage the stems to thicken and develop flowers the following season. Make each cut just above an outward facing bud to encourage a healthy shape.\n\nIf you have some jobs to do in the garden, but are unsure how to go about them, these videos should come in handy to show you step by step what to do, and provide the advice you need.

{"text": "How to Prune Hibiscus Trees\n\nThe hibiscus tree, Hibiscus rosa-sinensis L., is native to China but widely planted in tropical areas of the United States. For most of the year, hibiscus trees produce large flowers that open for only one or two days. The plant blooms on new wood, so heavy pruning greatly reduces flower production. The best course is to prune lightly throughout the year. If heavy pruning must be done, do so in February or March, before the surge of new growth in the spring.\n\nInstructions\n\nClean tools before pruning. Sanitize them with rubbing alcohol or a 10 percent bleach solution before each cut. Use pruning shears or loppers for most cuts.\n\nRemove dead, diseased and broken branches. Make cuts at a 45-degree angle just above a healthy bud, or cut back to the main trunk flush with the branch collar.\n\nPrune out weak branches and branches that rub or interfere with other branches or nearby structures.\n\nMaintain the size and shape of the tree by pruning a few branches each month.

{"text": "Most Popular\n\nMost Recent\n\nHow to Measure Trees\n\nDiameter at breast height, or DBH, is the standard for measuring trees. DBH refers to the tree diameter measured at 4.5 feet above the ground.\n\nDBH can be measured quickly with a specially calibrated diameter tape, often referred to as a d-tape, that displays the diameter measurement when wrapped around the circumference of a tree. If you don't have access to a d-tape, you can find the diameter of the tree using a string, a measuring tape, a thumb tack, and a calculator.\n\nWith the measuring tape, measure 4.5 feet up the trunk of the tree from the ground. Use a thumb tack to mark the height on the tree.\n\nWrap your string around the tree trunk at 4.5 feet. Make sure the string is straight and tight around the trunk, and mark or cut the circumference on the string.\n\nMeasure the length of string to get the circumference of the tree.\n\nConvert the circumference measurement to diameter by dividing the circumference by 3.14.\n\nIf the tree has a branch or a bump at 4.5 feet, it is better to measure the diameter slightly below or above the branch/bump. If the tree forks well below 4.5 above the ground, measure the DBH of each fork individually, square each DBH, add the squares together, and take the square root of that sum.

{"text": "Ash yellows is a disease caused by Candidatus fraxinii, which affects the tree's vascular system or its' phloem sieve tubes. It is presently only found in North America. Ash yellows disease cycle is still a mystery. Experts think it is transmitted by insect vectors such as leaf hoppers which also transmit viruses. Symptoms seem to appear most widely on white ash (Fraxinus americana) than green ash (F. pennsylvanica.) It can also affect at least ten other ashes including black ash (F. nigra) and blue ash (F. quadrangulata.) The ash yellows phytoplasma can also cause symptoms of witches broom in lilacs often called lilac witches broom.\n\nAsh decline is the rapid decline of ash trees including sparse crown growth and dieback. It may be caused by many factors including environmental factors like weather stresses or poor soil conditions and other pathogens like ash yellows.\n\nSymptoms and Diagnosis\n\nSymptoms of ash yellows and decline can vary depending upon ash species and environment conditions.\n\nWhite ash shows the most prominent of symptoms for ash yellows and can result in substantial dieback which leads to premature death of the trees. Trees may show slow twig growth and short internodes among the twigs causing a tufted appearance of foliage and thinning of the overall crown. The symptomatic leaves can be stunted, chlorotic (yellow coloring,) have upturned margins, and premature autumn color. When the branches are slow growing laterally, another symptom is deliquescent branches which lose their apical dominance. Additionally, the branches can have severe dieback. The tree may develop witches broom at the trunk collar and occasionally in major branches as well.\n\nGreen ash can have similar symptoms as white ash but usually less severe. Green ashes can develop witches broom at the base of the tree without the other symptoms. Green ash appears to tolerate ash yellows better than white ash.\n\nObservation of the trees' conditions is very important since adverse environmental conditions can cause similar decline in ash trees as ash yellows. Some environmental factors to look out for are mechanical damage, drought stresses, insect infestations, and parasitic fungi. The witches broom can be diagnostic of the ash yellows but this symptom is not always present with infected ash trees.\n\nAsh decline can be caused by both ash yellows and other environmental factors, mentioned above. Ash decline is typified by growth reduction and crown dieback. Both ash yellows and environmental factors can work together to cause the premature death of the ash tree in as little as 2 years or as many as 10 years once symptoms occur.\n\nMolecular method tests such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are available in diagnostic labs for the ash yellows phytoplasma. At this point, the presence of witches broom is the most reliable diagnostic symptom in the field but not all infected trees have them.\n\nIntegrated Pest Management Strategies\n\n1. Remove the tree. There is no cure for ash yellows. Remove any trees that have severe dieback over 30 to 50% of the crown and decline since the tree will not recover.\n\n2. Improve the vigor of the tree. Although there is no known cure for ash yellows or decline, improving the growing conditions of your tree by watering during drought or fertilizing the tree in the fall can help the tree to live longer and look better.\n\n3. Choose trees suited to the growing conditions. Do not plant ash trees in drought prone areas and reduce competitive plants. Plant a diverse group of trees including other types of trees besides ash trees.\n\n4. Plant more resistant trees. Plant other ash trees besides white and green ash. Some cultivars that have shown to be more resistant to ash yellows are Fraxinus pennsylvanica 'Bergeson,' 'Dakota Centennial\u00ae', 'Patmore,' and Fraxinus americana 'Autumn Applause.'\n\nOrganic Strategies\n\nStrategies 1, 3, and 4 are strictly organic approaches. Organic tree fertilizers are available and could be a viable organic approach to Strategy 2.\n\nMore images:\n\nAsh yellows or decline on ash (Fraxinus)\n\nAsh yellows or decline on ash (Fraxinus)\n\nAsh yellows or decline on ash (Fraxinus)\n\nPests and Problems\n\nClick a link in the site map below to see other \"Pests and Problems\" pages"}

There are many of them due to the drought.\nThank you.\n\nANSWER:\n\nUnfortunately, your Juniperus ashei (Ashe juniper) are most likely dead. Deciduous trees can react to stress by losing their leaves earlier than usual and then re-leaf in the spring or even before spring if the situation causing the stress is alleviated. For instance, this summer during the scorching temperatures and no rain the Juglans nigra (Black walnut) in my yard and the Carya illinoinensis (Pecan) in my neighbor's yard both had most of their leaves turn yellow and fall, but after the 2-inch rain in September they produced new green leaves. Brown evergreens, however, are probably dead evergreens. However, you can test them by bending the smaller branches. If the branches are flexible and full of sap, they're still alive. If they're brittle and dry, they're dead and won't come back. Some of the \"brown\" junipers that are still alive will put out new growth in the spring, but it will be from the tips of branches. If the browned junipers do survive, they're likely to be unattractive for quite some time. That might be reason enough to remove them.\n\nMore Diseases and Disorders Questions"}

Flush cuts made inside the branch bark ridge or branch collar result in the production of a desirable amount of wound-wood on the sides of the pruning wounds with very little wound-wood forming on the top or bottom.\n\nAvoid cuts that leave a partial branch called a stub. Stub cuts result in the death of the remaining branch and wound-wood forms around the base from stem tissues. When pruning small branches with hand pruners, make sure the tools are sharp enough to cut the branches cleanly without tearing. Branches large enough to require saws should be supported with one hand while the cuts are made. If the branch is too large to support, make a three-step pruning cut (graphic c) to prevent the bark ripping or peeling down into good bark.\n\n1. The first cut is a shallow notch made on the underside of the branch, outside the branch collar. This cut will prevent a falling branch from tearing the stem tissue as it pulls away from the tree.\n2. The second cut should be outside the first cut, all the way through the branch, leaving a short stub.\n3.

Brooks)\n\nSymptoms and signs\n\nSymptoms of brown root rot disease are similar to those caused by other root rot pathogens: slow plant growth, yellowing and wilting of leaves, defoliation, branch dieback, and plant death (Figure 2). These aboveground symptoms are caused by a root and butt rot that hinders uptake and transport of water and nutrients from the soil. Fallen trees with visible rot are another general indication of the disease (Figure 3). Although dead wood is initially discolored reddish brown, it later becomes white, dry, and crumbly (Figure 4).\n\nFigure 2\n\nFigure 3\n\nFigure 4\n\nFigure 5\n\nFigure 6\n\nFigure 7\n\nSigns of the pathogen, unlike the symptoms, are distinctive for this disease. Phellinus noxius forms a thick, dark brown to black crust of mycelium around infected roots and lower stems (Figure 5), which gives the disease its name. The leading edge of the crust is creamy white, glistens with drops of clear, brownish exudate, and is usually noticeable even in the dark understory of the rainforest (Figure 6). Patches of white mycelium are present between the bark and sapwood (Figure 7). As colonization progresses, white, soft, crumbly wood becomes laced with reddish strands of fungus hyphae that turn black with age (Figure 8). Sporocarps, or fruiting bodies, are brown to black and rough on the sterile upper surface (Figure 9), gray to gray-brown on the spore-forming lower surface (Figure 10).\n\nFigure 8\n\nFigure 9\n\nFigure 10\n\nPathogen Biology\n\nPhellinus noxius, in the class Basidiomycetes, is a facultative parasite. It obtains nutrients from dead or dying plant tissue, unlike rust or powdery mildew fungi, obligate parasites that require a living hosts for their nutrient supply. As a tropical plant pathogen its mycelium grows best at 25-30\u00b0C (77-86\u00b0F); it does not grow at temperatures below 4\u00b0C (39\u00b0F) or above 40\u00b0C (104\u00b0F). Colonies grown in the laboratory have distinctive raised brown and white plaques and occasionally produce arthrospores, asexual spores formed by division of special hyphae into one-celled segments. Many fungi produce asexual spores that allow them to move within the same plant or from plant to plant. Arthrospores of P. noxius have not been observed in nature, however, and their importance remains unknown.\n\nThe mycelium of P. noxius produces enzymes that break down the middle lamella and cell walls of the plant into simple sugars. This supplies nutrients to the mycelium and allows it to move deeper into the wood. It is sometimes called a white rot fungus (Figure 4) because it degrades lignin, a complex molecule that gives wood much of its strength and brown color. Like brown rot fungi, P. noxius can also break down colorless polysaccharides, but neither as quickly nor as efficiently. Brown rot fungi, however, cannot dissolve lignin and the wood retains its brown color. The mycelium of P. noxius also forms microhyphae and hyphae with extracellular sheaths. These structures are found where wood is being destroyed but their exact function is not yet known.\n\nSexual Reproduction\n\nBasidiospores of P. noxius contain one nucleus (monokaryotic) and are haploid. When haploid hyphae (n) of different mating types touch each other, they can fuse (plasmogamy) to form a dikaryotic mycelium with cells containing two haploid nuclei (n + n). This dikaryotic mycelium is the most common condition in nature. The hyphae can be modified\u2014swelling, thickening, or sticking together\u2014to produce a mycelial crust or sporocarps. The latter often start as small round patches on stems of dead trees (Figure 11). Patches may continue to grow flat against the wood (effused, Figure 12), grow out into a shelf-like conk (reflexed, Figure 13), or a combination of both (effused-reflexed, Figure 14). The upper surface of reflexed and effused-reflexed sporocarps is sterile, the lower fertile surface covered with small tubes, or pores. These pores are lined with basidia, whose two nuclei fuse (karyogamy) and undergo meiosis, producing four haploid basidiospores (Figure 15). During wet weather basidiospores are released and spread by the wind.\n\nFigure 11\n\nFigure 12\n\nFigure 13\n\nFigure 14\n\nFigure 15\n\nPhellinus noxius sporocarps are sometimes confused with those of P. lamaensis, another tropical Phellinus species. Phellinus lamaensis sporocarps have short, reddish-brown, cone-shaped cells called hymenial setae growing into their pores (Figure 16), however, and P. noxius does not (Figure 17).\n\nFigure 16\n\nFigure 17\n\nDisease Cycle and Epidemiology\n\nEpidemiology\n\nPhellinus noxius is present in native tropical forests and plantations on infected roots and stumps and in woody debris. It does not form survival structures, such as sclerotia or resting spores, but may persist in dead roots and colonized wood for many years. Centers of disease radiate outward as roots of healthy trees come in contact with roots of diseased trees. Trees of all ages are susceptible. A mycelial crust forms around infected roots, secreting wood-rotting enzymes as it moves up the roots to the stem. Crusts 0.5-1.0 cm thick usually extend 1-2 m (3-6 ft) up the stem, though crusts almost 5 m (15 ft) high have been measured (Figure 18). If the tree does not die from severe root rot, it is killed when the crust surrounds the stem and the underlying mycelium destroys the sapwood. Sporocarps occasionally develop on standing dead trees, stumps, or trees blown down following severe root decay. Infection of freshly cut stumps or wounds by windborne basidiospores has been demonstrated experimentally but is not as important to disease spread as root-to-root contact. Basidiospores may, however, be responsible for some long distance dispersal of the fungus.\n\nFigure 18\n\nDisease Management\n\nTropical forests cleared for planting must be carefully surveyed for trees and stumps with signs or symptoms of brown root rot. Partial success has been obtained by pushing diseased trees and stumps into piles with a tractor and burning them. Some infected roots and debris will still remain in the soil, however, so newly planted trees that develop symptoms should be removed, roots and all, as quickly as possible. Leaving land fallow for several years or planting annual crops with vigorous root systems to break down remaining debris may offer the best approaches but they are seldom practiced due to economic considerations.\n\nDecreasing root contact reduces spread of the fungus. This is especially important in monocultures (see lesson on Dutch elm disease), as disease usually spreads faster in single-species plantings than in mixed-species plantings. Trees should be planted close enough together for maximum yield but far enough apart to minimize root contact. Thinning to remove large diameter trees reduces disease spread by removing their extensive root systems.\n\nChemical control is not economical on a large scale and tree varieties of important crop species resistant to Phellinus noxius have not been developed. Future solutions may be found in genetic engineering or classic biological control methods.\n\nSignificance\n\nThe spread of root diseases in native rainforests is usually restrained by differences in local conditions, such as soil type, plant density and diversity, and microorganisms. Clearing forests upsets this restraint. When E. J. Corner described Fomes noxius (now Phellinus noxius) as a new species in 1932, he said it was usually found in cleared or disturbed areas; recent surveys tend to support this. Since the beginning of the 20th century, many plantations of rubber, tea, cocoa, coffee, oil palm, and mahogany established on cleared forests sites have been damaged or destroyed by P. noxius.\n\nAs growing populations in tropical countries convert agricultural land to other uses, remaining native forests are cleared for plantations, large-scale farms, and subsistence agriculture (Figure 19). Tropical soils are quickly depleted of nutrients, however, and may be lost to erosion during heavy monsoon rains. Further, the presence of fungal pathogens such as P. noxius can destroy even the most carefully managed venture. Some scientists are also concerned with loss of genetic diversity, both by the open killing of endangered species and by destruction of their habitats. An estimated 70% of the world's species live in tropical forests and these forests are being cleared at the rate of 0.5 to 2% per year (Figure 20)."}
