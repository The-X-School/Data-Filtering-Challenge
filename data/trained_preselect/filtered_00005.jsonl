The concept of an atom as an indivisible\nmaterial particle was combined with that\nof the ultimate imaginable constituent of the ideals about the Universe.\nThese dual views were reflected in the primary\nmathematical concepts of Euclid's\nElements:\nA point, an atom of geometry, is that which has no parts; whereas\na monad, an atom of arithmetic,\nis that by virtue of which each of the things that exist is called one.\n\nThe views of the world in the age of the microscope and telescope\ngave rise to the two forms of differential and integral calculus.\nLebniz's monadology and Newton's method of prime and ultimate ratios\nreflect the dual nature of the ancient ideas of the microcosm.\nRobinson's nonstandard analysis has splendidly\nunited and completed the development of the two-millennia old conceptions,\npaving the best way to the classical calculus.\n\nThe present-day physical views have little in common\nwith the atomism of the ancients.\nWe perceive the laws of the microworld within\nthe framework of quantum mechanics and the uncertainty principle\nalien to Aristotle's logic.\nOmnipresent is the process of discretization and constructivization\nof applied mathematics which is connected with the prominent\nrole of the technologies based on physical binary devices.\n\nMathematics must constantly fit itself to\nthe common paradigms of science.\nRobinson's nonstandard analysis\ncrowns the old-fashioned ideas of the ancient atomism.\nMankind will never waste out its intellectual treasures.\nTherefore, nonstandard analysis in some form will be the\n\"analysis of the\nfuture\" as forecasted by Gödel.\nNevertheless, there are no grounds to\nthink that the calculus of Newton and Leibniz\nwill play a key role in the formation of the outlook of the future\ngenerations.\n\nThe low demand for the contemporary infinitesimal analysis is\nnot connected only with the lack of new textbooks\nand the conservatism and ignorance of tutors.\nIn fact, the problem relates to the status of the classical calculus\nrather than the modern approaches of nonstandard set theory.\n\nThe main reason of stagnation in teaching\nis the diminishing of vitality of what is taught."

It was intended to explore the experimental aspect (with the building of simple circuit prototype), the analytic (with the resolution of equations and linear systems, with an introduction to the linear programming) and the computer (with the use of electronic chart). In all the topics developed, a special emphasis is given to the interpretation, analysis and validating of the results. With this material, it was intended to offer the teacher a set of didatic- pedagogical activities that can stimulate the critical and creative acting.

Avoiding excessive abstraction whenever possible, the text focuses on the central problem of studying the solutions of polynomial equations. Highlights include a proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, essentially due to Euler, and a proof of the constructability of the regular 17-gon, in the manner of Gauss. Another novel feature is the introduction of groups through a meditation on the meaning of congruence in the work of Euclid. Everywhere in the text, the goal is to make clear the links connecting abstract algebra to Euclidean geometry, high school algebra, and trigonometry. Another goal is to encourage students, insofar as possible in a textbook format, to build the course for themselves, with exercises integrally embedded in the text of each chapter."

Through the lesson, students recognized the significance of learning about the relationship between roots and coefficients, and understanded the idea of symmetry and were interested in new solutions.

      "text": "TEACHING OF MATHEMATICS WITH MATHEMATICA IN ARCHITECTURE\n\nThe classical role of the teaching of mathematics in the studies of Architecture has been the transmission of knowledge, methods and mathematical results to the service of quantitative aspects and procedures related to technical topics. The abstract character of the mathematics has often carried to discussions about the presence of this discipline in the schools of Architecture. Nevertheless, the application of the new technologies to the technical problems has allowed changing the vision of the necessity of the teaching of the mathematics in Architecture.\n\nFrom the School of Architecture of the University of Granada we try to transmit to the students the mathematical knowledge so that they assimilate which are the mathematical tools they have to consider to solve the different problems that could appear in their studies, as well as later in the exercise of the profession.\n\nWe try to carry out this transmission of knowledge in such a way that the classes do not turn out to be tedious to the students, and in order that they do not see the mathematics only as a subject they must deal with to obtain the degree. Quite the contrary, we try to show the mathematics in a practical way to the students, trying that the classes be understandable and even pleasant. In this regard we count with the advantage that a great part of the contents of mathematics in Architecture are related to the study of the plane and the space, topics in which the students get on very well due to their spatial vision.\n\nTo achieve this end, we have designed a great number of applications with Mathematica that have improved the teaching, since they have allowed us to transmit to the students in a more graphical and intuitive form the mathematical concepts, specially the geometric ones, as the movements in the plane and the space and the theory of curves and surfaces. Besides, other contents as derivatives, integrals and their applications, or the resolution of differential equations are also presented to the students by using Mathematica.\n\nAs we explore in depth the use of Mathematica, we conclude that to handle with ingenuity the commands relative to lists, integrals, equations, etc, not only opens new facets of the use of the program, but also it saves a lot of work at the moment of the comprehension of the raised problems as well as time in obtaining the solution."

In particular, the constitutive equations of the DC motor and the 3-phase asynchronous motor are constructed starting from the principles of electromagnetism.\n\nIn the DC motor, the analysis of the stator and the rotor will lead us to equations containing the torque generated by the motor, the angular velocity, the current in the armature circuit, the current in the excitation circuit, the electromotive force generated by induction, the excitation flux, and more. We will explain the behavior of the motor through the equations; their derivation will foster comprehensive understanding of the dynamics of the motor.\n\nThe theory of the 3-phase asynchronous motor will require more lectures to be developed, due to the greater physical and mathematical difficulty of this type of motors. The stator and the rotor are analyzed using complex vectors. First, the electromagnetic field in the air gap between the stator and the rotor is derived, which will then allow to find the flux. Finding the flux is necessary because this physical quantity appears in the constitutive equations of the motor. Besides, the mechanical and electric power generated by the motor will be discussed and mathematically derived in the course, as well as the torque, angular frequency of the rotor, and the parameter called \"slip\". The characteristic curve of the torque will also be plotted against the angular velocity of the motor.\n\nPrerequisites\n\nStudents should be familiar with complex vectors and calculus.

Therefore, \"to resolve the issue\" is a process that is a purpose and a capacity. Conic is the focus of high school mathematics is difficult, over the years is a compulsory test of knowledge one point. Students interested in math when the attitude of the conic involved in understanding the basic concepts of how they reflect on the conic mathematical way of thinking: Algebra and geometry Combination ideas, equations and functions of thinking, thinking of the analogy with the use of the vector How. This is a direct bearing on the settlement of conic problem with the proficiency of accurate.This article uses the overall quality and quantity of analysis, survey and testing in the form of volume in Shanghai's secondary focus of 151 students in research.This has come to address the students in the conic problems that exist in a number of questions:1. Only 30% of the Institute of Health and the direct use of conic section for the definition of track and the focus of a long string, and the remaining students through the coordinates of the method, most of the students on the Conic insufficient definition.2. students in the form of equations of the standard understanding of the single, most of the students with coordinates corresponding, shape and does not correspond to the number of very good hands.3. Mathematical way of thinking because of the lack of understanding of the connotations, and the students themselves to solve problems in the existing obstacles to thinking, students use mathematical way of thinking taper curve of a comprehensive settlement of the issue is the ability of the weak .Based on the above three issues, the paper for teachers to improve students problem-solving ability, self control, applied mathematics knowledge capacity of an effective way to several proposals:1. APOSE to improve the use of the concept of teaching2. Teachers to improve teaching strategies, emphasis on math teaching methods. At the same time improve their own self-cultivation of mathematics, problem-solving skills, teaching to break the formation of thinking. So as to achieve a broader effort to enhance students thinking, creative thinking, such as quality.3.

      "text": "IN planning the present book, the author has kept in mind three aspects of the teacher's preparation: the need of the perspective gained through a comprehen sion of the larger teaching problems concerned in the teaching of arithmetic, the need of a clear insight into the content of arithmetic, and the need of an understand ing of arithmetic method. The book exploits no new doctrine. It lays no claim to completeness. It has been prepared with the primary aim of supplying the practical needs of prospective teachers, or teachers new in the ser vice. On account Of the efiort made to refresh the mind of the reader in the subject matter of arithmetic, the read ing frequently goes beyond the requirements of the grades, this being especially noticeable in the treatment of percen tage and in the solution of problems. If any dogmatism appears in the context, it is the result of efiorts to be clear and convincing.\n\nQuestion: What is the reason for any dogmatism that might appear in the context? Answer: Any dogmatism that appears in the context is the result of efforts to be clear and convincing."
